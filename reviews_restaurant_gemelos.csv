"September 8, 2014",50,Best view in Greece!,"This is a very nice family style Greek Raverna. Good food and plentiful company, it is right on the main street of Ancient Corinth, just outside the exit from the grounds of the Temple of Apollo. There is a veranda on the third level with a stunning view of all of the ruins, including the Temple and the Lechaion Road, as well as the pubic Baths of the site. Without fail you MUST find a reason to use the men's bathrooms on the median level. Inside there is a small widow, as there is in many of these places. Look out of that.....and you see the entirety of the ruins and the south Stoa! It is spectacular.  We went several times and now the owner says we have to come back and stay at his house on our next trip! It is Greek hospitality at it;s friendliest."
"August 19, 2014",50,What a view - the highlight of our trip,Go hear and have lunch on the terrace overlooking the ruins of Ancient Corinth - you will not be disappointed. You get a bird's eye view so can save on the entrance fee to the ruins (thus making lunch a bargain). They do a great set lunch full of Greek delicacies - loads of courses all for 12 euros. It really is worth coming here!
