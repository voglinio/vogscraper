"November 2, 2022",5.0,Beautiful beach,"Incredibly beautiful place Water was very clear, great for snorkeling and swimming. Though there's some jellyfish but easy to dodge Had a boat tour to see the caves and nearby area Went late October and it was very peaceful"
"October 30, 2022",5.0,Had it all,"Our lovely day trip to Paleokastritsa had it all a beautiful clean beach with free sunbeds, a shady walk up to the monastery for a bit of history and breath taking views form the terrace of the modern Greek restaurant on top of the cliffs. üëçüëçüëçüëç We have been in October it was quiet not many tourists"
"October 25, 2022",5.0,Definitely would revisit,"So so beautiful! Crystal clear waters, mostly sandy beaches, a few restaurants and shops and activities. Really recommend getting the 45 minute boat tour round the bays, very reasonable. Would definitely come back, worth the visit."
"October 12, 2022",1.0,Destroyed by mass tourism,"This place makes me think of a joke drawing I saw many years ago. A family was sitting at a picnic table nea a lake in a forrest. In the distance a deer was eating, and the atmosphere exuded peace and idyll. ""It is so lovely and quiet here, why don't they place the cities here so everyone can enjoy it,"" the wife said. This is exactly what has happened to Paleokastritsa. We were there during our first visit to Corfu back in 1974, and it was a wonderful place. Today it is completely destroyed by the overwhelming mass tourism - they have simply moved the city out there."

"September 30, 2022",5.0,Nice!,Beautiful place with awesome panoramical views. Go on there and see it by your eyes. I hope you will get excited!
"September 30, 2022",2.0,Not worth a visit,"We decided to revisit Paleokastritsa beach having not visited for many years & sadly wished we hadn‚Äôt bothered. We managed to find a free parking place in the coach/car parking area, but that was the only plus point to our visit. Unbelievably coming to the end of the season they were still charging ‚Ç¨30.00 for two sun beds & an umbrella for the day & ‚Ç¨20.00 after 14.00, we dreaded to think what the charge was in high season! It was not a pleasant experience as the beach was very busy & the beds too close together. We would not return."
"September 29, 2022",5.0,My favorite,Love it here. Love the views. A short boat ride to paradise beach for a day of sun and swimming. It's a must. So worth a day of your time.
"September 27, 2022",5.0,Beautiful,"Simply beautiful, perfect beach and crystal clear water.. Must do a boat trip around the bay to appreciate how stunning it is!"
"September 27, 2022",2.0,Not Happy,"The experience cannot be improved. The whole of Corfu were in Paleokastritsa Beach the day we went. The view from mountains where we had lunch were stunning, but getting down the mountain into area was a nightmare. Coaches tooo big for roads, traffic parking 2-3 KM away from centre and people having tom walk into area:( then getting back out was equally as bad. On arrival and finding NO parking available (we are 65/67 respectively) and NOT willing to walk up and down a mountain we left."
"September 25, 2022",2.0,Nothing special but far,"nothing special but far away... only worth it if you are staying somewhere nearby... too far from Kerkyra... the hosts are all unfriendly, the prices are too high, the quality of the food is zero... we paid 160 euros for a very bad lunch (5 people) with the feeling that we are not welcome in the restaurant... we will never see each other again"
"September 25, 2022",4.0,Very nice sandy beach,"Lovely Sandy Beach. A bit stoney as you enter the sea, but goes sandy again within a few metres. Sunbeds ‚Ç¨30 for the day for 2x beds & umbrella (with reduced price for a short stay if you are cheeky enough to ask), but cheaper as the day passes, but there is an area where you just use towels etc. Gets very busy with a mix of all ages. Bars, restaurants, shops all near by. Toilets a bit sparse, with local restaurants etc available. There are 2x more beaches within 150 metres, both stony & can get very windy. Green line bus stops in the carpark behind the beach"
"September 18, 2022",3.0,"Overrated, crowded","A nice little beach and picturesque views, cold water though, very crowded. Long way from corfu town."
"September 17, 2022",2.0,Disappointed,"Crowdy beach with a lot of sunbeds, expensive restoraunts with quality below that we used to have on Corfu island. We have visited this place following trip adviser list for Corfu beaches and this is the only beach that disappointed us and we left after couple of hours."
"September 15, 2022",4.0,Beautiful but very expensive,"The beach is stunning and worth a visit for the day. Beautiful views and sandy beach it‚Äôs wonderful. If you want a sun bed and umbrella then be prepared to take out a small loan. It‚Äôs ‚Ç¨30 for two people which many people were upset about and argued with the people who were selling it. To save money bring a towel, get an umbrella from the shop and save your money. We paid as a one off treat but if you are staying close please have a think about it."
"September 11, 2022",3.0,Too expensive,Beach is beautiful but all the services are overpriced. We were asked 30 EUR to use 2 sunbeds and an umbrella while in other near by places you pay between 10 and 15
"September 6, 2022",5.0,A dream,"Gougeous water, view, place and energy. Heaven on earth. little beach, crowded bu such a goof energy. I liked eatimg at Nikos"
"August 31, 2022",5.0,A must place to visit in Corfu,"Paleokastritsa is one of the most beautiful places in Greece. If you visit Corfu, you can't miss the experience of swimming in the crystal-clear blue emerald sea, framed by cypresses and olive trees and covered by bougainvillea and hibiscuses.  A boat ride to the caves, shared or private, is also a great way to admire the coast and hidden coves of the area.  This is a great place to spend a few hours, or even a whole day until the sunset."
"August 30, 2022",4.0,Great swimming soot,Recommended to come here by a local. Busy little place with shops and tavernas. While my wife shopped I got changed in one of a few beach huts and went for a swim. Water much cooler than east coast but not uncomfortable. Very clear with lots of shoals of fishes so a great snorkelling spot. There are boat trips to the caves or you can hire a boat but I did neither. After swimming I have a really nice ice cream before heading up to the ruined castle that overlooks this part of Corfu.
"August 26, 2022",2.0,"Terrific view, noisy, crowded, messy beach","We stayed for one day on this beach. Excellent view but...ghe beach is very tiny and crowded. 2 sunbeds with umbrela cost us 30‚Ç¨, no drinks included. The beach is somewherw below the street and the persons who are passing by the street are throwing with sand and small garbage when they walk (unintention). A lots of busses stoping by with tourists. Very noisy, very crowdy. As i said, the view is very nice because of the nice rocks and crystal clear water. Btw the water is...frozen."
"August 23, 2022",3.0,August crowds,Beautiful beach but far too crowded. Barely any room to lie down. Lovely walk up to the monestry which gives great views of the bay.
"August 21, 2022",5.0,Day trip,Georges. Highly recommend visit. Monastery is must see and restaurant right next to it is excellent for lunch and dinner.
"August 15, 2022",3.0,"Beautiful nature, overcrowded, clear and cold water","That's the description of this northwest Corfu town in one sentence. The nature is really beautiful - spread around several bays and best seen from the Angelokastro castle above. Parking is a nightmare - very difficult to find a spot. The town is heavily overcrowded, so I didn't enjoy it. The sea is crystal clear, but very cold due to underwater springs."
"August 10, 2022",3.0,Beach day,"Went to beach in Mid August. Over crowding an issue, parking difficult. Changing areas difficult to assess. Would recommend other beaches in Northern Corfu such as Kerasi or avlaki. On positive side water was reasonably clear, but no more so than other beaches in northern Corfu."
"August 9, 2022",1.0,Horribly overhyped and overcrowded,"I'm sure this beach used to be a scenic gem. I'm sure you used to be able to enjoy an amazing day out here. But you can be even more sure that those days are long gone. Unless you get here around 7-8am, don't even bother unless you're happy to stand on a road in the blazing sun all day. You simply won't get a sunbed or umbrella, not even a debate. And even if you do get there early, the inevitable flurry of people will eventually ruin any good experience you may have squeezed out of the beach. Wanna eat or drink? There's three nearby restaurants, all of which you need to wait an hour to sit at.  I really don't understand the hype. We were staying in Agios Gordios, and the beach there is literally miles better despite barely being hyped at all. I almost feel scammed to have paid to go on an 'excursion' here, considering how much better Agios Gordios is.  Be prepared to waste a day of your holiday if you come here."
"August 7, 2022",4.0,Great beach,One of the best beaches of Corfu.But you have to be there at 8 in the morning or earlier if you want to find a place to sit down.
"August 7, 2022",5.0,Paleokastritsa experiance,"We had a vacation in Corfu, a d we have visit Paleokastritsa also. There are some spectacular views and 3 small beaches very quiet and nice with a o lot of fish inside. So water glasses are mandatory :) The prices are also Ok. For sure we will come back."
"August 6, 2022",2.0,Beautiful nature but...,"I think that you should arrive in Paleokastritsa only by bike or on feet. The streets to get there by scooter are very hard if you are a NON resident Person. And the quality of the same Is not good. When you'll arrive at the beach Is full of people and It Is difficult to find a Place with umbrella and beds. The Sea Is special but of you don't have a boat rented before It Is usefull beacause you can't see the caves, and fishes or turtles that are there around.."
"July 30, 2022",5.0,"excellent beach, clear waters and nice beach bar","The waters were very clear, the view was amazing. A lot of people but we were served in the best way."
"July 28, 2022",4.0,"AMAZING place to swim, crowded sand","The water is magical here!! It's crystal clear blue and there are some fish you can see when snorkling. The beach itself is packed with tourists though, so can be a little crazy. Another positive is you can grab boats and water taxis here to cruise around the caves and nearby beaches. SO MUCH FUN!"
"July 23, 2022",2.0,Nice but dirty & over crowded,"Beach with natural beauty. But very crowded, expensive the sunbeds, dirty, full of jellyfishes and nothing spectacular to see -as advertised. We were not very impressed."
"July 22, 2022",3.0,Not for us,Decided to take a drive into Paleokastritsa just to see what all the fuss was about. We had no plans to stay but took a few photos. Yes it‚Äôs pretty but it was so overcrowded it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant place to be. In fact I found it quite stressful so we didn‚Äôt actually stay long. I get why some people love it but just not for us.
"July 15, 2022",5.0,Boat trip to the Blue Caves,"Delighted to find boat trips available from the beach to the Blue Caves. Small boats (about 20 people), inexpensive (‚Ç¨10), for about 45 minutes. No need to book and there's a boat every 10 minutes. Really interesting trip to 4 caves, which the small boat can enter. Highly recommended, and not advertised anywhere on TripAdvisor or in guidebooks."
"July 13, 2022",2.0,Overrated!!!,"It doesn't deserve the name ""the most beautiful beach in Corfu"". On the south you have much more astonishing beaches, like Santa Barbara beach. Also the water is so cold, as swimmimg in the river. The beach is to packed."
"July 12, 2022",5.0,Beautiful!,"We hired a minus bus 10 of us, to get here. The beach was beautiful but the water was cold. Nice scenery. A must visit when in Corfu."
"July 10, 2022",5.0,Paradise,"This is a lovely place to visit, we went on a boat trip to see the caves and then swam at the beach. Just spent the dat there."
"July 10, 2022",2.0,Not sure what all the fuss is about,"Hugely overrated but still incredibly busy. Tiny beaches absolutely heaving with people. Backdrop is ok but there are arguably prettier backdrops eg Agios Giordios, Santa Barbara etc. Managed to park for free on the roadside which offset the horrific ‚Ç¨20 sunbed cost.  Avoid unless you really have to."
"July 5, 2022",4.0,Nice beach,"The beach is nice, water is clean but a little bit colder then on the other side of the island. The taverna is ‚Äúok‚Äù, but nothing special."
"July 1, 2022",4.0,Beautiful,Crystal clear water in all shades of blue and a pretty pebbly beach. There is a car park for 5 euros or park on the road and walk down.
"June 26, 2022",1.0,"Pretty bay, now totally spoilt by commercialism","Visited by bus from Corfu town. Ok, it WAS a Saturday, but we couldn‚Äôt believe how busy it was. Even if we‚Äôd wanted a sunbed on the beach, there were very few to be had. We had coffee in one of the tavernas when we arrived (Vrachos, I think). No problem. Less than an hour later, while I was having a walk around, my husband wanted just a cold drink in the shade to wait for me. No, he couldn‚Äôt come inside unless he was having lunch. The only place they would serve him with a drink was at a table in full sunshine (it was 35C). Same story at a different caf√©. Having spent some time on Paxos before finishing off our holiday in Corfu, we had got used to the friendliness and helpfulness we encountered there, so found this experience extremely disappointing. It‚Äôs a shame that such a beautiful place can no longer be enjoyed as it should be. We didn‚Äôt stay long, and certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend a visit unless you want to be packed on to the beach like sardines or treated with only profit in kind, even if you‚Äôre an older person who just wants a shady seat. What a pity."
"June 26, 2022",1.0,Too many people,"Too touristy, lots of people, busy, noisy, almost no place in the water. We went straight away when we arrived. Maybe it‚Äôs nice in off-season for the natural beauty."
"June 16, 2022",2.0,Overated,"I don‚Äôt know how the staff on this beach keep a straight face when asking 20 euros for 2 standard sun beds and a brolly it‚Äôs unbelievable, it‚Äôs only a couple of years ago the 8 euro was at the high end . Then to add insult to injury I never received a receipt and the chairs behind were so close other‚Äôs peoples feet were touching my bed , and the none stop noise of loud shouting all day not a pleasant experience, the view in the cove is nice but the beach nothing special, narrow strip of sand then pebbly all the was to the sea , I‚Äôve been on many better Greek beach‚Äôs , we would normal get sun beds all week but never returned here their loss and the traders around them , do not pay it ."
"June 13, 2022",2.0,Not for me at all. Way too busy and packed.,"Quite a small beach packed full of people, it was chaos with cars, coaches, buses etc and crowds. We couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. Very touristy!"
"June 11, 2022",5.0,Must do,"Really nice views of the beech, make sure to get there early to avoid crowds. Boats tours was really worth what it cost. Guide was a nice and informative. Would highly recommend."
"May 18, 2022",5.0,Amazing,"Sure it's one of the best beaches on the island. You can't miss it when u arrive at Paleokastritsa. The colour of the sea, the caves to visit by boat... amazing. We visited the place in May and it wasn't too busy."
"May 8, 2022",5.0,Great day in May.,"Great views sea great to swim in good bars good parking. But hey this was Mat , no doubt it is very very crowded and busy July an August. We hired a speed boat on the foot, in high season u will need to book in advance 2 to 3 days or even more ."
"May 6, 2022",4.0,"Busy, even out of season","The beach is good for swimming and you can also catch a boat trip out to the sea caves. There are also cafes, car park (5euros) and the usual tat shops. The beach is stony and for a way into the water (there is a smaller beach area on the far side of the car park which is actually more sandy). The Corfu Aquarium is alongside the car park but we didn‚Äôt go inside. We visited late April and the area was quite busy, so goodness knows what it‚Äôs like in the summer."
"May 5, 2022",5.0,"Great place, cold crystal clear waters",Crystal clear waters ideal for the hot weather of paleokastritsa.Many beach bars n cozy restaurants near by
"April 22, 2022",4.0,Nice beach,Awesome beach!  Drove to visit the monastery and stopped on the beach! Parked by the beach only to find police ticketing people! So beware!  The beach was lovely and Sandy! No shells tho! Quite a few people on the beach! When officers started ticketing peoples parked cars‚Ä¶ people started disappearing with their cars
"February 13, 2022",5.0,Stunning,Couldn‚Äôt swim because it is February but cant wait to come back! The bus service was great Nothing is open in the off season so bring lunch
"December 4, 2021",5.0,Great beach,Great place to see on Corfu. The bars were too expansive. I have not visit the monastery which was bad decision. Maybe next timeüò™
"October 29, 2021",3.0,Nicer beaches and coves eleswhere,"I am not sure why this beach is described as lovely, it probably depends on what you like. There seemed to be a few bays some pretty, some not. all very crowded and this was September. There are much nicer coves on Corfu. We ended up getting a sunbed at the Aquarium the pricing/deals we found very confusing. We did go for a walk over the cliffs which was strenuous but there were good views and a few cafes on route to stop for a break"
"October 22, 2021",5.0,Crowdy but marvelous,Beautiful place. Lot of tourists even in September. But the place is really marvelous. Lot of restaurants with local food.
"October 13, 2021",3.0,Beautiful but too crowdy,It really depends on what you are after. If you like hustle and bustle and being around other people then this is for sure a place for you. Both main beaches are usually packed. The views are stunning but it wasnt to our likings - we did went up to the monastery and walked around but didn't fancy staying longer. I can see the appeal but its very commercialised and full of tourists place.
"October 13, 2021",5.0,Lovely beach!,Really lovely and beautiful place:) If you are in Corfu then this is must be place for visit. Nice taverns and Corfu Aquarium.
"October 9, 2021",5.0,A gorgeous area of Corfu with stunning scenery,"Paleokastritsa comprises a number of lovely bays and coves with nice little beaches, surrounded by imposing scenery all around. The views are superb! The water is crystal clear and calm, ideal for swimming, and you can see fish everywhere. The Blue Lagoon is a magical place! There are plenty of restaurants, tavernas, bars and cafes in the area, many with wonderful views. Probably the loveliest part of Corfu!"
"October 1, 2021",4.0,Crystal waters,"We swam here many times during our stay. As with probably every accessible beach in the whole Mediterranean, it can get crowded; even in September, when we were there. I preferred to swim earlier in the day, while beach spots were still available and before the daily film of sun-oil began to accumulate on the water surface. As I say, this is unavoidable, it is not a feature of Agios Spiridon beach as such. With that proviso, it is a lovely place to swim in the warm Med. The water really does have that ultramarine clarity the photos suggest. The deep bay between olive-wooded hills provides shelter from the wind, while still allowing in plenty of sun. The beach itself is sand, with occasional stones which come in handy for weighting the corners of your towel. :) The sand extends more or less to waist depth, but from there I recommend you swim to pass over a belt of rocks. (Standing on these is probably not a good idea because sea urchins lurk here and there among them.) Fresh water showers are available, also change cabins, and there are many adjacent places to have lunch and enjoy the view."
"September 27, 2021",3.0,Beautiful but very busy,This is a beautiful area but far too bustling for my taste. I think it would be great for families and people who enjoy the bustle of a big resort.
"September 23, 2021",5.0,Paleo Rental,I have been visiting Paleokastritsa for 26 years. I have hired so many cars and motorbikes from Paleo Rentals over this time and never had a bad car or bike. I have just returned after yet another holiday in my favourite place and was given a brand new car for my stay. I agreed to take it back a day before I left and was going to hire a motorbike for the last day. When I got there the weather had changed and we were in for a little rain in late September so Spiros told me to keep the car until the following morning. My loyalty remains with this family as I have never had a bad deal or vehicle in all of these years.
"September 18, 2021",5.0,Fantastic!,It's a must see if you go to Corfu. The views are breath taking especially from the top of the rocks. They are more beautiful in reality than in the touristic brochures.
"September 17, 2021",5.0,Superb excursion,"Wonderful small beaches with cristall clear blue water. The beaches were not crowded, cafees and restaurants were nearby, and a big parking lot is right adjacent to two of the best beaches. A real treat, worthwhile even for a couple of hours excursion!"
"September 14, 2021",1.0,Very disappointing,Big disappointment. Small crowded beach in all 5 bays. Place is one big car park. View from monastery is good but there are lots of other places in corfu with good views. Buildings have no planning and a lot of it was scruffy as are a lot of places in Corfu.
"September 4, 2021",5.0,Beautiful beach and surroundings,Beautiful beach but it was quite crowded when we were there in August. It's not a very wide beach but is well worth a visit.
"August 29, 2021",1.0,Lame,"Absolutely crowded! We paied 15 euros for 1st line sundebs and umbrella, only to see that 10 minutes after we paid they placed chairs in front of us. Not to mention that by noon we were overran by the endless flow of people. Worst beach on Corfu. Water is great, really scenic but this does not compensate for the lame beach line. Don't visit!"
"August 25, 2021",5.0,The Sunbeds and parasols from the Aquarium are the best,"So beautiful - turquoise water, perfect for snorkeling - lots of fish to see. The first beach is over crowded but I was nicely surprised that the Aquarium have sunbeds and parasols. It costs only 5\7.5 euros per person and the best thing is you can use it for drinks and food at the bar so they are basically for free. We could easily find free ones on a Monday - not sure about the weekend. The bus stop for A9 is just between the two small beaches and it is very convenient."
"August 17, 2021",5.0,Lovely Day,Beautiful place to visit if not staying there as very picturesque. Would recommend to go early and park in main car park down between the 2 main bays which then looks up to the monastery and at 4 euros for the day is cheap but does get full by 12ish I recon. Few touristy shops and tavernas to eat at but lovely to swim in the crystal clear water of the bays and you can hire pedalo's and boats to.
"August 17, 2021",3.0,Overcrowded and small.,"I'm not sure why this place have so many stars? Beach itself is nice but extremely overcrowded, most of the beach is filled up with beach chairs so if you want to use your own towel and umbrela there is no much space. Also part of the beach is occupied by watersports equipment which takes around 10 meters of allready tiny space left, and the right hand side of the beach is reserved for small marina/jetty. Just behind your back is very busy road, not nice to breathe all this fumes.. Lastly parking is littered with all sort of rubish! I don't understand why local council is not looking after that. All in all there are much better beaches around."
"August 15, 2021",3.0,nice beach but full of wasp and people,"Beautiful beach, but lots of wasps so be aware if allergic or afraid. Also full of tourist and locals and it can be difficult to find a spot"
"August 15, 2021",3.0,To many tourists.,I would reccoment to visit this beach by boat and not with any other vehicle. The place is very touristic and busy. Not a relaxing place to be. However the beach is beatiful to snorkel and swim.
"August 9, 2021",5.0,Dreamy,"This small town is picture perfect, what a dream. The views, the water. I spend a full day there and really enjoyed it. A boat tour to the caves i would really recommend It does get very busy here."
"August 7, 2021",4.0,Beautiful but crowded and commercialized,A beutiful spot on the island but not a place for romance or privacy. If you are there with kids its nice. There are a few touristy places to shop and eat
"August 5, 2021",1.0,Avoid,"If you get to this beach very early, it is very pretty. However don‚Äôt bother if it‚Äôs after 11. It‚Äôs so crowded it‚Äôs hard to even walk. Also boats and swimmers share the same water which seemed incredibly dangerous and no life guards were present. Also whatever you do DO NOT go on the cave tours run by the men directly on the beach. Huge scam. We didn‚Äôt see a single cave and the boat nearly tipped 3x. They claimed we couldn‚Äôt see the caves due to the ‚Äúweather‚Äù yet failed to disclose this before we got on the boat and had advertised that we would be going to the caves. Scam artists and not worth your safety. I‚Äôm sure there are safer and better options for cave tours then the men on the beach. The photo is of the receipt we got from the boat company. We aren‚Äôt sure what the name of the company is."
"July 23, 2021",4.0,Beautiful landscape,"Beautiful beach, with cristal blue waters but very cold always. You can choose between bringing your own chairs and umbrelas or renting. Also you can rent little boats to have some fun. Surrounded by green cliffs, its a very nice place to spend a full day. There are tavernas also and a snack bar and a big parking place for 10Euro/day."

"October 14, 2020",4.0,"its lovely, but there's better","nice little beach right in town, chairs to rent, pedalloes, boat trips to cave etc. close to shops and cafes. pretty bay - but with just a bit more effort there are much better beaches. - depending, of course, on what you like. for me, less is more."
"October 12, 2020",4.0,Holiday,Most beautiful island however 1st visit probably last some lovely places however oct too many wasps and worse mosquitos everyone bitten to death nightmare
"October 11, 2020",4.0,Great for swimming,"Beautiful sheltered beach gorgeous for swimming but very crowded, no social distancing! Crystal clear water:)"
"October 11, 2020",5.0,Beautiful,Popped there for half a day on moped we hired. The beach is beautiful and gorgeous blue sea.. it was a shame that it was busy and we didn't get to sit on the beach due to socially distancing.. Went for a coffee overlooking the beach and the water was Crystal clear
"October 10, 2020",5.0,Best beach & location,"Pretty beach, well organised and clean with rental sun beds and plenty affordable activities for all ages. Lifeguard always present! Plenty of great local restaurant for lunch and dinners at affordable prices, boat trips available at far end of beach for those feeling adventurous."
"September 27, 2020",4.0,Nice place but too busy for us,"Its a lovely place but unfortunately it is also very popular, which means it is a very busy place(in normal times). There are boats that take you to view the caves, from the sea and a nice beach and some nice places to have a meal, We gave it a miss on this visit as we dont like to be where there are crowds of tourists but it is worth a visit if you dont mind the crowds"
"September 27, 2020",5.0,Nice and small beach,"Nice beach, which was allocated front of our apartment ! You can hire a paddle board or water bike. Its quite rocky, so ensure to have a shoes to the water with you."
"September 24, 2020",5.0,Hired a car and found this beautiful resort,We called in for lunch and and a much needed swim. Looks a beautiful resort and maybe next time we go to Corfu we will stay here . We stayed in sidari it was our first visit to Corfu and we are already looking to come back next may with friends
"September 21, 2020",5.0,Paradise,"We drove around the whole island and this was the most beautiful beach. I almost didn't want to write a review so it can stay a secret but honestly everyone should see paradise! White cliffs, bright green forest, turquoise water, caves to swim into, a lifeguard keeping a close eye,lovely restaurants, a short hike to a monastery. It truly is paradise. Loads of boat rentals around if you want to explore private beaches on accessible by boat. My holiday highlight for sure."
"September 19, 2020",5.0,Stunning,What a beautiful place. Scenery is breathtaking. Great snorkelling and beach.  Worth a visit of in Corfu.
"September 18, 2020",5.0,Beautiful beach,"Our villa was located up in the North East of the island but my partner and I took the hour car journey to this gorgeous place. We did a lot of Googling to find a sandy beach as a lot of those in Corfu are full of pebbles and decided we'd try Paleokastrita - great choice. It's understandably busy but so lovely, the sea is so clear and a pleasure to swim in amongst all the tiny fish. Definitely recommend. Plenty of snack bars, shops and restaurants to keep you going throughout the day too."
"September 18, 2020",5.0,SIMPLY STUNNING SCENERY,I couldn't be happier. Park me here for a week and come back 7 days later. Beautiful scenery and good facilities near for food and drinks etc.
"September 17, 2020",5.0,Great little hidden gem,"What a beautiful little bay! We had lunch overlooking the sea which was delicious! Be sure to do the boat trip to the caves, beautiful views and such clear water. Highly recommend"
"September 16, 2020",5.0,Stunning views and pedal boats!,"We took the 9A bus from just outside of Corfu town to the beach. It was 2.30 euro one way, taking just under an hour. Be careful the times aren‚Äôt very regular, maybe one an hour. Took us directly to the beach, which was a little small but no problem getting a space. The views are stunning, you could look at it all day! Two beds and a parasol cost 12 euro for the full day. Beach is primarily sandy but a few rocks here and there. A couple of places to eat but we didn‚Äôt try any, except a ice cream shop before we went, yum! There are some small shops for drinks and snacks too. No public toilet as far as we were aware, just the restaurant ones. Little signal so be prepared for no internet! There were also some pedal boats to rent, which were about 10 euro for an hour. It was pretty windy when we went but still very fun. Had a great day, definitely worth the trip!!"
"September 12, 2020",5.0,Lovely place,Absolutely gorgeous. Lovely white sand and clear blue waters. Lots of little bars and restaurants. Lovely walk up your the Monastry where you can buy some Kumquat Liquer.
"September 11, 2020",5.0,Beautiful beach day out,"Lovely beach, small but has everything you need. Beach bars and water sports. Sun beds around ‚Ç¨10-15 depending on location but well worth a visit."
"September 11, 2020",4.0,Beautiful,Lovely sat at the apollon having drink with a beautiful view sea is crystal clear. Lovely boats trips for only 10 euros.
"September 10, 2020",5.0,Fine beach with amenities nearby.,"We visited toward the end of the season, so we didn't experience any unpleasantly large crowds. Our visit was very relaxing, weather was excellent, food was great. The bees were out when we were outside mid-day, but they didn't bother us too badly. We had a great Airbnb with a patio looking over the bay. We have thought of this place often, and hope to return."
"September 10, 2020",5.0,Very busy,"Beautiful beach but a bit too busy for my liking. There's everything you need there, shops restaurants and boat hire etc. Not too expensive either"
"September 2, 2020",3.0,Sooo crowded even during covid,We've been here for just a moment. Even during covid the beach was extremely crowded and not very big. The view and the sea is beautiful but there are nicer beaches just around the corner.
"September 1, 2020",5.0,Gorgeous views from Belvedere restaurant,"Stunning bay views from this restaurant Food good & restaurant clean. We had saganaki mushroom, which was delicious üòã"
"September 1, 2020",1.0,Disappointed,"Rocks and small. Only for departing boats. Go somewhere else if possible, every other beach is nicer."
"September 1, 2020",4.0,Great beach but busy,Very nice beach but pretty busy. There is the public beach and private beaches too. Both are easy to access.
"August 30, 2020",5.0,Beautiful place and so glad we did a boat trip from here,"Was recommended by a local to visit. While parking the car at the top of the beach we saw a shop selling boat trips. Only one family allowed per boat, captain wore a mask and was a real gentleman. We had a great lunch with a fantastic view where the trip starts from first then enjoyed the trip around the caves and spend a lovely 90 mins on the more remote beach swimming and snorkelling. (We could choice our return time but no amenities there.) This beach i am reviewing however was also very pretty (but only saw from our restaurant in the end due to the lure of the boat trips)"
"August 29, 2020",5.0,Best beaches of Corf√π,"Maybe the best beaches of Corf√π are all around Paleokastritsa, so it is very nice to take a boat and reach them."
"August 25, 2020",1.0,PALEO CAR RENTALS,"This is not a review of the beach but to warn you not to hire a car with Paleo Car Rentals - go to an official company with a good reputation. My friend and I had an awful experience here. The man running the place was as nice and friendly as could be until we came to return the car. Due to the condition of the roads in Corfu we did scratch the car and fully admitted to this and offered to pay for the damage. Despite this the man became increasingly confrontational and aggressive. He argued that he had arranged for another customer to pick the car up on the same day and now this wouldn‚Äôt be possible. We asked him why as the damage was only surface level, and he started shouting and pointing in our faces! He said he had given us his best car (not what we had requested) and that we should have only driven it on main roads (of which there is only one in Corfu). The car was a 20 year old Nissan Micra that had already seen better days so this didn‚Äôt really ring true. He then took my friend on a moped to a separate location and demanded she pay ‚Ç¨300 for the damage, which is probably all that the car is worth. To be honest, whilst this is clearly an absolute rip off, if it‚Äôs in the contract then fine. My biggest issue was the aggressive manner in which he spoke with us and his inability to conduct a reasonable conversation, or to provide an explanation for the cost of the damages. Hiring a car is a good way to explore Corfu but just bear in mind that the roads are not in the best condition, and find a company with a better reputation!"
"August 21, 2020",5.0,Casual lunch,Great service Great food Outstanding natural beauty and scenery Would return again Family and couples friendly
"August 17, 2020",5.0,Very pretty view from the beach,"Beautiful beach, amazing views. Understandably busy.  Quite a pebbley beach though and some aggressive lil fish that bit us (cover up any wounds!) but still definitely worth the trip whilst you're in Corfu!"
"August 17, 2020",5.0,Ski Club 105,"We tried several boat trips in the area, however none of the trips were as good as this one. We were being shown every single beach and cave in the area, with heartwarming explanations and jaw-dropping information. Our skipper Angelo, was very friendly and we felt very safe. We will be back. Thank you for that special day. You made it one to remember."
"August 16, 2020",5.0,very nice beach with smaragd water,"a very small but also very nice beach. A bit stony, but with cristal clear water and a very nice senery left and right. Perfekt for snorkeling. Also nice restaurants to the left (we were at the last, ""Burger Corner"" or so, which was really delicious)"
"August 16, 2020",5.0,take the ride from corfou and go here!,You should not miss this part of the island. It je Calm hilly and filled with magnificant views. I recommand it
"August 13, 2020",5.0,OMG,"Omg this is a paradise ? Or what ? Mamma mia fantastic place , fantastic view and they are very organised I really love this place"
"August 12, 2020",5.0,Stunning,"Stunning beach and clear blue waters, lots of restaurants fairly priced, great day out would highly recommend"
"August 7, 2020",5.0,Beautiful location,"Fantastic beach, great for some shallow water snorkelling and kayaking. Advise to get here early. The car park is free but fills up very quickly."
"August 7, 2020",4.0,ok beach,beach has nice cliffs around but is a bit small and the boats coming here and out do not make the stay present. good if you are staying in akrotiki hotel as it is super close.
"August 5, 2020",3.0,Nice View and beach,Quite ok but not the nicest beach for me on Corfu. Beats however 90% of all other beaches so when you have a blind spot in your holiday schedule pay a visit.
"August 2, 2020",5.0,"Shockingly cold, extremely beautiful beach!","Very cold and deep waters, only for courageous swimmers... The view is wonderful, the place is astonishing!! Among the rocks, the view is breath-taking! After swimming, we rent a boat and we went to some caves with a captain that explained everything to us, for 10E per person. Strongly suggest it!"
"August 2, 2020",4.0,"Nice beach, cold water",We are staying in Kalami and headed here for a sandy beach. Sand is coarse bordering on gravelly stones but still good.  Cant do anything about it but the water must be 5 degrees colder than it is on the east coast of the island. Fresh! Caves to swim to or float to. Feels quite unspoilt.
"July 30, 2020",5.0,Relaxing,"We spent a few days in July in the village, all three beaches are super nice with a crystalline clear water, not all are sandy though but good for kids and they have plenty of activities and cafes The village is central and easy to access from the airport and all other beaches in the island by car (we didn‚Äôt try the public transportation)"
"July 29, 2020",1.0,Worst quality and experience for renting a boat,"We tried to rent a boat and most of the rental offices asked ridiculous prices even though the renting was for h13 to h18 requesting 150 euros! We even tried a bargain on the spot but it was not worth the hassle since most boats are old and the renters take advantage of the large number of tourists in Paleokastritsa. Go to a different beach to rent a boat, the smaller and remote beach the better."
"July 27, 2020",4.0,Corfu,Very cold water. Beach has rocks if you want to climb it. Vrachos restaurant is delicious if you want food.
"July 27, 2020",5.0,Wonderfull view,"What a wonderful beach, water amazing, if you are on Corfu you just can't miss this place! Recommend this so far"
"July 22, 2020",4.0,For Greek standard a good beach,As all beaches in Greek are mainly covered with rocks this beach isn t any different. The up site of this beach is that they offer good sunbeds (payed) and there are two restaurants on sight. Also u can rent boats and there is a scuba dive school. Enough to do and see for a week or so.
"February 27, 2020",5.0,Summer,Amazing view.the sea is fantastic.the beach is clean.for me its the most beautiful beach in corfu.i will come back there
"February 22, 2020",3.0,It's ok...,"Nice beach, cold and clear water. Too much people on a small place. Good for snorkeling. Looks better on pictures then live. It is best to rent a pedal boat and distance from the crowd or take a ride to nearby cave.."
"January 7, 2020",2.0,Cold and crowded,Could be beautiful....but just seriously packed. The beach is small and everyone is on it.... we had to wait 20 minutes to find a small space. Parking is a nightmare - with one small car park for the whole seafront.  The water is beautiful and clear - but really really cold - it must be the currant. As we couldn't swim - too cold- we took a pedal boat (only 10 euros) - but nearly got blown out to sea !  My husband and kids hated it. I was pleased to see it this part of corfu- but 100% wouldn't go again.
"December 17, 2019",4.0,"Paleokastritsa caves of Corfu, Greece","This was an excursion we chose from our cruise. The turquoise colored water was remarkable, along with blue-colored fish. The boat took us just inside a variety of cliff side caves where we could see a variety of rock formation and color. The entire trip was about 45 minutes. It was a unique opportunity to observe natural beauty.From there we went up to a higher elevation overlooking Paleokastritsa where we were able to enjoy the view while having snacks and beverages. This excursion concluded with a stop at Corfu town. We would have liked spending more time there, perhaps taking one of their carriage rides."
"November 13, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Place!,"Quiet beach when we were there, though it was shoulder/off season. Actually 2 beaches, across the parking lot from each other, one more protected than the other."
"November 8, 2019",4.0,nice spot...,"With some great views.....not crowded in October, and a bit cool for swimming, but nice to see the clear water"
"November 7, 2019",4.0,Boat trip to caves,"This was an excursion from a cruise ship. The boat trip from the beach was busy , each boat takes about 10/12 people, the caves are not very big, but on a very hot day it is a nice way to spend about an hour. The toilets are situated in the taverna next to the beach and they can be very busy."
"November 7, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Scenery,This is a very beautiful place with magnificent scenery. The beach is very nice with lovely sand but can get busy at the height of season. I have dived of the cliffs here at the very aptly names Acapulco bar.
"November 3, 2019",4.0,Lovely little bay,"Stayed in Gouvia but got the 20 minute bus to Paleokastritsa a few times as the beach was lovely and Sandy. Nice restaraunts around the bay. Not far to the monastery and an aquarium there too. If I came back to Corfu I‚Äôd stay in Paleo as it‚Äôs very pretty, good bus routes to visit out of the town. Swam right out around the coves and felt safe as the water is calm and warm. Lots of lovely taverns around the area and staff friendly in the shops."
"October 28, 2019",5.0,Really beautiful beach and bay,"Plenty of free parking here, at least when we visited in late October. The weather was fantastic, so it was quite busy with coach tour drop offs and independent visitors. There were a couple of changing cabins on the beach, a nice facility, as well as a free shower. There are several beaches facing different directions. Walk up the hill towards the monastery for a superb view of the beach and bay. Plenty of places to each, from restaurants to take-away snack bars. Splash-cat and canoe hire available, as well as boat tours of the caves and coast."
"October 25, 2019",5.0,We loved this beach,"This little slice of the world is absolutely gorgeous! The water is very clean and clear, it‚Äôs amazingly peaceful here. Around the area there are many lovely local places to eat and drink."
"October 22, 2019",4.0,great in October,"In October, this beach is not really crowded anymore, but I can imagine that in Summer it must be totally overcrowded. The beach was nice and calm. It was definitively beautiful to see, but the beaches are small. I also liked the view from the monastery onto the beaches. Just beautiful!"
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Beautiful blue sea,"Lovely place to sit and chill and watch the world go by , just down from the monastery very clean with beautiful blue sea"
"October 20, 2019",4.0,Nice bays,"Two or three nice bays and beaches, all with little boats for day trips or visits to the caves which are lovely."
"October 20, 2019",3.0,Could use some work,The beach is fairly small and as with much of Corfu it is a little dirty. There was a fair amount of trash on the beach which I found distracting. We also went to the nearby restaurant and gift shop and they really wanted everything done with cash to avoid the taxes. The water at the beach is a beautiful color of blue and good for swimming. Could be a great place if they could just clean it up a bit.
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Wonderful suntrap in most beautiful of locations,"We were recommended to include this village in our tour of Corfu as a ""must do"" and felt that sound advice. it is stunningly located with the deepest tourqoise blue seas and wooded cliffs. Part of it has fairly narrow beaches as located not from the main hotels, but if you travel past that a little to where the visiting coaches park up you will see signs for the ""main beach"" and this is just spectacular. The beach is soft sand, with a gradual slope into the sea. Nestled between two promontories it is kept largely wind free and so particularly warm. The sea was wonderfully warm to swim in and there is a wide variety of water activities on offer for pretty cheap prices such as a variety of pedalows, canoes (1 or 2 person) and open boat tours of local sea caves. There is also a wide selection of adjacent restaurants, shops and has changing and shower areas which are free just off the beach too. I can imagine that in season it gets manic but when we were there the crowds were perfectly manageable. Spent a great day there, so went a second time. considering basing our next Corfu holiday in this area"
"October 17, 2019",4.0,Nice place,Wonderfull place to stop and take a swim or even a boat trip plenty diffrent boats offers you can pick from lovely little local people runing cafes here two spent couple of hours here great fun
"October 17, 2019",5.0,"Clear, Cool Water.","This area of Corfu is a tourist trap. Be aware of that fact. I always go early season, late season or completely off season.The coastline itself is staggeringly beautiful. The waters have incredible colours and there is so much to explore. I took one of the regular boat trips out around the bays to explore the caves. They depart very regularly every day throughout the tourist season and cost ‚Ç¨10 per person. The ferrymen are all very friendly and helpful. They also have a good sense of humour. The whole trip took an hour and was very good value for money. The caves are worth seeing, particularly on a sunny and calm day. There are photo opportunities all the way. (Make sure you sit on one side or the other - not in the middle) Elsewhere, and within easy walking distance, are diving schools, sandy or pebble beaches, the monastery and Corfu Aquarium. There are a variety of tavernas and cafes at a broad range of prices. What we have tried over the years have always been of a good standard although some establishments are a little expensive for Corfu. Just beware of the tourists arriving by coach, taxi and mini bus. It can get very busy. Also, parking can be a problem in peak season. The main car park is also where the coaches pull in. Spaces in July and August will be at a premium. It is free."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,One of the most beautiful beaches in Europe,"A very nice beach, mountains and forest get close to the beach line. Variety of small beaches each one unique. It is worth to take a boat or a skipper with a boat and travel between the various beaches."
"October 14, 2019",3.0,"AGIOS SPIRIDON BEACH, crowded","crowded, crowded, crowded, dirty water, seagrass, too small beach for sucha tusristic ""invasion"", the only big plus of this beach is the BEAUTIFUL SCENE and THE BAY."
"October 13, 2019",3.0,Beautiful to see,"Drove here from Corfu Town. Views were unmatched, ate at the harbor, the beach area was pretty crowded, parking is difficult."
"October 13, 2019",3.0,short visit but not impressed,"We visited the beach here as part of a coach tour, and so only had 3 hours but felt that we were ready to go well before the time ran out. There are two beaches and I have to say they weren't the best. There are boat tours from the one beach which we didn't do and an aquarium which we have done previously and was OK but not exceptional. My wife did go swimming and did enjoy that. There are restaurants and snack bars which seemed OK - we only had ice creams and drinks so cant comment further on the quality of these. The walk between the two harbours was dirty and litter strewn, hardly inspiring. The views from Bella Vista are stunning but the actual beaches themselves left us unmoved."
"October 13, 2019",5.0,Stunning,Only visited for couple of hours and lunch but this place is absolutely stunning would love to stay rhere. Also went up to the Bella Vista what a view! The bay and beaches are what dreams are made of
"October 13, 2019",1.0,The destructive impact of mass tourism on a former paradise,"Reading Prospero's Cell or other vintage stories of this bay, you can imagine what was once a paradise of purest water, bounteous marine life, tranquility and beauty. What you see today is massive traffic, potholed roads never built to support long lines of tour buses every day, store after store of identical Chinese-made souvenirs, crowds of tourists (even in early fall) that rival New York's Penn Station or London's Paddington Station, beaches that smell like suntan lotion and water churned and polluted over years leaving little of the marine life that once could be found. Everyone going to Corfu has heard of this place. But what they've heard about no longer exists and all the sadder for what once must have been a place of extraordinary beauty. Go if you want to party with other Anglophone tourists and drink beer. Otherwise, you'll be doing the environment a favor to stay away."
"October 13, 2019",5.0,"Beautiful, but small",It ws very crowded even in october - almost no free space on the sands. Free parking and a lot of shops and tavernas nearby.
"October 11, 2019",3.0,Beach town,A typical beach town in Corfu just a bit bigger. Plenary of resturants and even a yellow submarine or rather a boat for a sea outing.
"October 10, 2019",5.0,Lots going on here,"There are several beaches to choose from within a very compact area, just park and have a wander round to see which you like best. There are the usual shops/stalls to but your giant inflatable flamingo etc. and plenty of cafes, restaurants, bars and tavernas to make sure you‚Äôre never having to queue. Pedaloes, small boats etc. For hire and boattrips round the bay for those who want to get the sea breeze. Some beaches are tucked away, down steps but these can belong to restaurants and having enticed you down, then ply their services - there are more beaches that are easier to access and free. You may want the relative quiet of one of the more private beaches obvs. Parking is right at the end of the road so don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt squeeze in to one of the roadsides, there is a proper car park further on. This area does tend to be very busy but the atmosphere is all holiday with families setting up for the day and many people dropping in for a dip in the crystal clear turquoise water. It is quite clean considering the number of people too."
"October 9, 2019",4.0,Good,"Not a very big beach but very beautiful. We paid for sunbeds in the one restaurant that offer sunbeds, but it was a little far from the beach. It was fun to swim because there were no waves when we were there. Overall very nice"
"October 9, 2019",4.0,"Very nice beach, restaurants nearby","The beach is relatively small, but I really had a good time, water is clean, blue and warm, people are amazing, good restaurants very close, prices are OK."

"September 30, 2019",5.0,Fabulous,Beautiful in every way plenty parking space lovely cafes can't fault it went up to monastery you can walk if you're fit enough or take car parking space is available at top well worth a visit
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Must visit,"Amazing beaches, but topping it with a boat tour. rent one and let half a day for hopping from beach to beach/small bays. Pack some lunch and lots of drinks. Beware of alchohol consumption , harbour police runs randomal checks."
"September 28, 2019",4.0,Beautiful,What a place. Quite busy but beautiful. Beach is lovely and plenty of boat trips to neighbouring beaches and caves. Bit of a walk to the yellow monastery but worth the hike for the view. Takes about 30mins from Kontokali and you buy your ticket on the bus. Number 9A.The corner bar offeres great homemade meals and local draft beer. It's about a 20 minute walk (we are quite fit) to the famous Le Grotta bar.
"September 27, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Beach,We have spent the last 10 days in paleo with this beautiful beach as our main go to the ocean. It is so amazing the colours of the ocean and sea life are just incredible. We loved spending time here. For us the main issue with this beach is the amount of rubbish left by other people it is littered with cigarette butts and other items it really is a crying shame that peps don‚Äôt take their rubbish away with them!! That being said there are few bins across the beach so this could defo be addressed by the locals. That being said it remains awesome and defo worth spending time here. üòÉ
"September 26, 2019",5.0,Sandy,Nice sandy beach and the bay is quite calm as well for water activities like snorkeling or canoeing. Very clear water. They do boat tours from the bay or you can take a taxi boat to more secluded beaches. Have quite few restaurants around. Good prices for canoe boats or pedal boats.
"September 25, 2019",1.0,Yuck,"Extremely dirty , rubbish everywhere , disrespectful tourists littering anywhere possible , the beach amenities are left to the 80s , so are the shops around with extremely rude shop owners , the natural scenery is AMAZING and it‚Äôs a pity that it‚Äôs being destroyed in the name of money . Would never go back ."
"September 25, 2019",5.0,Just stunning,"This is one of the prettiest beaches, small like a cove so I‚Äôd imagine in the summer season very busy. It was quieter in sept so I could appreciate it‚Äôs beauty. Lots of free parking too. Then you can either walk up the hill to the monastery or there is parking up there on 2 levels."
"September 25, 2019",5.0,Gorgeous beach,One of the most beautiful areas I‚Äôve ever been to... check out paradise beach and all the small caves... amazing üòâ
"September 25, 2019",5.0,Coach trip with TUI,A must visit beautiful bays and boat trip with lovely Greek restaurants.The boat trip is a must in the crystal clear sea and see the blue eyed fish
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place,"Very pretty place, very green with the beautiful turquoise sea Greece is known for. Very busy place, the beaches were all packed but then it was August! Plenty of places to eat and drink. One word of warning the sea is really cold here due to the cold water springs in the sea bed. I thought my children were joking when they said it felt like Cornish water at Easter!!"
"September 23, 2019",2.0,Disappointed,"We went there on the first day of our vacation as it was the most advertised beach of the island. Proved to be a disappointment, it is narrow, short, crowded, without basic amenities such as a toilet, the parking is right behind and large couches swirm all day. The water is rather cold, so beware for the kids. Very nice scenery, as in the photos, but frankly would have been best just to drive through the area, enjoy sightseeing through all of the little beaches of the area and move along. We found during the next days a lot of other amazing beaches"
"September 23, 2019",3.0,Busy resort,"First went here about 13 years ago, wasn't particularly overwhelmed with it then. Despite what tour operators say this is NOT village, it is spread out over two miles. Went back this week whilst staying in San Stefanos. Paleokastristra now very busy, cars lining both sides of the roads and worst of all take away food outlets. Definitely would not go back. But it has to be said the coast line and views are magnificent."
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Views of the Beach Below and Above,"One of the prettiest places in all of Corfu is that of Paleokastritsa and the beach area. We first went to the beach and it was only a photo stop but it made for great pictures in both directions. We then drove to the top by bus for magnificent views of the beach and the sea. Interesting trip by bus as well, very narrow traverse of the town. Tour busses were not in their original street planning because it is very tight."
"September 22, 2019",3.0,Very crowded,"The beach itself was incredibly crowded and didn‚Äôt live up to expectations. If you want a nice, relaxed beach day then the definitely isn‚Äôt the place to go. We took a walk and the route was quiet and the views were gorgeous - this was definitely the best part of the day and if you come here I highly recommend exploring rather than staying on the crowded beach."
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Best water,"Best water at this beach. It was so clear all the way out.  You can easily see the bottom.  Plenty of things to do and eat.  However, eating is expense here so expect to burn a hole in your wallet/purse.  Great beach though...One of the best."
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Paleokastritsa,"Lovely sandy beach good beach bars and lots of water sports.Go up to the Monastery, the view's are stunning"
"September 21, 2019",5.0,Beautiful setting!,"Well worth the drive or bus ride from Corfu Town, Paleokastritsa Beach is a gem, whether you are looking for a swim, a boat ride, a tour of the seaside caves, or just a meal in a gorgeous setting. The climb to the monastery might seem daunting to some, but is really not a chore, and well worth the time and effort."
"September 19, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place one of the best on Corfu,"Had a day trip here while staying in Sidari, Beautiful area to visit very picturesque, but a little busy while we were there. The scenery on the way there and while we were there is breathtaking. Especially up on the Bella Vista. Plenty of places to go for a spot of lunch or a drink."
"September 19, 2019",4.0,beautiful beach,"On the way to the church you go past the beach, the water is calm and clean, safe for everyone who visits a must stopping place"
"September 18, 2019",3.0,only really sandy beach in paleo,"on the plus side this is probably the only really sandy beach in paleo. however on the downside it gets very busy. best time to go is for a couple of hours from about 10 till 12, before it gets really crowded. there are more secluded beaches to choose from in the area although most are pebbles."
"September 18, 2019",3.0,Nice but a bit on the busy side,We got there nice and early so got a good spot but it soon got busy. Would recommend getting there early before the coach‚Äôs come in too town
"September 18, 2019",4.0,Beautiful bays,Beautiful place to visit. Actual beach was relatively small but several tavernas around. Sheltered and calm. Lots of boat trips going out taking visitors to other small bays and on tours.
"September 17, 2019",5.0,beautiful beach and people,Caught a boat around the caves. Beautiful with lots to see too. Absoluately brilliant value for money
"September 17, 2019",5.0,"Sand and stone, just in 200 m","Place you can be on both - sand and stone beaches, just in 200 m distance. Water was really clear and warm. We loved it. and in addition - one of rare beaches we found the dressing cabins in public use."
"September 16, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Such a beautiful beach,the sea is crystal clear. From the harbour take a boat trip to see the blue caves, it's a fabulous trip lasting around half an hour, well worth visiting"
