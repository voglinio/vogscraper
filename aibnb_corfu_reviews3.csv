32306522,Anna September 2022 A lovely lovely villa situated in peaceful Kerkira. Ideal location if you don’t want to be around a bunch of tourist  very close to beach and amazing local mom and pop restaurants. What a charming town and beautiful and very clean villa. Alexia and Jade who are the Villa managers are so kind and helpful.  Would love to visit again and stay at MaisonRose!
32306522,Chip July 2022 Emmanuel - your Home is spectacular! Thank you for putting on Airbnb!!
32306522,Maximilian June 2022 The villa is a dream  and even more impressive in person. The on site staff is wonderful - Jade  Ricardo and Alexis were all very kind  welcoming  and always ready to assist with any questions. On the arrival day  there was some confusion with the owner regarding the usage of the chalet. It was included in the listing  but then we received a call that we should have asked to use it. That was cleared up quickly however  and we absolutely loved our experience - we’ll be back again some day and recommend you book this now.
32306522,Rhonda August 2021 Maison Rose is spectacular!The house  the location  the grounds  the view and the staff are all amazing! Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay relaxing in the beauty and the peace of the villa and spending most of our time at the house because we didn’t want to leave. Everything was thought of and the amenities are very high quality. The nearby beaches and the village are all authentic and not touristy. We really appreciated being able to stay at Maison Rose and hope to come back again! Highly recommend! Response from Emmanuel August 2021 Thank you so much Rhonda! It has been a pleasure to receive you and we really hope to do it soon again!
32306522,Pete July 2021 Beautiful property  in fact far better than the pictures suggest. Despite being modern it has real character  you get the impression it’s a labour of love . Pool area is so relaxing with excellent views. The gardens are well tended and the whole place feels extremely secure behind locked gates. Angellica’s communication is excellent and Alexia’s daily donuts and croissants a nice treat. A walk from several excellent tavernas and the beach. We’ll be back. Highly recommend!!
32306522,Amed July 2021 No ensuite toilets  otherwise beautiful!
32306522,"Anja May 2021 ""Maison Rose"" is the most beautiful house we ever stayed in. Especially the pool are with the marvelous view to the beach and the lovely living room were really great. All the furniture and every detail is extremely tasteful and Agelikki who helped us find our way around was like an angel when she appears. We could recommend this house 100 % and you will have a very peaceful and unforgettable holiday there! Response from Emmanuel May 2021 Thank you so much Anja! We will be glad to receive you any time!  Have a good trip back.  Emmanuel Show more"
32306522,Lucy November 2020 The villa is beautiful  even better than the pictures. There is a wonderful view from the pool and stylish interior with classic pieces.  It has everything you need and all the appliances are top range. There is a wine fridge to enjoy great wine  better than what you will find in the local shops  and we cooked most nights.  Emmanuel was always quick to respond and gave great tips.  Local area included plenty of beautiful beaches and coves. The nearest beach is only a short walk down the hill but I would definitely recommend a car to discover the local area.  I would 100% recommend the house to anyone looking for a stylish and relaxing getaway.
32306522,Anna August 2020 We stayed in Maison Rose for a week. Surrounded by lush Mediterranean vegetation and overlooking the sea  we spent many undisturbed hours reading in the garden or at the pool.... Its privileged location allowed us to quickly drive down to the beach for a sundowner or to the nearby charming pelekas for a backed feta with veggies (my just discovered favorite one).  We did a couple of daily trips and Angela  the lady in charge of the property  always came up with good suggestions (and fresh croissants in the morning!) and helped us with the bookings. Response from Emmanuel August 2020 Thanks a lot Anna. It has been a great pleasure to have you in MaisonRose. This encourages us in bringing each year some improvements to the villa. Kind regards   Emmanuel Show more
32306522,Spiro July 2019 Our visit to Villa Maison Rose was one of life’s spectacular experiences. Maison Rose belongs in AirBNB’s Plus category. We were very lucky to be among her 1st guests of the season and truly felt like we had walked onto a movie set. The Villa is meticulously designed  every amenity has been thought through and acquired for our comfort. Our hosts  Isabel and Emmanuel who are great communicators  have created a true relaxing hidden paradise that is moments away from the beach. Our house manager Aggeliki takes her role as house manager to a whole new level. She was knowledgeable  professional  courteous and has a true love for the villa and her island. She was very keen to make sure our stay a most memorable one and succeeded in every way possible. Our hope is to return to this magical villa and share it again and often with friends If your dates are available  book it! This is one of those villas that won't be available often due to all of the repeat guests once the secret is out. Response from Emmanuel August 2019 Thank you so much Spiro! Aggeliki appreciated you a lot and we will be happy to receive you next year. You were our first guests  and excellent ones !
30120295,Debra September 2022 We truly loved staying at this beautiful country home in the charming village of Pelekas—by far our favorite of the four we stayed at during our two week Greece holiday (and perhaps of all our Airbnb stays both domestically and internationally!). The house was immaculate  updated  tastefully appointed and comfortable. We enjoyed coffee (the best we’ve had) and delicious fruit  toast and honey gifts on the veranda overlooking the fantastic view every morning. Our generous host was very accessible—sending links to less populous beaches and favorite restaurants when asked. Despite occasional parking challenges  we would absolutely return again without hesitation!
30120295,Jonathan August 2022 This place was fantastic! Lots of space  great location in the village  very luxury minded. The hose was exceptional  and I couldn’t say enough good! Prompt and more than willing to make any accommodations needed! Thanks again!!!

30120295,Clara August 2021 The house is located just in the center of the town  walking distance from some cafes  little restaurants and a small supermarket. The house has fantastic views. It is fully equiped  we didn't miss anything. Regarding arrival and directions  it was quite easy since Giorgios assisted us with everything. He gave us a very warm welcome and he left some bread  ham  cheese  fruits and a bottle of wine  which we really appreciated. We were very confortable.
30120295,Patrick July 2021 Dear Airbnb Community   This accommodation is truely a nice place to stay when travelling to Corfu.

We can only recommand to choose this flat  all the little attention  the decoration  and the terrasse  make it a perfect stay for your holidays in Corfu. We could communicate easily with the host  and we could move our days without any trouble after missing our flight! (Thanks again for your kindness) We will never forget the amazing red sunrise above the island sitting on the terrasse. We dont think We will ever get the chance to see something similar. We felt blessed. Thanks again!

30120295,Daniel September 2020 The accommodation is amazing; clean; strong beds; beautiful view from the balcony and the place is cosy. Perfect for friends and families  it has a high-end finish and the luxury you would want especially being away from home. We were blown away with everything; from the welcome to the small things  especially in the kitchen. Everything you can ask for was there. We could not ask for a better host  communication was superb; Jorge arrived at the property at the agreed time and was there on time. The welcome we received was amazing  we were shown around the property and the photos looks just how it is in real life. We honestly want to thank you for how you treated us and the attention to detail that was put into the accommodation; we are definitely planning to return again in the near possible future!!!
30120295,Sarah October 2019 Amazing   what a find . this house has recently been renovated and every detail has been planned with luxury and homeliness in mind . Georgio met us and saw us off   he could not be more helpful - he gave us great tips on what else to do after our stay and was happy for us to call him anytime . The photos   whilst great   don’t really do the house justice - it is so well designed and decorated with the best of furniture and furnishings . On arrival we had wine   a large fruit bowl and all the water and snacks we needed for our stay . It has s beautiful outdoor area with stunning views . We brought our baby and the cot supplied was perfect   really sweetly finished with some avail baby towels - another nice touch . The restaurants are all within 5 minutes walk - when we stay again I think we will cook in more as the kitchen is so well furnished . The beach is about 25 minutes walk but there is a shuttle bus - otherwise you can drive down - lovely bars to sit whilst watching the waves   and it’s sandy unlike many other Corfu beaches .

30120295,Emilie September 2019 This was the best house we’ve had in all our years travelling. Not only was the house great  the host was great aswell. Thank you so much George! If we ever come back  you can be certain we come back here! (Also we love Corfu ;) )
30120295,Erica September 2019 This house is absolutely stunning inside and out. It is very spacious and has everything you might need. The outdoor terraces have a wonderful view and there is also a garden. George (Milena’s son) met us and was on hand for any queries we had via WhatsApp including local tips. On arrival there was water  coffee  fruit etc  general cooking supplies and  most importantly  a bottle of homemade olive oil from the family olive trees. Pelekas is a nice town with a variety of tavernas  cafes and shops (incl. a bakery). We would definitely come again. Great hosts and great house!
30120295,Arthur September 2019 Amazing house and experience. Every detail is thought upon. Terrific view from the balcony. Great location. Right in the center of the village. 5 min driving to the beach. Exceptionally clean and functional space. Very cozy and delightful.
30120295,Adrien August 2019 The house was very clean  comfortable with everything you need. We felt like home.  We enjoyed the terrace a lot  the view and the atmosphere are amazing.  A typical Greek village which is very charming.  George was more than welcoming and gave us good recommendations for our visits and restaurants.  We definitely recommand Melinda’s beautiful house.  One of the best Airbnb I’ve been to  and I’ve been to quite a lot! Go for it!
30120295,Nigel July 2019 The accomodation was perfect for us (five adults). With two fully equipped bathrooms and three bedrooms we had all the facilities and privacy we needed. The whole house is built to a high standard  so it felt luxurious. The view is amazing - superb to gaze at while eating breakfast. The host is very accomodating and welcoming. If we needed help or guidance  he was eager to provide it  with a smile.
30120295,Andrei June 2019 Amazing place that lets you experience authentic Pelekas village. Incredible view from the terrace. Very tastefully decorated apartment combining new with restored antique objects and pieces of furniture.
30120295,Karen April 2019 The place was AMAZING!! Will definitely go again  and recommend it to everyone. Hosts were wonderful.
30120295,Patricia April 2019 I recently spent almost a week at Milenas Country House  along with three others. This is located in a real Greek village close to the main beaches of the west coast and only 10kms from Corfu. Everything about the house was excellent. It is extremely comfortable and well equipped. Everything has been done with great care and attention to detail. The view over mountains and far off sea is spectacular  and the garden is full of flowers. and trees. Apart from this  one of the nicest things was the hospitality from Milena and George. George met us at the airport to make sure we found the way. Milena made us a large spinach pie. Go there and enjoy everything!

9656230,Iain October 2021 We stayed for four nights in October  right at the end of the season  two adults and two children. Vicky turned the heating on in the pool before we arrived  and we got a lot of use out of it. The villa is very clean and well appointed. Looks recently refurbished. Four pristine bathrooms and comfortable bedrooms. It’s very peaceful and not overlooked at all  feels private and relaxing. We spent one evening lying on the loungers on the roof watching the stars. Only twenty minutes from the airport. A short walk into Pelekas for the mini mart or tavernas. A short drive to three or four great beaches. The perfect place to stay. No reason not to come back. Thank you Vicky. Response from Vicky November 2021 Thank you so much Iain for your wonderful review. I'm so happy that you enjoyed your holiday and i hope to see you again. All the best!!!
9656230,Grace October 2021 Can't recommend this place highly enough! Vicky welcomed us into the beautiful villa and went out of her way to ensure our trip was perfect from beginning to end. The rooms and pool were outstanding  as were the sunset views from the rooftop. The village of Pelekas is filled with friendly tavernas where we enjoyed beautiful local food each night and also uncovered a gorgeous beach  it is also only a short drive from Corfu Town. We can't wait to come back someday!
9656230,Clare September 2021 Where to start?!!! Firstly… the villa… is beautiful… we had the most amazing time and the villa was perfect. Described and photographed accurately . There is plenty of space  all amenities and accessories that you would need. It is spotless and so well looked after and cared for! I cannot fault the villa at all!  Secondly.. Vicky… is the most wonderful and caring g host. Nothing is too much trouble. She is so thoughtful. We travelled with babies and throughout our stay she was offering and finding things to make us and the babies more comfortable. She is a fantastic host. Communication and local help and support is perfect.  Thirdly.. location.. a short and beautiful walk into Pelakas village where you will find everything you need.. plenty for restaurants  shops  a lovely bakery and mini markets… close to beautiful beaches both secluded and with bars etc..  We have just finished the most wonderful week at Vicky’s villa and we will most definitely visit again and recommend to anyone looking to visit to Corfu! Show more
9656230,India September 2021 When we found this last-minute villa on AirBnB  it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was even more perfect than it seemed online. Vicky is the most thoughtful  gracious host who made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived.  She provided us with all the information we needed including restaurant recommendations and showed us around. The villa is perfect! The kitchen has everything you would need. The bed/bathrooms are beautiful  clean and comfortable  and the outside areas are excellent. Location is great – walking distance from the beach and Pelekas Town. It could be worth hiring a car if you want to explore the island  but for us  the taxi service recommended by Vicky was perfect for exploring new beaches/areas.  Thank you Vicky for a wonderful week! We hope to come back in the future and will be sure to recommend to our friends and family. Response from Vicky September 2021 Thank you so much India. I hope to see you soon. All the best!!!
9656230,Tim August 2021 Absolutely loved our week long stay in this gorgeous villa. Short walk to Pelekas town with its restaurants and shops  and also to the two beaches with beach bars and water sports.  Cannot recommend Villa Pelekas highly enough  and Vicky is a great and considerate host
9656230,Chloe September 2019 Villa Pelekas is just lovely! And also just as stunning as it looks in the pictures. We managed to book this last minute due to other holiday accommodation letting us down and we were more than impressed. Vicky  the host  was so helpful and responsive from the minute we booked. The villa is immaculate and also in such a lovely location- Pelekas beach is only a 20 minute walk away and is a great beach which isn’t over priced or full of tourists. In Pelekas village you will find lovely tavernas with local cuisine and high quality food/ service. During our trip we were happy staying in and around Pelekas as it’s located in a beautiful part of Corfu. Although  if you are someone that enjoys exploring an island or goes out a lot  renting a car will make your life a little easier. We had no problems at Villa Pelekas and a truly enjoyable holiday - the only bad thing was that we had to leave! Thanks Vicky  we hope to see you soon:)
9656230,Greg August 2019 Wonderful villa. Great host. Memorable holiday! Response from Vicky August 2019 I'll be very pleased to see you soon.
9656230,Andrew August 2018 Viki is a great host with a super villa in a fabulous location. Despite arriving after midnight Viki was there to welcome us and ensure we knew where everything was and how it all works.  The villa is modern and lacks for nothing with thoughtful and elegant indoor and outdoor spaces and importantly for some of us in the heat of a Greek summer the Air Conditioning is excellent in all rooms. However what makes the Villa standout is the feeling of hospitality and homeliness right down to the slippers at the end of your bed  fresh eggs delivered each morning by Viki's Dad who looks after the pool and Nancy who comes in to clean twice a week.  The location is excellent for exploring North and West Corfu and we would recommend hiring a boat to view the dramatic coastline by sea  stopping at restaurants and Tavernas as you go then retiring back to the villa for the views and fabulous sunsets.  Enjoy xx Show more
9656230,Thomas August 2018 Lovely villa and perfect location! Response from Vicky August 2018 Thank you for coming at my villa. I hope you'll come again.

9656230,Michaela October 2017 Vicky is a truly wonderful host and it was a real pleasure to meet her. We will definitely be returning to Villa Pelekas. The house is so clean and comfortable and Vicky's hostessing skills are second to none. Nothing was too much trouble. Vicky went above and beyond a usual Airbnb experience. The house had beautiful views and was in a great location. Very safe for our children and the garden is well designed with an outdoor kitchen and various places to sit/lay to make the most of the sun. The most relaxing holiday we've ever had with 5 children. Thank you.
9656230,Steven September 2017 Exceeded our expectations! Villa Pelekas was perfect for our extended family  and Vicky was only too happy to accomodate any requests.

9656230,Malgorzata September 2017 Super luxury place  woderfull atmosphere  great hospitality and stunning view. Nice swimming pool- great for kids. Barbecue and lovely chillout place with a view towards the see  great for 2 families or 7-9 people. Fully equiped with anything you can think of is needed during holidays. Super clean with cleaning service every 2 days. We were served with fresh from the garden vegetables and eggs - super tasty😋. Close to amazing sandy beaches and great local food restaurants. Its exactly what we were looking for. Response from Vicky September 2017 Thank you so much for all. I hope to see you soon. Many regards!!!
9656230,Mato July 2017 Vicky was an incredibly warm and welcoming host and made sure that everything was taken care of. The villa is even more impressive in real life and feels like you are staying in someone’s residence and has a spectacular view on the sea. The location too could not be better – Glyfada beach is 5 minutes away  Corfu town 20 minutes; while the village of Pelekas is itself very pretty and worth visiting. We were exceptionally impressed with the care and attention given to the upkeep of the house  including making sure that the pool was crystal clean and the house tidy with fresh linens and towels. We were so happy to have found this place and will certainly return!
9656230,Ben June 2017 The villa was well equipped and kept very clean. It was also private but still had ocean views. Vicky was very helpful and answered all of the questions we had. Response from Vicky July 2017 Thank you for choosing my villa for your holiday. You are welcome to come again.

The host was very helpful and kind.  Access is via a narrow road  as everywhere along the coast. Be careful on the way to the beach on foot  the road is slippery.  Our stay was comfortable and nice. I would love to come back.
31658242,Lex August 2022 Very friendly people. Beautiful house with an amazing view. Would recommend this apartment to everyone that is good on their feet  because the way to the house is quite steep. We enjoyed our stay here very much!
31658242,Rosa July 2022 We had a lovely stay at lidovois place. Very clean and nice apartment. Clean sheets every 2/3 days. Location also great  but you do need to climb a bit. Would really recommend. Nice restaurants and a supermarket nearby.

Everything is in walking distance (beach  tavernas and supermarket) and you can enjoy your meal seeing and hearing beautiful Ionian Sea.

31658242,Marina July 2019 This was our second trip to Corfu and this time we were lucky to find this apartament. Stunnig view of the beach and sea will be the first thing you see when you go on the balcony. In 3 minutes you are on the Kontogialos beach. Clean and quiet studio was perfect for relaxing. By far  this was the best place we had stayed in  not just in Corfu but all over the Greece  and its not as close to be the most expensive.
31658242,Christopher October 2022 Very nice small accommodation with great sea views from the balcony. Has a small kitchen  two single beds and a bathroom  so everything you need.

31658242,Konstantin September 2022 The apartment is located in a house bias below the beautiful village of Peleka  which can boast quaint cafes  a few tavernas and a great bakery. Beach (with umbrella/sunbed rental) and supermarket are less than a five-minute walk away. The path up to the bus stop (30 minutes to Corfu town) and into the village is a bit strenuous due to the slope  but can also be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. (Otherwise  there is parking in front of the apartment for rental cars.) The room was very clean  equipped with everything you need  and the view of the sea from the small balcony speaks for itself anyway. All in all  the stay could not have been more pleasant. Translated from German  Show original
31658242,Valentina August 2022 Room with beautiful sea view  spacious and very clean  very well equipped with all the necessary utensils even in the kitchen! Beach and small market just minutes away.

We felt very comfortable there! Translated from German  Show original
31658242,Elke July 2022 The apartment building is located on the slope with beautiful views of the beach and sea. It is not far to the beach but the way back is quite steep.

31658242,Alfredo September 2021 The Lidovois are nice and friendly. The beach is a 2-minute walk (it takes 5 minutes to go back...). And the view is truly breathtaking! Car is a must  but you park in front of the house. Definitely recommend! Translated from Italian  Show original
27918942,Iryna July 2022 Beautiful house with garden see view terrase.Super host  polite and helpful.I felt me as I was at home)but next to the sea!Thanks a lot for everything)hope we will back next summer.
27918942,Dmitriy August 2021 Superb experience. The apartment and terrace are great  calm  nice view  beautiful garden. In real life  everything is the same or even better than in photos. Pelekas is an adorable small village with lots of cafes  taverns  and narrow streets(be sure to go out of the main road into small pedestrian streets). Good free parking. Theo is responsive and tolerate all my multiple questions :)

27918942,Alvar September 2022 The apartment is very well equipped and left nothing to be desired. Furthermore  it is in a great location and for longer excursions there is a scooter rental in Pelekas Town. Otherwise  everything is a 10-minute walk away for quick errands or for appetites. We look forward to seeing you soon! Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Jennifer May 2022 Fantastic accommodation  parking in front of the door  restaurants just a few meters away. It couldn't have been better. Theo is super nice and always available. We will be happy to come back!!! Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Luise October 2021 Really nice place and super relaxed  great landlords! An unforgettable view of the south-west coast of the island  a large garden resembles a green oasis. More beautiful than home :) Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Ricarda August 2021 Super dear family and a very nice complex with a great view. The apartment was very cozy and clean. We will be happy to come back :) Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Yinwei August 2022 Super accommodating host. Going above and beyond to make sure we had a smooth stay. Easily one of the best host I have come across on Airbnb!  Location of the house is superb  the house is charming with a patio that has a wonderful view of sunset.  Highly recommend 100%
13195049,Julien July 2022 Pelekas is a charming and lively little village with all amenities. The nearby beaches are very beautiful. The apartment is very well located and the terrace offers a magnificent view. A car is on the other hand essential but it is worth a little for all the island.
13195049,Philipp July 2022 Its a very nice and clean little Apartment with a wonderfull view ober the east of Corfu. I can really recomend this.
13195049,Thierry July 2022 comfortable flat  well located in the village.
13195049,Chris June 2022 Avgi and Theodore are absolute superhosts ! When we arrived  there were nice gifts waiting for us such as wine  candy  local delicacies  .... The house itself was everything we'd hoped for; clean  wonderful location  quiet and still lively (about a 1 minute walk from the town square ;-) )  and a roof terrace with a view that just has to be experienced to be believed... you can see both sides of the island  absolutely stunning and a joy to watch the sunrise while having breakfast. The location is superb  about 15 minutes from Kerkeya  10 minutes to the nearest beaches (both the popular Glyfada beach as well as the more quiet but beautiful Pelekas beach). I actually walked there as the roads are quite steep and can be challenging especially if you're afraid of heights. Our stay was generally pleasant and when there was a brief issue with the water supply  our hosts actually offered to use their showers if we wanted to.... absolutely top notch hospitality. I can easily recommend Avgi's house to anyone who wishes to experience Corfu in a relaxed and comfortable way!
13195049,Cherif May 2022 Everything in the accommodation was perfect. It had everything we need and was very clean. The view from the balcony was really nice but the location is a little bit far from the beach. The nearest beach was 30 min away by feet. Pelekas is located on a hill so be prepared to walk 200 meters down/up. We suggest to rent a car to reach locations easily. However if you are for the first time in Corfu (as we were) you may need to know that the roads are very narrow and damaged so driving will not be easy there.
13195049,Dana May 2022 We spent several days of our spring holiday in this very old  good renovate house in one of the narrow streats of Pelekas. The flat is unusual  romantic and good equipped. Breakfast on the terrace every day were unforgettable start of the day. The hosts are very attentive  they welcomed us with gifts  wine and some meals. Village Pelekas and surrounds nature are beautiful  we set out along the good mark paths (green and yellow).
13195049,Flo September 2021 The lil house is really cosy and the interior was made with an eye for a detail. The communication with the host was excellent. The location is amazing overlooking two sides of the sea. All in all would always come back there
13195049,Eva August 2021 We had an amazing time at this house! The terrace and its view is absolutely beautiful.
13195049,Guido July 2021 This place is truly a gem! Beautifully located in Pelekas  with an incredible and large terrace. The appartment is well equipped and close to the main square. The local shop owners (especially from the two bakeries next to each other) are incredibly friendly  given the waves of tourists that pass through this village. Pelekas is the perfect place to explore the nearby beaches  and it is so conveniently close to Corfu too! Last but not least  Avgi and Theodore have been great and helpful hosts  thank you!
13195049,Melanie July 2021 We stayed at avgis place for 5 days. The little town is very pretty and everyone was super friendly to us. The apartment itself is very clean and cozy  we enjoyed having breakfast on the balkony with a fantastic view everyday. The town also has a lot of restaurants which are all super delicious. We really enjoyed our stay and would absolutely come back
13195049,Florian June 2021 Really nice house located in a lovely village  with an incredible view across the island
13195049,Thomas September 2020 Had a great stay  very comfortable place  great location for exploring the island as well as for local amenities  and some of the best views of the island from the balcony. Would highly recommend
13195049,Damien September 2020 lovely apartment  with breathtaking view. we enjoyed our stay a lot. highly recommended.
13195049,Andreas August 2020 Renovated traditional village house with nice artistic touches in keeping with the old traditional character of the house. Pelekas is a lively village on a hill with everything you need (bakery  cafe-bars  restaurants  market) around the square. The house location is very convenient just next to the village square. There might be an issue for people with mobility problems because access to the house is through a few steep steps. Free parking is available within less than 3-5 minutes walk from the house. The view from the house (from both floors and veranda) is fantastic looking at the village rooftops and church  the green hills and the sea. The hosts are really friendly and helpful and communication was great.
13195049,Mark September 2019 The apartment is amazing. Theodore met us in the village and took us to the apartment. It has everything you need and the terrace is amazing. The views day and night have to be seen to be believed. The fridge already contained bottles of water  butter  pastries  yogurt  fruit juice and coffee. There was even a bottle of wine which was a nice touch. Pelekas is in a perfect location to explore the island. The taverna's in the village all serve amazing food and all within 5 minutes of the apartment. I would recommend Avgis Place to anyone preferring a village feel. That's not to say that it's a quiet place  there was always something to do in the evening from coffee bars  taverna's and bars open late into the evening. You won't regret staying in the apartment or the village. We will certainly be back. Thanks for everything Avgi and Theodore.
13195049,Merel September 2019 Beautifull house  in a really cute town in Corfu. Only nice people  beautifull beaches close to the house  good restaurants and a nice cocktail bar: Zanzibar  around the corner!
13195049,Sirma July 2019 A wonderful place in an authentic Greek village! Nice hosts!
13195049,David May 2019 We spent 9 nights at Avgi's. Everything we needed was at the house  the bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. We ate in most of the Pelekas restaurants - Jimmy's was our favourite. Pelekas beach is great but a good 40 minute walk away. Views from the balcony are spectacular. Avgi and Theodore made us very welcome.
13195049,Ervilia May 2019 Avgi is great! super quick in responding our questions and super helpful too. Check in/out went really well & easy. Apartment is nice & exactly as described. Thank you Avgi for your hospitality. We enjoyed our stay a lot and feel very welcome! Totally recommend Avgi's place.
13195049,Yoginder April 2019 This is a cosy place located in the centre of the village close to all ammenities. We enjoyed the amazing view from the balcony and the host is very friendly and helpful in every respect. We are already thinking of going back again. Thank you for a lovely experience
13195049,Luise October 2018 We had a great time in the appartment. The terrace had an amazing view and the location was perfect. We could reach the best beaches within only a few minutes by car. Avgi and Theodore were very friendly and helped us in need. We would come back any time.
13195049,Emma September 2018 My husband and I loved  loved our stay in Pelekas..a beautiful authentic little village with heaps of character..views are outstanding and the people are lovely! Food was also outstanding in the village and the house was just perfect! 5*
13195049,Jane September 2018 A beautiful traditional Greek house in the most amazing location! This is an absolute must do for anyone that wants a peaceful getaway. The house was so completely charming and so well equipped and close to local bakeries and Tavernas. An absolute delight!
13195049,Marina July 2018 Avgi's house is located in the best place to stay in village  the house is nice and comfortable  and the view from terrace is gorgeous! The village is calm  there are a lot of restaurants and shops. About 2km from the house you can find beautiful beach with warm water and sand. Really good place for vacation :)
13195049,Zuzana July 2018 Avgis house is located in the beautiful village pelekas very close to the Capital city.we were there with our two kids 4and7 and had no problem in the house. All you need od in the house.there are many restaurants around and also little shop where u can buy what u need.theodore picked us up at the airport and helped us with to hire the car.we highly reccomend to go to avgis house for holiday.
13195049,Peggy June 2018 We had a very nice stay and enjoyed the view from the terrace in the evening. We recommend the smaller beaches next to Pelekas beach. We would definitely choose again the beautiful accommodation! thank you for the hospitality!
13195049,Wouter May 2018 We stayed here for a week. It was the perfect spot to discover the island. It is located halfway the Corfu Trail and close to some beautiful sandy beaches.  Avgi and Theodore were very hospitable and always quick to respond. I definitely recommend this place!
13195049,Anna May 2018 This place is really lovely with many romantic details and good thinking behind it all. The place is georgeous and the views are beautiful. Kitchen and bathroom werde well equiped. We were picked up from and brought to the airport. There was even a cute welcome present. We enjoyed the time at Avgi‘s so much!!! There is nothing more to wish for!
13195049,Erkan May 2018 Staying with Avgi and Theodore offers the experience of what it might feel like to be a Corfiote yourself. The access to their home is easy with a car  and Pelekas is a beautiful place to explore the island from. Theodore was helpful and always available when need be. We made good friends with the bakery down the stairs of the street and with Jimmy's restaurant up the hill. The apartment was clean and tidy and we didn't mind having to go outside to take the stairs to the upper part of the apartment at all. Highly recommended!
13195049,Moritz April 2018 We had a great time in the cozy apartment in Pelekas! If you want to relax and to take a break from everyday life  this place is perfect for you!
13195049,Angela April 2018 In late march to early April  during easter 2018  we spent 10 days at Avgis place at Pelekas. When we arrived (together with our host  who fetched us at the airport) there was a storm raging on the island and a lightning struck one of the buildings in the neighbourhood  causing a power breakdown in the whole village. Our host did everything possible to restore the electricity (which was finally back the next day)  he even offered us to stay at his place in Korfu-town. This was one of many examples for the friendliness and helpfulness of our hosts. Thank you again  by the way :)  The place itself was very beautiful. The bed upstairs was comfortable and the room lovingly decorated. The view from the terrace was so beautiful  that we sat there for hours just watching over the sea  small hills  Corfu-town  the roofs of Old-Pelekas and even the Grecian mainland in the far distance. Downstairs was a small kitchen which included everything we needed for cooking and a small but beautiful bath. The living room was directly connected to the kitchen and had a couch as well as a big table for at least four people.  Pelekas itself turned out to be the best place for staying at Corfu (at least for us). In 20 minute distance to the airport and Corfu-town  it was the ideal place to start trips to every destination on the island. Beside Pelekas charming  rustical beauty it also offered restaurants  bars  cafes  bakerys and a mini-market. Most of them had opened  although it was off-season and most other places on the island were still closed. If we will come back to corfu  we definitly will take the same residence. And so should you :) Show more
13195049,Virág September 2017 This house is perfect! There is everything what you will need during your holiday. The hosts are helpful and kind  they left fig compote in the kitchen what was extremly delicious! I can recommend to everyone!
13195049,Holle September 2017 We spend 12 wonderfull days in Avgis cozy Apartment. The place was very clean and nicely decorated. Avgis Husband Theo picked us up from the Airport in the middle of the night and was very friendly. Pelekas is a beautifull little village with everything you need and great beaches very closed to it. Only points of critique could be that the mattress was kind of uncomftable to sleep on and the wasps made relaxing on terrasse nearly imbossible. But i can really recommend the place to anyone.
13195049,Ela July 2017 The flat is really nice and the views from the balcony are amazing. The flat has two floors connected by an external staircase. There is also a good sofa bed in the ground floor which was usefull for some friends that stayed only for part of our trip.The village is gorgeous and very local and can be a bit lively at night with concerts until 2am. The beach is super nice and not too crowded but still with all facilities and water sports. The hosts were great and even with a 3 hours delay flight arriving at the flat at 3am there was no issue at all. There was also some liquor  water and some fruits to welcome our arrival. They also arranged and took us to a local hairdresser as we were actually attending a wedding. It is also 15m from corfu town and other nice places. I definitely recommend this place.
13195049,Marion October 2022 Beautiful view from the terrace  lovingly decorated house  bakery and restaurants just around the corner. You can quickly reach the beach by car. We felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Anja September 2022 The two of us traveled as friends and had a great time in the beautiful apartment. The apartment is very centrally located  not far from everything important. Just a few stairs and you are in front of many delicious restaurants  a bakery and supermarket. The clean apartment is very nicely furnished with lots of accessories and a great terrace where we ended the evenings with sea views. Check-in was hassle-free  even when our flight arrived with two hours delay. The village of Pelekas is inhabited by many lovely people one is part of the community. We had rented a car...you can also walk to the beautiful Pelekas Beach in 25 minutes. Otherwise  we have quickly reached many great destinations ( Angelokastro  Porto Timmoni  Agios Stefanos  etc.). Our special recommendation is the restaurant Jimmys  the Zanzibar and the delicious bakery on the village square. Great!!!! Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Laura August 2022 Avgi's house is a very nice and sweet house. We were kindly welcomed with welcome drinks in the fridge. In the kitchen  everything you need to cook with is available. We really liked the rock face of the shower. Upstairs is a spacious bedroom with large bed and plenty of storage space in the closets. Here is also the roof terrace with beautiful views  where we ate breakfast every morning. Pelekas is a nice little village  with good restaurants and a great cocktail bar within walking distance. Nearby are many beautiful beaches that you can visit  we had rented a scooter to explore it. There is also a bus (11) from (and to) Corfu Town. This stops at the Mouxcha stop  from there it is a few more minutes walk up. The Kaisers Throne is absolutely not to be missed when visiting Pelekas  enjoy a nice sunset here from the viewpoint or over dinner at the restaurant there. Thank you very much Avgi! Translated from Dutch  Show original
13195049,Esnaut August 2022 No complaints about this rental. Avgi's companion was lovely for our welcome: accurate  punctual. The rental has a lot of charm and offers a perfect view. Use of car is required to reach the beaches (5 minute drive). Take a leap of faith at Jimmy's restaurant  not the best panorama  but the hospitality and dishes are top notch. Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Katarzyna July 2022 Thank you so much for a great stay  your Superhost title is well earned  and our time in Pelekas  Avgi  was amazing. A vibrant and functional place with a great terrace and stunning sea views on either side of the island  from Kerkyra's skyline  overlooking the mountains and beautiful mountain villages  all within the frame of the beautiful rooftops of Pelekas and its surrounding cottages in the foreground. From the deck  you can watch amazing sunrises and eat meals at a comfortable table as a part of this landscape. Shops and cafes and bars within 2 minutes ;) Great communication with owners  great check-in and checkout - great equipment. Sure  if we return to the island to Avga :) Recommended as a family of 4  the house will be good for 2 and 4 people :) Translated from Polish  Show original
13195049,Karin October 2021 A wonderful cottage in the old village center of Peroulades. Very nicely renovated  with great terrace and super comfortable bed. We stayed there for 5 days  but would have liked to have stayed there longer. The place offers many  good taverns nearby  beautiful hikes to the surrounding mountain villages  end the day in the evening on the village square in the cafe/bar. Communication with Avgi worked out very well and we say again a big thank you for the generous welcome with all kinds of treats and comfortable living in authentic surroundings. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Cécile August 2021 Very quiet cottage with stunning views of Corfu and the sea. It is possible to eat on site. There are countless typical small restaurants. A small supermarket and bakery are also at your disposal. Let's not forget the Pelekas Café located in the square where you can cool down.... Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Massimo August 2021 I can fully confirm the reviews I've read previously... clean. Complete with everything and very functional. We had a good time. Our son didn't want to leave... Translated from Italian  Show original
13195049,Margit July 2021 What a nice apartment in the old town! Very centrally located in less than a minute you can reach the nice main square with cafes   minimarket where locals and tourists meet. The apartment is well equipped. A public parking is in the immediate vicinity. Would highly recommend this place and this village. The view from the terrace is priceless. Thank you and keep it up!! Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Aileen September 2020 We can only agree with the previous reviews. The village is really cute. Nice beach  good food  nice people. The apartment is as described charming and authentically modern. It has everything you need. Clear recommendation! The only beautiful thing would have been a roof that stops the water even in rainy days  so you could still sit outside. That's the only thing. Thanks for the nice uncomplicated stay. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Jean-Philippe July 2019 Amazing welcome since Theodor Avgi's husband  very friendly  picked us up from the boat (late arrival) and a bottle of Restina  candied kumqats  tapenade and the essentials to make coffee were waiting for us in the kitchen. The terrace is even better than the photos show: you have a view of both coasts of the island. Translated from French  Show original

13195049,Claudine July 2018 Very warm welcome from Théodore  Avgi's husband who tastefully decorated this charming village house  full of authenticity. Shaded from the sun by a plant-based arbor  the terrace offers a great 180-degree view above the rooftops: on one side the west coast that Pelekas overlooks with its beaches  on the other the east coast  the harbor and the two citadels of Kerkyra town  just 15 kilometers away. To exceed this exclusive pleasure  you have to climb to the famous Kaiser Throne  a former imperial observatory quickly reached on foot and from where you can embrace the entire green landscape of the island. This central location is perfect for exploring Corfu! Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Gerd April 2018 The apartment in Pelekas fully complies with the description and is very well equipped. The roof terrace with the beautiful view in particular delighted us. Avgi and Theodore were great hosts. Although our flight was significantly delayed and we arrived at night  we were received in a very friendly manner. Pelekas is a very nice mountain village and ideally located to discover the island with a rental car. We would book the apartment again at any time:-) Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Giorgia September 2017 The house is very nice  located in a very nice and well-stocked mountain village. From the house's terrace you can enjoy a great view of almost the entire island  which is charming. The house is equipped with everything: towels  bathroom essentials  pots and more. When we arrived  they brought us water and fruit harvested from them. The owners are very helpful  they drove us to the airport on the day of departure. Translated from Italian  Show original
13195049,Amélie August 2017 We had a great holiday in Corfu and especially in Avgi's home. This cottage is pretty and very well located in a city that we loved for its beauty and the kindness of the locals. The accommodation is also very nice  bright especially thanks to its beautiful terrace. In addition  Avgi is really friendly  accommodating and available because transfers are made from the airport to the accommodation even at late hours! We recommend this accommodation to all because it is accessible to different shops (supermarkets  restaurants  bars ...)  the beach and the bus. It will make you have a good time on the island of Corfu! Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Mirco July 2017 Clean and well-kept house  the spaces are well utilized  the hosts are available and very kind  they gave us a ride from the airport to the house and vice versa. Translated from Italian  Show original
43503163,Alexandros August 2022 We had a lovely stay at the Yuka Cottage  a very nice place at the center of Corfu run by very friendly and warm people   Kate and Toine. We had the time to relax in a quiet place  away from the crowded noisy and packed places in the high tourist season of Corfu . Private swimming pool was a pleasure for our children since they spent a lot of time there. I will surely reconsider staying there when we go back to Corfu and I will also recomend it to anyone who ll ask. Thank you Kate and Toine! See you soon!
43503163,Jens August 2022 We had a wonderful family stay at Kate’s place. The house and the interior is very nice. A great benefit are the different balconies where you can find a relaxing shadowing place. The pool is wonderful. The house is surrounded by a lot of trees and plant and you feel like to be in the nature. You can also enjoy the sunset there. Furthermore the host is ver friendly and helpful.
43503163,Georg August 2022 This place is a beautiful sanctuary. Great pool  nice outdoor showers  comfortable beds and nice interior. Kate and her husband are wonderful hosts who are very helpful and communicative. We felt very welcome!
43503163,Carolina July 2022 Very comfortable house with beautiful swimming pool! Nice beds  clean  full kitchen  new interior  enough sitting corners outside to choose sun or shade. Supermarket and delicious taverna 5 minutes drive. Owners are really friendly and helped us whenever we needed them. Perfect spot to rest and explore the rest of Corfu!
43503163,Marieve July 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at the Yucca Tree Cottage. Our hosts were wonderful  greeted us well helped us whenever we had questions or needed help. The house itself was private and very charming  surrounded by nature with beautiful views of the sunset and lots of outdoor lounging areas. Not to mention the pool which we had to ourselves  and which our kids adored. The house is well located  close to beaches and restaurants. I highly recommend it!
43503163,Manuel July 2022 We recommend this amazing accommondation. It is for all people who like the silence of nature and privacy. You only share the area with the owners. They live in another House next to the guest house. It always was a pleasure to talk to Kate or Toni. But they take care of your privacy. You have your own private pool. Which is fantastic after a beach day. We also spent some days full relexed on the pool. This place ist perfect to visit all highlights in Corfu. Of course you need a car. They kitchen is good equipped. We cooked almost every day. In the near are good restaurants too.  The communication with Kate was super easy and she had very good informations about Restaurants and the hole area. When we come back to Corfu we would love to stay here again
43503163,Bernd June 2022 We really enjoyed our two weeks at Kate’s and Toine’s place. The pool is just divine and made our stay so much more enjoyable. We loved the location: short drive to Corfu town  lots of small lovely villages around with lots of restaurant options and at the same time equal distance to explore south and north Corfu. While there is a road close by  the traffic noise disappears into the background so that it is hardly noticeable. Kate and Toine are lovely people and it was a pleasure meeting them. Would we book it again?: 100% YES.
43503163,Serena June 2022 As another reviewer commented this is bigger than it looks on it photos and perfect accommodation for exploring the area which is lovely. The swimming pool is gorgeous and Toine and Kate were extremely welcoming. Lovely stay!
43503163,Torben September 2021 A very nice and private small house  only sharing the property with the owners. The house boasts two comfortable bedrooms  a living room with a kitchen and bathroom. Outside there is a cozy shaded place and a small terrace perfect for dinning. Furthermore  there is a big pool equipped with sun beds a umbrellas. We definitely recommend this place and  if there is chance  we will return some time.
43503163,Jan Bart August 2021 This house is much better than you would get from the photos! A fantastic  recently renovated house with plenty of space: two big bedrooms  fully equipped kitchen and a good bathroom. We were here with 3 boys who enjoyed the large long pool and space. Klaasje & Antoine are very friendly and experienced hosts  who went all the way to make this a memorable experience for us. For example  picking me up from the car repair garage  everyday new recommended places and beaches. The island of Corfu has so much to offer  from beautiful beaches  nature  Corfu town and restaurants. Highly recommended- we will be back (longer).
43503163,"Rona September 2022 The accommodation is lovingly decorated and offers space for self-catering. The landlords are present and can be reached quickly in case of questions  but otherwise ""invisible "" all day. The hidden location of the house is not far from the city. The island is almost only made of serpentines  a pleasure for a good driver  less for the passenger. ;о) We had a wonderful vacation time. Translated from German  Show original"

35151250,Abigail August 2022 We truly enjoyed our stay here! Nikos was such an accommodating and the location is perfect- Pelekas is such a beautiful village with incredible views! The apartment had everything we needed and the value for money is unparalleled! We would definitely recommend  and Pelekas is great for those relying on public transport as there is a blue bus stop (to get to Corfu Town) at the bottom of the hill. Thanks Nikos for the best stay!
35151250,Jack July 2022 Had a great stay! Perfect location. Would love to go back
35151250,Jakub July 2022 Nice place in a small village of Corfu island. I would suggest setting some house rules. I.e. letting people know that every little noise is heard and they should be quite especially in the middle of the night. We were woken up by the guests above us around 3am two nights out of three.
35151250,Bella July 2022 The apartment was clean  tidy and had everything we needed for our stay. The local restaurants were great and reasonably priced. The bus to Corfu town was reliable and the town itself was lovely with lots of shops and cafes. Nikos and Dora were very helpful and replied quickly to all of our messages. During our stay Dora brought us fresh towels and bed sheets and made sure that we were enjoying our stay so far. We would definitely recommend the apartment as long as you can hire a car/scooter to reach the beach. Response from Nikos July 2022 Thank you very much for your lovely comments ! We hope to see you again next year!😍😍
35151250,Shane June 2022 Our stay in Nikos's Airbnb was perfect.  The place was very clean and had everything we needed. We especially enjoyed the lovely terrace where you can sit and chill out for the evening.  Nikos's wife Dora was very welcoming and we felt very at home in Pelekas! Response from Nikos July 2022 Thank you very much for your lovely comments !You are very welcome to come back to our apartments next year !It was a real pleasure meeting you!Stay safe !
35151250,Aada June 2022 Really nice apartment with a nice view from the garden. The host was amazing and even gave us tips about best restaurants in the area. Would recommend!
35151250,Shirley June 2022 A wonderful little room in the most beautiful and rustic village - we would come back and stay here again many times over!
35151250,Maria June 2022 localisation is perfect  close to heart of Pelecas  with wonderful garden.
35151250,Adélaide May 2022 Very charming location in a typically greek village. Be advised that the nearest beach is not really accessible by foot  but the rest of the island can easily be reached by bus from Corfou town (Saroko). Being in a tiny village house  the isolation is not that good and there can be quite a lot of humidity (also  no oven). Otherwise the view and the tiny streets are lovely and the hosts are very attentive to your every need.
35151250,Emilija April 2022 Everything was amazing
35151250,Dániel April 2022 It was a really pleasant stay at a very beautiful place would recommend to anyone.
35151250,Miroslav October 2021 Nice small apartmen
35151250,Adrien September 2021 Very nice and pretty room with a great view on the see and the hills of Corfu.
35151250,Ludmány September 2021 This place is magnificent. Nikos and Dora are very kind and the communication was smooth before and during our stay as well. Pelekas  where the accomodation is  is beautiful  quiet and very authentic. I can only recommend their cosy and classy place.
35151250,Leona September 2021 We had a really nice stay. Pelekas is a really nice stay  an original. There a some bars and cafes. You will need a scooter or a car  but in the middle of the Island its easy to get to every corner of the island. Right above the apartment  is the second Aphrodites Room. Its a bit clairaudient. The Family is so helpful. At any questions they answered really fast and even arranged a taxi to the pharmacy.  We really enjoyed staying in Aphrodites Room. Thanks a lot :D
35151250,Maria September 2021 Great location  very friendly hosts who gave us many tips on the area  very cozy flat!
35151250,Bruno August 2021 Dora is a very nice and sympathetic woman. She replied very quickly and the flat was as big as expected  even though you could hear every step or cough very loudly from upstairs. Pelekas is very beautiful and the cats that are everywhere in the streets were adorable. Very polite and friendly neighbourhood. You should come by motorbike or car  but the motorbike seemed like the best option because of the tight  curvy and steep roads. With a motorbike there is good and fast access to the beaches and a drive through Corfu is possible. To the capital/airport it’s a 20-25 Minutes drive.
35151250,Benjamin August 2021 Great place to be. In the center of Pelekas. Great to visit Corfou.
35151250,Eve August 2021 It is a cute place that has everything you need. Sometimes it can be a little loud from the people upstairs  but overall it is a very nice  clean place with very responsive and kind hosts.
35151250,Deborah July 2021 Perfect for visiting the surroundings. Many thanks for your hospitality.
35151250,Damian September 2020 Very friendly people
35151250,Karthikeyan September 2020 A nice and clean studio located near the main square of Pelekas with everything you need - the path leading to this place is adorable. The host is lovely and helpful  and the communication with them is such a pleasure <3
35151250,Maria Veronica August 2020 The house is very comfortable and pretty also if is small. The host are very kind and ready to help. There is everything you may need. You ve to do some stairs to reach it but are not so much
35151250,Magdalena July 2020 The studio is located near the main square of Pelekas  among the adorable  unique white paths. Very good comunitated with the bus to Corfu Town. There are also some shops and great tavernas nearby. The apartament was very clean and cosy  equiped with everything we needed. There was also the place outside the studio where we could sit and drink coffee in the morning (or excellent greek beer in the evening 🙂). The comunitacion with Nicos was a pleasure  he was always answering our questions quickly and was helpful in every situation. We are very happy we could spend such a nice time in Pelekas. Thank you Nicos for hosting us 🙏🏻
35151250,Remo September 2019 A very nice and kind person! Perfect host  great communication  friendly and with a lots of good tips about everything concerning Pelekas. Hope to see you again in our next holiday. +++
35151250,Michèle Maria September 2019 Nice stay for a young couple. Pelekas has all you need  good food  a bakery  small supermarket etc. Very simple  not luxurious but for the price totally appropriate. The communication was good and we even got a car arranged from the airport to pelekas and back.
35151250,Krasimir July 2019 Nice place if you need to stay in Pelekas.
35151250,Irene July 2019 Highly recommend this little gem :) great communication and hospitality.
35151250,Adam July 2019 Nice and cosy accommodation located in small streets of Pelekas village. Local people are really friendly  you can see the pure Corfu village life. The flat is approx. 150m from the center were you can find traditional tavernas  grill restaurants  bars  café's  small markets  scooter rental  etc. Nikos is kind person and greatly communicates. Highly recommended!
35151250,Simone July 2019 Arriving for the first time ever in Corfu  not having a clue on how and where to go about  our hosts were quick to answer the phone with a very welcoming tone and helped us with taxi directions etc when arriving at the airport. They were very kind and social and offered us to come and join them at one of the local bars. Had we been a couple who drank we would surely have joined them. During the trip they provided us with mosquito repellents and clean fresh towels and bed linnen. They have a back garden where you can drink your morning coffee in the cutest spot with the most amazing view over the land scape  towards the sea and the albanien mountains. Pelekas is a very charming village with a lot of olive trees. You will want to take lots of pictures of this unspoiled pearl. We had an amazing time and have been left with incredible memories longing to someday revisit Pelekas.
35151250,Claire September 2022 The apartment is conveniently located in Pelekas. Nikos and Dora are very kind and responsive hosts. Unfortunately  there are a number of negative points noted: • odor of sewage in the bathroom • mold on the shower curtain • refrigerator that no longer closes properly • very bad noise insulation  you can hear the neighbors upstairs as if they were living with us ...  With a few improvements the apartment could be really great. Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Larissa September 2022 Very cute place. Nice location! Very dear hosts!! Clean  you have everything you need! Highly recommended! The bus stop is 1 minute away and the buses run regularly to the city. (Small tip- the bus ticket can also be bought up the street in the shop (€1.50) is cheaper) Translated from German  Show original
35151250,Clara August 2022 Owners available and on time. The apartment is small and humid. The bathroom is blind without a fan and a window on the outside. The outside noises and loud noise from the tenants upstairs do not allow for a peaceful rest. Height of ceiling and bed length not suitable for tall people. Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Nikos August 2022 Dear Clara and boyfriend We have never presented our apartment as luxurious and spacious!We only say that it’s a traditional renovated apartment for two persons and the photos of it are completely real and even you can’t deny it!And of course the low price you paid for it justifies its size.Did you expect to stay at a five star hotel room at such a price?And even so why didn’t you respect it and the perfect condition it was in when you arrived?You left it in such a terrible mess with rubbish everywhere and dirty glasses pots and pans.Is this how you express your dissatisfaction?I didn’t expect that from two young and modern people.Please next time check our scores and reviews before you make any complaints about the apartment you’re going to stay!Most of our scores are 5/5 stars !And respect other people ‘s property by being neater and tidier !

Enjoy your winter in good health ! Translated  Show original
35151250,Alba July 2022 A good place to stay in Corfu. It is located in a very quiet residential neighborhood. What is the apartment itself is perfect for a stay in Corfu if you just want a place to sleep  shower and have breakfast. The photos are totally real. The only thing we didn't like is the bathroom  which needs a renovation and the garden that needed a little care of plants. Great value in Corfu Translated from Spanish  Show original
35151250,Élodie July 2022 The accommodation is located in a very nice village. Locals are friendly and welcoming. In terms of accessibility  you have the bus that connects to Corfu in 30 minutes.  Pelekas beaches are quickly accessible.  The accommodation is pleasant for a short stay. The photos in the home are a pleasure to trace the history. Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Joséphine May 2022 Warm welcome  beautiful setting  amazing locals. Big downsides  on the other hand  on the sound insulation and the bathroom which makes the bedroom very very humid. As for the room  it is correct for us who have moved a lot and who were not during the day! Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Rosa April 2022 Super nice hosts  the two. We felt welcomed and also got some tips for exploring the island. The village of Pelekas is totally beautiful and there you can have a great breakfast  coffee and eat. The accommodation was small but nice and we lacked nothing. Translated from German  Show original
35151250,Yann September 2021 Very pleasant stay in Corfu  with this small air bnb location located in the small traditional village of Pelekas. Beautiful view  very friendly locals and roof what it takes to have a good time (delicious restaurants  shops  bars and cafes etc...) Our guests were impeccable !

35151250,Χρήστος August 2021 Everything's good Translated from Greek  Show original
35151250,"Nancy July 2021 I can only recommend staying at Aphrodite's rooms and studio. The setting is beautiful  the view is crazy. The apartment is located in the heart of Pelekas  you are 2 steps from the ""center"" where you will find restaurants and bars. In this small village  everyone knows each other but welcomes their tourists with kindness and love. We loved spending evenings with the locals. So adorable and smiling. A little extra for those who love animals; there are a lot of cats on the street that leads to the center to the unit. We had so much fun cuddling and feeding them. A stay I wouldn't forget. Some tears at the time of departure as the atmosphere is special and valuable. Nikos  Dora and their sons are very responsive and just as kind as the residents of the village. They even offer to transport you from the airport to the accommodation for €30 and vice versa  which is quite convenient. The only downside I could give is the lack of soundproofing between listings but that certainly didn't stop us from enjoying the place. I highly recommend it! Thanks again for everything. Translated from French  Show original"
35151250,Thea June 2021 very nice hosts with a great place. Unfortunately  the path to the beach is very long and strenuous. As a cheap place to stay in Corfu  but definitely recommended. Translated from German  Show original
35151250,"Vincenzo August 2020 Aphrodite was impeccable. She was always present in all our requests. She helped us when we needed to print documents to be able to return to Italy due to Covid. There's no shortage of warmth and warmth.  However  I am sorry to say to those who decide to book  that the apartments  as the same owner have told us  have been renovated and refurbished but have not been soundproofed. My partner and I had a hard time sleeping because you could hear everything people did upstairs. So after a few days we asked to change apartments and Aphrodite was very kind in accommodating us by giving us a room on the first floor. But unfortunately the problem persisted as  as mentioned  the various apartments are not soundproof. The quality of sleep was not the best for us. The main rule is adaptability. The ground floor apartment  above all  is very nice but very small. There's not a table  but a bench with stools where you can eat. In the bathroom you take a shower with the boiler next to it. The bathroom with respect to the rest of the house has not been refreshed as decoration but is still functional. I have to say  for the price you paid  it's more than fine. The only negative note I repeat  is the noise between the different apartments. To get to the accommodation  if you use the navigator I recommend you put ""Pelekas Cafè"" as your destination. Then enter ""Aphrodite's Room"". You can't go wrong.  If you are planning to rent a car  know that you will have to leave it along the way and then walk to the accommodation. But it's easier with a scooter. You will be able to get to the apartment without any problems. Show more Translated from Italian  Show original"
35151250,Κυριάκος August 2019 Great all! Very welcoming hosts and the house sparkling clean!! The place is fantastic with narrow streets and very nice old houses! Great view! Translated from Greek  Show original
35151250,Alessio August 2019 Small but characteristic apartment  immersed in a typical Greek country in the hinterland but with nightlife  great restaurants and in a strategic position with respect to the island. If you need help visiting the island  I recommend it and the owner is very friendly and helpful. Translated from Italian  Show original
35151250,Isabelle July 2019 We were greeted by Dora and are sons who kindly helped us get our luggage up to the studio ! There is no access by car  and in the end it's very good because it's very quiet ! These are small pedestrian alleys  very cute  lined with jars of aromatic herbs that emanate from fantastic smells! Very functional studio with kitchen  coffee maker .... the table was set up with nice glasses and plates .... a small terrace with table and chairs with sea views! It was great ! Thank you Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Richard November 2022 gorgeous location with incredible views. modern  clean and comfortable apartment and a very welcoming host. highly recommended
32667873,Luna September 2022 Nikos' and Dora's place is situated on the hill in Pelekas with a stunning view across the island from the balcony. It is a small apartment but perfect for us as a couple. It is equiped with everything you need such as a small kitchen  dining table and balcony. The neighborhood is very nice and scenic  a beautiful small greek town and the beach is nearby. We do recommend renting a scooter or car because the walk to the beach can be a great climb.
32667873,Claudine August 2022 Beautiful spacious apartment with a panoramic view. Central location amidst the locals  I had a wonderful stay and felt at home! Will definitely be back!
32667873,Marius August 2022 The location is extremely far from any beach. The closest one is Pelekas beach  but I would not recommend it as it was dirty. Second closest is Glyfada which is great. The host was nice  but we didn't interact with her. The location is in village in Corfu  Corfu Town being almost 30 minutes away and you can't get there without a car (which is 100 euros per day) or a bike (65 euros per day). The view from the balcony is very nice and if you want a holiday far from city noise  it will suit you. At night  there are a lot of mosquitos and bees. Overall 6/10.
32667873,Maël August 2022 Fantastic sunrise every mornings  Nikos is so kind  and it’s a cute apartment in a very cute village ! I will recommend it a 100%
32667873,Tia July 2022 Great location if you want to experience an authentic Greek village. The hosts were hospitable and available if needed. The accommodation has a stunning view and ideal if wanting to stay for a few days and explore the island.
32667873,Zuzanna May 2022 The place was very clean and the owners are incredibly nice and helpful. Highly recommended :)
32667873,Kira-Lily April 2022 Our stay at Aphrodite Rooms was comfortable  enjoyable  and relaxing! The hosts were very friendly to us  meeting us at the square and giving some recommendations. They were great communicators and easy to reach via whatsapp whenever we had any questions. The balcony has a great view of the island and across the sea to Albania and mainland Greece  which we appreciated a lot. The apartment is fitted with basic requirements (towels  cooking equipment  enough shower gel for a day or two) as well as tea  coffee and some biscuits which was a nice touch. Pelekas is a lovely  friendly town and we felt warmly welcomed by the locals. The bakery in the square is a great place for some breakfast and the cocktail bar a little up the hill was a lovely night time spot. If you are renting a car and aren't used to driving in small towns then I would suggest avoiding driving through the town as it gets very tight  but there is some free parking just outside of the village and also space along the side of the roads. I would surely come back to visit Pelekas if I am in Corfu again and would recommend this apartment :) Only things to note are - the bathroom is very small and the hot water in the shower doesn't last for too long  so it's not the place to take a nice long shower  and the walls are very thin so you can really hear the neighbours. For us this was no problem  but if you are expecting total quiet then you may not get this in this type of building. Show more
32667873,Igne April 2022 Staying at Nikos apartment was very pleasant and cozy. The village of Pelekas is really authentic and beautiful.
32667873,Charlotte October 2021 We really ejoyed our stay in pelekas. The owners were really really kind. They helped us carry all of our stuff and showed us everything. They also were very helpful and gave good advise for activities/restaurants.  The apartment was totally fine  the view from the tiny balcony was amazing  we watched the sunrises each morning.  We can recommend the town's bakery a lot. We really fell in love with Corfu.  Thanks a lot for a great time in corfu
32667873,Paul September 2021 Just love for this opportunity to live in your cozy apartment! We will tell our friends about it and keep you in mind.  All the best to you  Paul and Tonia
32667873,Margot September 2021 Nikos and Dora were very nice hosts and the place is cute! The view from the balcony is stunning (lot of wasps this year so we couldn’t enjoy it as much as we would have unfortunately)  and it’s worth waking up early to watch a sunrise. The only negative thing would be the noise : the fridge war incredibly loud and we could hear everything that happens in the room downstairs (the other Afrodite’s place to rent)… Pelekas village is the most perfect location : very nice typical village  small but with everything you need and super atmosphere  and centered on the island so you can ride everywhere easily.
32667873,Jan September 2021 Awsome  we are very satisfied👍
32667873,Talea September 2021 We had a wonderful stay! It was very clean and there is anything you need. Whenever we had a wish or a question  Nikos and Dora replied within a short period of time. We had a very nice time.
32667873,Rosália July 2021 The apartment was good  bathroom was a bit tiny.
32667873,Sandra June 2021 Not great not terrible.
32667873,Natalia June 2021 Apartment was clean and accommodated in all needed amenities. The balcony has great view over the sea. The village is small but has a lot of cafes and tavernas  also easy access to nearby beaches.
32667873,Hennie May 2021 Incredible view. Dora and Nikos are so kind! Lovely place among the people the old village!
32667873,Georgia October 2020 The apartment was a fantastic stay for 3 people for a week with Pelekas town being the perfect spot for us. Great bars  friendly and fun locals and beaches really close (although quite a tough walk back up if you don’t have a car). Corfu town was also fairly easy to get to by bus and really quick by car! The hosts were extremely friendly with loads of local tips! We had such a great time  can’t wait to come back! Nasai kala!
32667873,Kaja September 2020 Our absolute favorite stay on the whole island - appartment and location 10/10  so much love for detail  a beautiful little balcony. Everything we needed and felt right at home  not as touristy as in the other appartments across the island! Would DEFINITELY recommend!!
32667873,Bernadett September 2020 Nikos and Dora were very friendly and welcoming. The place is actually even better than on the pictures. Super clean and stylish. I can highly recommend staying here if you like quiet places and breathtaking sunrises from your own little balcony.
32667873,Grant September 2020 Fantastic place and hosts. Always on hand to answer any questions we had. Thank you!
32667873,Giorgos August 2020 We thank a lot Mrs. Dora and Mr. Nikos for giving us the opportunity to stay at their lovely place. The apartment was super clean and everything was under greek regulation for Covid-19. The view was incredible and we loved to have our breakfast outside while watching the morning sunrise. If we will ever go to Corfu again  for sure we will visit Pelekas and stay at this beautiful apartment.
32667873,Conrad August 2020 Amazing location to relax  with beaches and cafes all around.
32667873,Milena July 2020 What a beautiful little apartment! When we arrived  our hosts had prepared the flat with love: everything was super clean  the table was set with plates and glass  and on our bed we found a branch of fresh mint leaves laying on the perfectly folded bed sheets. We enjoyed our stay very much  especially we loved the view from the balcony where we were watching the stars during the night and the sunrise in the morning. Absolutely recommend! Beautifully furnished apartment  great hosts  and a super cute village surrounded by stunning nature. We would love to come again! Rami and Milena
32667873,Finlay October 2019 A very elegant space with an incredible balcony view and very convenient location!

32667873,Monika July 2019 Afrodites Apartment is really cute and clean. There was everything we needed and more. perfect for cupples or travels of two/three. the location is also really nice in Pelekas. cute and calming . thank you afrodite and Nikos for hosting me and my mam ! :)
32667873,Leonie October 2022 We really enjoyed our 10 day stay in Pelekas. The place is typical traditional and a highlight was the daily visit to the bakery  which you inevitably pass by as you walk through the narrow streets to the house. The studio is small but very nicely decorated and clean. We felt very comfortable. In the morning  when the sun rises  the light falls beautifully into the room  so it's also the best time to have breakfast on the balcony. From there you can look at Corfu city and the Albanian mountains in the background. Unfortunately  there is only sun in the morning  but otherwise the balcony is golden. Pelekas is perfectly located for us as a place as we had a scooter. In 25 minutes you are in Corfu town and at the most beautiful beaches and coves of the island (northeast of Pelekas). In summary  every evening we enjoyed coming back to our little studio:) Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Genaro July 2022 Lovely place as their hosts. The place is well located to get to know the island. We loved the apartment Translated from Spanish  Show original
32667873,Theresa July 2022 The apartment is very nicely located. It is very clean  tidy and cozy. From the balcony you have a really nice view and can watch the sunrise. However  the path to the beach is a bit inconvenient without a car. Nevertheless  we enjoyed our time very much:) Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Anaïs July 2022 Great stay in this well-located studio  everything necessary for the stay is there ( missing air conditioning and dish towel to wipe the dishes). The water is not potable a small bottle of water on arrival would have been perfect but the small shop in the center is open until very late. Pelekas is a very nice little village with several restaurants and bars (we recommend the pelekas grill and at jimmy's!). The apartment is located in a very quiet location away from the surrounding noises of the center.  We had a great time! Thank you Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Tatjana May 2022 The property is located in an old house  in the old village. It's basic  but all the necessities are there. The view is sensational and the hosts are always there when you need them and support them in every respect. The communication is sensational. This love has helped me feel very comfortable. The only shortcoming is the lack of insulation in the house. I have heard the people in the apartment below me as if they were in the same room. However  I was able to coordinate well with all the other guests and we were considerate of each other. I will definitely come back. Thank you Tatjana Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Axel April 2022 Small apartment in the center of Pelekas village  itself located in the center of the island. No worries to park. The locals are very welcoming and pleasant!

32667873,Юлия September 2021 The apartments fully correspond to the photos  very small  especially the bathroom  but very cozy! Lots of small touches that say hosts try to provide guests with the utmost comfort in such a small space. The kitchen had everything you need. The views from the balcony are simply gorgeous  I met the sunrises for three days here  and everyone was unique! Among the disadvantages  I can mention the lack of mosquito nets  and thin walls  you can very much hear the neighbors  although they did not make noise especially. In general  the apartment is excellent and the hosts are friendly and helpful! Recommended! Translated from Russian  Show original

32667873,Florence September 2019 Afrodite's apartment is located right in the middle of Pelekas' little alleys  it's really beautiful. It is well renovated and equipped. Very nice view from the small balcony overlooking Corfu and the sea in the distance. We didn't get a chance to meet Afrodite  but we were very well received by his little son at the village cafe. In short  we loved it and recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Nora September 2019 The apartment is absolutely great. The location is nice. The apartment is located in the old part of the village  which can only be reached on foot and is therefore very quiet. The view from the balcony is an absolute dream. In addition  everything is completely newly furnished and very clean and maintained. We absolutely enjoyed the days here! Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Daniele August 2019 The house is a very cozy studio  it has everything you need and is ideal for those like us who are looking for a quiet and absolute relaxation environment  the services are within walking distance and the sea is a 5-minute drive away.

30004666,Ognyan September 2022 I highly recommend this place! The house is exactly like the pictures. It's very clean  has everything you need in case you cook yourself. Great views from the terrace. The location is very convenient for exploring the island and visiting the western  sandy beaches. Vera is a great host - extremly warm and helpful. Thank you  Vera! We will be back!
30004666,Orsolya August 2022 Vera and her son were incredibly nice to us. Upon our arrival she was waiting for us with cold refreshments  home made jam and fruits. The accomodation was very clean and even nicer in reality than on the pictures. Newly renovated house with a lot of work in it  fans in every room and a very nice view from the balcony. Vera even showed us a shortcut to Pelekas. They paid a lot of attention to hygiene--change of towels on every 3rd day. The kitchen was well equipped with pots and bowls as well as the bathroom with hygienic products we couldn't bring on the airplane--which saved us a lot of money. House was about in the middle of the island which made everything accessible. If you want a caring host with a beautiful  well located house this is where you should stay. Perfect for bigger friend groups/families.
30004666,Patryk August 2022 Vera and her son are very nice hosts. House is really big and well equipment. Have all what you need during holiday. For sure one of the Best accommodation opportunities on Corfu when you travel with 6-8 people
30004666,Fernanda July 2022 Awesome and spacious place to stay  the view is beautiful. Location is perfect if you want to travel north and south  Corfu town is very close by. The host was very kind and helpful. We would love to come back!
30004666,Adrian June 2022 We had a great time at Vera's Apartment. The place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. There are no neighbors  so it is very quiet! Vera is a very kind and helpful woman. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
30004666,Sergey October 2021 An excellent  friendly  sweet hostess Vera and her son. Clean  atmospheric house near the road  but in a quiet location with great views. All the time they were wondering if everything is in order and if we need any help. Very pleasant emotions from the rest
30004666,Ana August 2021 Great house and the host was very friendly
30004666,Mihail Liviu July 2021 A perfect choice. The hosts are at their best in terms of hospitality and attention. There can be nothing better. Excellent location  away from unspoken noises for those who want peace but at the same time close to one of the most beautiful beaches  Glyfada. The villa is very nicely built  with spacious rooms furnished in an authentic Greek style  and the orchard in the middle of which it is built  brings shade and coolness. We felt really good and we will definitely be back.

30004666,Georgiana August 2022 We stayed for 10 days and had a great time! She greeted us with fruit and water and made herself available to give us the things we needed when we arrived very late. He cleaned the house twice even though it wasn't an amenity. It was a great experience! Translated from Italian  Show original
30004666,Luca August 2022 Vera and her son welcomed us beautifully and were always available for any need. The house is very nice and exceeded expectations.

30004666,Monika July 2022 It's a really fun place. It's a great place to stay  with a great view  just like the photos.

25163809,Eveline September 2022 Beautiful home and pool. Alex is a very nice and friendly host! And the recommendations from Sotiris were also very helpful!
25163809,Steffen September 2022 The house is new  lovely and clean. Floorplan is good and works perfectly together with the outdoor area. All amenities needed are present. All bedrooms have their own balcony and most bedrooms have two doors to allow for a cooling draft through mosquito nets at nights. The pool and outdoor area is carefully planned and beautifully executed with shaded area for dining/barbecue close to the kitchen  a patio area with furniture facing the setting sun and a pool area where you can find both sun and shade. At night the area is stylishly lit with indirect lights. Beds were quite hard to our liking (3 adults and 2 children) but others may prefer it.  NOISE Our main concern prior to booking was potential noise from the road. Unfortunately  this road turns out to be quite noisy. In the day when at the pool the noise from the road can be acceptable  albeit always present. At night this noise becomes more prominent and there is also noise from barking dogs  both the owner’s own two dogs just behind the house and from numerous neighbouring houses. We would have liked to have the doors in the bedroom open (with mosquito nets down) for a draft through the room at night but the noise prevented that – instead we had to close everything and use the aircondition. An additional nuisance was the mosquitos present inside the house from already when we arrived. Every night resulted in an additional 5-10 mosquito bites. An alarm in the living room also went off regularly due to low battery.  HOST Communication with the owner’s agent  Sotiris  was swift and good. Most recommendations to restaurants etc were good. When we arrived there was already ice cubes in the freezer and access to drinks if we wanted. The agent met with us in the morning before departure and was kind and helpful throughout. Show more
25163809,Deborah September 2022 Villa Alex is a beautiful house. Clean  well-appointed and spacious. The pool was maintained every couple of days by Alex. Communication was mainly with a guy called Sotiris  before and during our stay. He was always quick to respond and really helpful. We had a car so it was easy to get about and see the island. There doesn't seem to be a taxi firm local to the house  so if you need a taxi they tend to come from Corfu Town  which makes it expensive. There were a few negatives.......The house is situated on a fairly busy road and the pool is at the front of the house. With only a garden wall between the pool and the road  the noise from the passing traffic wasn't particularly relaxing. Also  the 4th bedroom is a separate studio at the back of the house. We were a party of 5  consisting of one couple and three singles  who all wanted a bedroom each  hence the reason why I booked this 4 bed villa. However  on arrival we felt like we had to negotiate the use of the 4th bedroom. It does mention somewhere that there is a separate studio available for parties bigger than 6 people  but I assumed that was additional to the 4 bedrooms. Wasn't a problem in the end but just something folk should be aware of. Also  I received a message at 9.30pm on our first night asking that we didn't have so many lights on as electricity was expensive!! Some of us were outside and some inside  so yes  there were a number of lights on but I felt that the cost of the villa rental should more than adequately cover that. Felt a little bit uncomfortable that we were being monitored so closely. On the whole though  the issues were small and our stay was a good one. Show more
25163809,Javier July 2022 We loved our stay in Corfú  Alexandros is very helpfull and everything was fantastic. We recommend him so much :)
25163809,Helen July 2022 This is a lovely villa in a great location for exploring the island . Only 20 mins from Corfu town and close to some beautiful beaches and Pelekas town. The pool is lovely and there are plenty of loungers . There is a shaded eating out area which we used every day . The house is lovely and cool even in hot temperatures .
25163809,Alasdair July 2022 lovely place. full of character
25163809,Lorna June 2022 What a villa!!! There were 7 of us and had plenty of room (and more importantly enough sun loungers round the pool). Sotiris could not have been more helpful/accommodating. Would flag you need to hire a car we didnt have one and could not get a taxi to come and collect us- luckily Sotiris got us a great deal on a hire car but most had sold out that last minute. There are a couple of tavernas in walking distance and a beach but with a v steep road down (not for the unfit) a car is a must have. Had a fantastic holiday and villa is perfectly situated to access the main hotspots.
25163809,Vivek August 2021 We just spent a week at Villa Alex and we really enjoyed it. The communication from Sotiris was exceptional. He gave us a list of recommendations and they were superb! Thank you Sotiris!  The pool area is brilliant. Our kids spent hours together in the pool and it was very difficult to drag them out. The villa is spacious and well equipped. It is located close to one of the best beaches in Corfu!!  We had a relaxing stay. On day 4  our kids didn't feel like going to yet another beach and we spent the majority of the day at the villa with great ease.  The villa is situated off the main road and very easy to find. The road noise didn’t bother us at all. There is a local taverna (1 km away) called Staurodromi and the food out there is excellent.  We would love to return to Villa Alex if we come back to Corfu. Show more
25163809,Ming August 2021 We had a great family stay. Villa Alex is a well appointed  spacious house with a lovely pool and plenty of outdoor space. 5 minutes drive from the beautiful eagle nest village of Pelekas  the house also has easy access to many beaches on the West Coast of Corfu and is about 20 minutes’ drive to Corfu Town where you will find buzzing nightlife  a great selection of restaurants  shops  markets and museums.  You can hear passing traffic during the day but at night the road is generally quiet. The air conditioning throughout the house was a must and worked very well. The kitchen equipment was adequate but could be more complete. We liked the separate self contained studio on the lower floor with a view on Pelekas. The team was helpful all along and easy to contact. A good choice if you rent a car and like discovering different locations.
25163809,Matheo July 2021 Very pleasant stay in a particularly relaxing and magnificent house. Alex and Sotiris are incredibly kind and available. The house is located in a very appreciable place  close to everything. For a discovery of the region and the peculiarities of this  I graciously recommend this rental.
25163809,Iliya June 2021 Great house with brand new pool in the country side. Communication with Alex and Sotiris was excellent and check in was a breeze. House is big  comfortable and clean. Since we had the house for 9 days  there was additional cleaning and change of linen/towels in the middle of our stay. There are no neighbours around  so no worries about noise in the evenings. Car is a must as the closest supermarket is a few kilometers away and closest restaurant is 1800m away. We followed the tips from Sotiris about which beaches and places to visit and they were all excellent! Cannot be happier. The only downside was that dishwashing machine was broken  and in spite of the assurances that it will be fixed in a few days  it was not.
25163809,Roxana June 2021 We had an amazing stay at Villa Alex! We were a group of friends spending our first holiday since the pandemic and it was absolutely perfect and everything we hoped for!  The house is beautiful and clean and exactly as the pictures and description show. It really felt like a home away from home and some days we didn’t event leave the house because everything was so perfect. Comfy beds  Spacious chill areas (inside and outside)  large and well equipped kitchen and bbq to prep your own meals and of course the incredible new  clean and refreshing pool to enjoy...  Alex and Sotiris were excellent hosts! From the moment we booked the house  communication was very pleasant and they were always quick to respond to any of our questions. We were Personally welcomed upon arrival with a bottle of wine and bottled water.. during our stay we received many many great tips on where to go  where to eat  boat rentals  etc. After asking where to get the best coffee  Sotiris even brought us the best “frappe cappuccino” of the island  to the house! They also made sure the house was kept clean and well maintained throughout our stay  regularly checking the pool and halfway through our stay the house was fully cleaned and we were provided with new towels and sheets without even asking for it... As said  excellent hosts!  The location Itself is absolutely ideal to explore all parts of this gorgeous island (car recommended).. Kerkyra town and the airport 15 minutes away  beautiful and unspoiled beaches very close to the house  central to explore both the northern and southern parts of the island...  In short: our stay Villa Alex made our vacation on the island perfect! Show more
25163809,David August 2020 Comfortable house. Pool is absolutely lovely and the location  while on a main road  is convenient for getting around the island.
25163809,Dora July 2018 A beautiful and very comfortable house  as shown in the pictures  ideal for a relaxing family holiday  and ideally located for trips to other parts of Corfu . The house is 10 to 15 mins drive from beautiful beaches and 20 mins from the town. Pelekas village nearby has nice restaurants and shops. Alexis is a wonderful host  very helpful  always available to answer questions and provide tips while very discreet at the same time. We had a wonderful time!
25163809,Serge July 2018 Alex is a great host. Very hospitable and sympathetic. The villa is as excellent as shown in the photo. I recommend for those who have a car available. The nearest beaches are perhaps the best in Corfu. I highly recommend Yaliskari beach. Next to the beautiful little village of Pelekas. Close to the Kerkira
25163809,Michael July 2018 The house was really nice and clean. With a car you reach nice beaches and restaurants in 10-15 min. Alex was a great host. Anything that was needed extra was taken care of immediately. We would come back anytime!
25163809,Mary August 2022 The house is nice and matches the photos. Some additional details: - A rather busy road passes along the pool which makes it quite noisy during the day. - access to the studio is not outside. No communication between the main house and the studio. We didn't mind but better to know because depending on the configuration of the families it can be inconvenient. - shallow pool on half the surface. Perfect for small children  less for adults who want to swim. In addition  there are water pressure problems  probably due to the overcrowding of the island in the summer. The result: no water or very little in the upstairs bathrooms around 7 p.m.  and the dishwasher washes very badly because of this problem. Covered outdoor dining area  very nice. Very hard plastic pool chairs  a small mattress on it would make them more pleasant. The kitchen also deserves a few more utensils for those who like to cook. Perfect and very effective communication with Sotiris. Overall we had a nice stay but it seems to us that the price is a little high considering the negative points indicated.

578744585432531974,Hege July 2022 We loved our stay at the apartment in the middle of Pelekas square and would love to come back. The apartment and the building it is located in were great  the view (in all three! sky directions) amazing  the location super and the mountain village of Peleka very charming.  In the apartment  you have pretty much everything you need. We were 5 people and could have wanted a few more glasses and coffee mugs and a bread knife. And we could have wanted an extra bedding. Our youngest of 10 years slept with us. The two bedrooms have two big  comfortable beds. But when 3 people are going to share a double duvet  it does get a bit of “overlaid.”  The apartment is very well suited for 4 people  possibly more if the children are young. But if you have small children  there is something else that might be an issue. (Only in July?) In the same square is a popular bar on a great roof terrace. It has a DJ playing loud music between 8pm-4am. Fun if you join the party  but if you're going to sleep  you'll need ear plugs. One night there was even a concert down at the square and we heard the music even better. We went out to the balcony outside the one bedroom  and had the best “space in the house” there.  The best part about the apartment's location was going out to the town square early in the morning and sitting under an umbrella in front of the church drinking an espresso from the bakery.

50920565,John September 2022 Absolutely lovely villa. We didn’t expect it to be as good as the pictures…but it was. Beautiful views of the ocean and we spent each night enjoying the pool and looking at the Ionian Sea. Johnny was great and gave us all the local details we needed. We would love to stay here again.
50920565,Darien September 2022 Incredible villa with unbeatable views  our stay at Ethra was perfect. From the infinity pool to the little tavern and beach down the road  it was the ideal place to experience Corfu. Johnny was an amazing host  going above and beyond to make sure it was a great family vacation. Honestly can’t recommend enough.

50920565,Jessica June 2022 We were in absolute heaven during our stay at this property. The house is perfectly provisioned for a perfect stay  from outdoor seating and dining areas  infinity pool  endless views and an array of amenities  we couldn't ask for more. The privacy of this place was amazing and quite near to a few local beaches and taverns. Johnny was so prompt with any questions and really looked after us. Thanks for everything  absolutely would stay here again.
50920565,Peter May 2022 Jonny is an absolute fabulous host & literally nothing was too much trouble for him. He was there to meet us on arrival at gone midnight and had even done a food shop for us for some essentials. The Villa is exactly is portrayed in the pictures.  The biggest disappointment however & the reason for giving a poor rating for “value for money” is that the Pool was not heating. Admittedly  this was an oversight on our part as the Villa description did not say that the pool was heated  but had we been aware of this we certainly wouldn’t have booked Villa Ethra as whilst the pool does look absolutely stunning  it was just extremely cold  quite apart from the fact that the Villa is high up & can be quite breezy. Johnny did point out that in the height of summer it wouldn’t matter  but we had good weather for the time of year with temperatures around 20° and still only used it briefly once or twice. Furthermore the sun doesn’t actually get on the pool area until around 11am anyway. For us the whole idea of having a private pool is to use it in the morning & after dark and this just wasn’t possible.  One final point worth mentioning is that whilst the Villa is on the whole quiet & very private   there were a number of days when para-gliders flew low & directly over the property; which was quite intrusive Show more
50920565,Rupert October 2021 A fabulous  modern villa with a wonderful view. I highly recommend it. The host  Johnny  was also a delight.
50920565,Vincenzo October 2021 Johnny was a terrific host! He welcomed us to his stunning villa and was helpful whenever we had any questions! the villa is stunning and only a short drive from the beach! Even though that weather was great every day we had a great time and Johnny was on hand to answer any questions or provide suggestions on what we could do! Would recommend him and the villa 100%.
50920565,Alice September 2021 This property is like paradise on earth! The location is quiet and quite remote but you can be at restaurants  bars and Corfu Town in a short taxi ride or car journey. However you won’t need to go far from the property as it has everything you need close by in the local area - beautiful beaches  amazing tavernas  fun bars. Johnny is also the perfect host who goes above and beyond to take care of his guests. As for the villa  it is stunning with views you can look at for days. We hope to be coming back!

29890659,Paul September 2021 We liked about Lidovois House the proximity to the sandy beach and a supermarket. The view from the apartment and the terrace is amazing. Parking is possible next to the house. The only thing which could be improved was that there was only one pan without a top and of a very low quality so cooking eggs for breakfast was really hard. Otherwise very nice place.

24343245,Loic August 2022 Nice house  well located on the island  an extra single bed in the bedroom to avoid having to unfold the sofa in the living room every day  air conditioning and WiFi  cleaning done in the middle of the stay (9 days). Fresh eggs  grapes  watermelon and peaches from neighbors  No jacuzzi  a washing machine that only works at 60°
24343245,Denys October 2021 We enjoyed our stay in this house. It is modern and spacious. Location is great  close to all attractions of central part of Corfu island  however away from noise  surrounded by olive garden. All people involved in our stay were excellent: Makis  his parents and friend Samis. Thanks to all of them! Hope to stay there again.
24343245,Viena September 2021 A lovely house surrounded by olive trees. The home itself has everyone one might need for a short or long stay. We stayed for about 10 days and cooked and watched movies (when not at the beach and exploring). The lovely elderly couple who lives next door was most generous by gifting us home made food.
24343245,Nejle July 2021 What a beautiful home! We had a very good time there  everything was perfect
24343245,Guillaume June 2021 Thank you to Makis and his friend Samis. It was a perfect stay. House is well equipped and is lost in beautiful nature. Thank you to Samis who gave us some advices about where to go. Hope to come back one day
24343245,Lucy May 2021 Makis' home is a spacious open plan house. There is a large communal space for hanging out  with a comfy sofa and tv if you want to chill out. The noise carries a lot  something to bear in mind if you are a light sleeper. The 2 terraces are nice for eating breakfast  and one has an incredible view of the landscape . The house is right next to Makis' parents house  so you will see them throughout the day - they were kind enough to drop some eggs off (there are hens in the garden). They also have a very cute dog! The nearest beaches are beautfiul and a short drive away (between 7-13 mins drive). Our favourite was Mirtiotissa (nudist beach - very secluded and nice vibe).
24343245,Philipp October 2020 We had a very great stay at Markis house. You has a nice view and it’s very quit. Nearby the house the are many nice beaches like Pelekas  Glyfada and many more. Mrs. Barbara and her husband are very friendly and very helpfully. If you have questions about good beaches  food or any else you can anytime ask Samis  a Friend of Markis. Thank you all! We would come back any time! Best wishes Philipp
24343245,Anne-Kathrin January 2020 We had wonderful 10 Days at the Island. Makis was a very friendly host and we always had the opportunity to ask  if we needed help/advice/... The house is absolutely wonderful with an amazing view  nice and calm. Perfect for relaxing and exploring the Island. We would definitely recommend!
24343245,Haja September 2019 We had a beautiful holiday in Markis house! Markis house has a very cozy atmosphere  there are everything you need to comfort pastime. The home located on a hill with mountains view. There are a few sandy beach and supermarket close to home. The hostess is very pleasant old woman. She lives in the neighbourhood and helped us for household questions. The man who met us is friendly guy. He helped us to rent a car a also he recommend the place that we needed! We have a good impression of Markis house ! :)
24343245,"Armin September 2019 If you want to spend your holidays on Corfu island  then you have to stay in Makis villa! We had a wonderful and relaxing time there! We did everything right with our decision!  The well equipped villa has two great terraces and is located in a calm but central area of the island. Near to Pelekas  near to the definitely best beach ""Pelekas beach"" and also closely to Corfu town. It is the best starting point for discover the island by car.  The wonderful and lovely parents of Makis living next door. The both are very fantastic people and Makis mum is such a warm and kindly person  who has sweetened our stay! What a wonderful and great mum. Thank you so much for everything!!! Also the friend of Makis  who cares about the guests  was cool  friendly and always achievable. Thank you Samis.  We had perfect holidays and would come back again anytime. Greetings Ceren and Armin."
24343245,Patrice June 2019 We had a wonderful stay at Makis House. His friend who did the check in and his family were lovely. We got fresh eggs and moussaka :) the house itself is very spacious and well equipped.
24343245,Matthes September 2018 Great location in the nicest area of the island! The house is very tastefully furnished and offers a lot of peace and privacy. The hospitality of Makis parents living in the house next door is marvelous. It's only 5 minutes by car to Pelekas and maybe 10 to Pelekas beach. We had a wonderful time and definitely would come back.
24343245,Nima August 2018 Dear Makis and Julia  thank you very much for letting us stay in your house for a couple of days! Great place  very nice house and a lovely mum of Makis who brought us fresh eggs from the own chicken and grapes from the garden. She really made us feel welcome! The location of the house is very good  too. Only a few minutes by car to Pelekas  to the beaches  to supermarkets and about 15-20 min to Corfu town. But you definately need a car. We can highly recommend Makis House for some relaxing holidays on the island Corfu.
24343245,Heloise August 2018 The villa is very spacious and has everything you could need  we had a very good time there. It’s conveniently located to explore the island and the village of Pelekas is within 10 minutes drive.  The hosts are nice and available  and the couple living next door are adorable and caring  they offered us food several times ... the legendary and amazing Greek hospitality:)
24343245,Marco June 2018 A wonderful place  a very comfortable house  a relaxing garden with bbq  nice hosts who take care of 6 cats!
24343245,Benedetta September 2022 The house is beautiful and perfectly reflects the photos and description. Surrounded by greenery  it offers a beautiful view for a relaxing stay away from the chaos of the city  but still within walking distance of all the points of interest on the island. Comfortable house only if provided with a car (20 minutes from downtown Corfu). To make the stay even more wonderful  the availability and tips from Samis  and the sweetness and kindness of the gentlemen who live in the house next door. Despite the bad weather  we were able to enjoy this vacation thanks to the location that allowed us to spend pleasant moments both outside under the large veranda and inside enjoying a hot bath. Translated from Italian  Show original
24343245,Taradel August 2022 Excellent stay. The house is spacious  clean and enjoys a very nice environment  quiet olive trees. Beautiful beaches are located not far from the house. All windows and French doors are equipped with mosquito netting. Communication with Makis is smooth and her parents  who live next door  are very kind and discreet. I highly recommend this accommodation. Translated from French  Show original
24343245,Katja August 2022 We stayed here for the second time and had a wonderful time again. The house is very well located  close to beautiful beaches and the capital. However  a car is recommended. Maki's parents are very warm and hospitable. The communication with Maki's friend for questions was also perfect. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Moritz June 2022 For a trip with a baby  the ideal place for recreation! The neighbors are world class! Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Julia June 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Makis's house! The house is close to the mountain village of Pelekas and only minutes away from the nearest beaches. The distance to Kerkira or other places on the island was also just perfect  so we had a great starting point for our many excursions. Makis' house is very generous  there were only two of us and we were able to spread out well. Right next to the house live Maki's parents  who are very  very nice. His mother Barbara even brought us some stuffed puff pasta bags with feta. There are also some cats and a totally cute dog  the Sissi  at the property. The house is very quiet and we felt very comfortable! You cannot expect to reach the beach within walking distance  you will definitely need a car. But if you have this  you can easily reach all the beautiful places in Corfu. Glad to come back! Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Alexander May 2022 We enjoyed the house  the furnishings and the care very much. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Daniel October 2021 We enjoyed Maki's house very much. The house is very spacious with your large terrace and a beautiful garden. It is well equipped and there was a small guest gift to welcome you. A rental car is absolutely necessary for your stay as it is very remote. But you live in the middle of nature. To very beautiful beaches  however  you can drive only 5-10 minutes. We were always supplied with great fruit from the garden. Our children (2 and 4)were also enthusiastic  they could move freely and quickly became friends with the cats. Mosquito net on all doors and windows  great! We would book this place again anytime. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Katja August 2021 We had a wonderful time at Maki's house. It is very quietly located  but still not far from Corfu city and beautiful beaches. It is also close to the village and some nice taverns. However  a car is highly recommended. We also enjoyed the Greek hospitality. We'd love to come back. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Marco July 2019 Really nice and functional house  impeccable cleanliness  very quiet and reserved location. A 15-minute drive to Glyfada and Agios Gordios beaches. Perfect assistance. However  highly recommended. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Tetiana September 2022 Nice place! Clean room! We spend great time in late with dancing. So close to beach  but better by car. I recommend this apartment
25889662,Ioannis September 2022 The place was terrible  they don't clean it well and it stinks. Also the next day the cleaning lady woke us up earlier than our check out to leave. As for the cleanliness we even found a dead worm near the eating table. Also in the bathroom the Aeration was full of flies and dust and there was only one big towel.
25889662,Andrew September 2022 I love Pelekas and this little apartment was perfect for my stay! Response from Ελευθερια-Σπύρος October 2022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT! HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT TIME IN OUR VILLAGE!
25889662,Ana-Maria August 2022 Good value for money! The humidity was indeed very high. Do not recommend to those who have respiratory health issues.
25889662,Monica August 2022 This studio is okay for 2 or 3 days  not longer. Toilet and WiFi don't work at all and the bed is very uncomfortable. The parking for the car is very dangerous.
25889662,Lukáš August 2020 Good
25889662,Leo August 2020 We had a nice time at Elly's Place. Although its a bit humid  its not smelly or dirty. The location is awesome  a typically greek small town with its own touch. The parking lot is rather for a small car. To sum up  we can defenetly recommend this place!
25889662,Jonathan August 2019 You are going to stay in the very center of the village and therefore not going to miss out on a single event going on there. The studio is built into the rocks and thus humid  which means you don’t need to switch on the air conditioner. The bed it ca. 1.40m wide. The people in Pelekas are very friendly and a 24/7 supermarket+bakery is just around the corner.
25889662,Lea August 2019 Nice apartment in the center of nice little town. Too bad it has moisture problems.
25889662,Peter September 2018 Small studio apartment with double bed. Well furnished though lacking basics for two people eg. only 1 mug  only 1 glass.  No wifi and very poor phone signal made it difficult to plan our days.  Shower is difficult to use as due to the drain and layout  it causes the bathroom to flood.  Location is good for Pelekas which has lovely restaurants and a pool bar  however  is a little isolated. Good bus link to the town  though infrequent. Walk to the beach is 30mins minimum and steep. Recommend a car.
25889662,Petr July 2018 Elly and Agnes are very good people and hosts. We had a great experience in Pelekas. The appartments are located in the center of Pelekas and surrounded with lot of of authentic greek tavernas. Agnes taverna is one of the great ones. We liked to have a dinner there  thanks to all who work there. Also apartments are near Casier throne with amazing view on Corfu. You can get to the sea in 20-30 minutes by foot  but you should be a bit trained to walk up back to the Pelakas)))) So consider to rent a car or bike. The sea in Pelekas beach is very clean and beautiful. Also amazing Glyfada beach is near by. We had a true greek vacation and were amazed. Thank you very much!
25889662,Asia July 2022 apartment in beautiful Corfu village very comfortable for the location near many beaches  nice owners and available to check in and out a little Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Victoria July 2022 Great location  it is perfectly connected between two beaches and at night there is a lot of movement  but the lady who brings the towels does not know English and both times she came to bring the towels she came in without our permission (because she also seems to have the keys) even though we had told her to wait since we were not in a position to open them. Apart from the first day there was never hot water and you feel everything as if the walls were made of paper  we had also left (and we are 100% sure) of the valuable sunglasses in the room but we didn't find them again and I really checked so well because I really keep order. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Flor June 2022 Pelekas was well located  close to the beach but walking up and down. The bus used to pass every other hour and in 20 you get downtown. Very nice room but too much humidity  the clothes don't dry and everything gets wet. There were no cleaning products making it difficult to maintain even though the cleaning staff arrived every day. We didn't have hot water for 3 days and we were told it was an island issue without coming to check  but it turns out that there was an electric water heater and the knob was off. The bed was extremely uncomfortable  the mattress expired and all the springs were noticeable. The only mini market that had a lot of things was overdue so pay attention. The WiFi was really bad.

25889662,Lucas September 2021 Very nice studio  located in a village where people are very nice  helpful  and available! The studio itself is very suitable  it lacks light and is a little damp because of it but nothing very bad. Great value for money! A few hot water outages that impacted the entire village during our stay  but there still not in the owner's control:) We had a pleasant stay. Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Zélie August 2021 Several problems during our stay: - High humidity in the apartment (the linen does not dry: annoying after a day of beach  smell of contained  moldy shower curtains) - Uncomfortable mattress (probably sprung) - Very bad communication with the host  she was not responding to our messages  we had to call or go to her place of work to talk to her - So mentioned in the host's listing  a lot of essential amenities were missing (shampoo  salt  sponge  dishwashing liquid  olive oil...). We had to show the host where she had mentioned these amenities so she could provide them to us otherwise she barely believed us!! - We had a very bad connection and had access to wifi the second last day (over a week-long stay) - No cleaning equipment is present in the listing. When you stay a week  you sometimes like to sweep to clean the apartment. - Presence of insects  Pros: - clean linen - air conditioning - accommodation in the center of the village Show more Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Iona August 2021 The house is really very nice and new  as in the pictures. The only problem is the humidity  which is really high although we had the air conditioning on for a long time  things don't dry. Wifi connection outside the apartment (it was only connected outside the apartment). They didn't give us the wifi password of the apartment saying that an old tenant had changed it and they didn't know it. They promised a technician who never arrived. Translated from Spanish  Show original
25889662,Guillaume July 2021 Charming little studio with exposed stone  in the center of one of the best villages in Corfu. The host is responsive and also sent a cleaner without us asking for anything which is really adorable. However  be careful about the humidity that some people in some people can be a problem. Well we had a wonderful stay anyway. Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Δώρα July 2019 The room is in a quite good location  with easy access to many beaches. Beautiful and clean space  however the room was very humid!! Translated from Greek  Show original
25889662,Jacopo July 2019 The location is excellent  the small town of Pelakes allows you to easily reach the most beautiful beaches and the center of Corfu. The apartment is well furnished and clean  great if you are two. July is very kind and helpful. Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Deborah August 2018 Everything was very clean and efficient. Excellent and comfortable location  beautiful and quiet area. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Fanny July 2018 Elly's apartment is very well located on the island and we had a nice stay there. Good value for money. Do not be overly demanding. The low price compensates for the few violations (no shower curtain  lack of ventilation  too much humidity) that it seems possible to improve. We were hosted very well by Elly's family. The village is very nice and lively in the evening (several restaurants and bars). Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Stefano July 2018 The place is a very small studio located in a nice busy village at night. There is no wifi and it does not take the mobile network  there are no windows  resulting in the smell of closed and humidity  there is no place outside to be able to stay with a coffee table  no drying racks or other things to dry clothes and linens  the shower without a curtain lock floods the bathroom  lack of any type of sponge  soap  broom and lack of cutlery  glasses  plates and pots for cooking. Very good location  parking  air conditioning and LED TV. Translated from Italian  Show original
41944666,Nourlhouda September 2021 The villa is great with an amazing vieuw on the montains ! We have enjoyed our stay. There was everything we needed and more. The hosts were very friendly. There is a private pool for the summer heat. The garden is so cozy and perfectly decorated. If you're searching for a typical greec vacation this is the place to go!
41944666,Kozachenko August 2021 We enjoyed staying at the place very much! The villa was super tidy and comfortable both inside and outside  it’s clear that the owner really cares about the guests’ comfort. We came late in the evening due to our flight delay  and were treated with a homemade supper! Chilling in the pool  making bbq  having breakfast or a glass of wine on the terrace listening to the sounds of nature we’re more than pleasant.
41944666,Joaquin July 2021 Everything was absolutely perfect! Zoi is a great host. The house has everything you may need and more! Perfect location  beautifully decorated  swimming pool  garden  etc.
5941318,Sofia August 2022 A pretty basic stay  if you are just visiting. The apartment had all the mentioned amenities  except from wifi. Slightly different than the photos. There were some beach essentials available but they weren't needed  as we had our own. Wouldn't recommend for more than 3 people and for large vehicle owners
5941318,Aimee August 2022 We had an amazing stay at Kelly’s. The place is beautiful with so much to do. Buses are regular and take you all around the island. Well worth the money. Very sad to be leaving.
5941318,Angel July 2022 Kelly and Joe are very very kind  they have been worried for us during all the stay. The only bad thing I could say about the place is that the pool has too much cloro for us. But the rest has been awesome!
5941318,Torgunn July 2022 We had a nice stay at Kellys apartment  and she let me check in early the day I arrived. The apartment is well eqipped  has good space  a cosy balcony and a wonderful pool. The annoncement on Airbnb are a bit misleading though. There was no internet/wifi. We could use the neighbours  which was unstable. There is no shuttlebus to the beach. There were no sunbeds at the pool which belonged to this apartment  I didn't know and accidentally used the neighbours. Kelly and Joe kept saying they should fix the internet and buy sunbeds during our stay  with no result. The neighbours were very friendly and helpful.
5941318,Marko June 2022 The apartment is about 10 minutes walk from Pelekas. This makes her very calm. It was clean  unfortunately the wifi didn't work. The pool is a highlight.
5941318,Marios December 2021 Well  miss Kelly wasnt here to help us but we had some communication through messages.
5941318,Rose September 2020 The apartment has beautiful views  a lovely pool (deep and not too chlorinated). The apartment itself is reasonably basic  but great value for money and frankly all you need when you’re going to be outside most of the time anyway. The area is lovely but everything is uphill so you really need to be driving/hire a scooter to get around  or be prepared to walk up a lot of hills! The neighbours are super friendly. Would definitely recommend.
5941318,Liz August 2020 A lovely little apartment just the right size for me and my daughter. Much cooler than I thought it would be but you do need the fan on. Lovely location used the pool and most days no one there. Didn’t have car but we like walking  if you want to go around island you would need car. Some lovely restaurants at the top of the hill. Went to beach twice no taxis available so expect without a car to climb a very big hill. Great place for the price and especially if you want some quiet time  lovely to sit on balcony in the morning to watch the sun rise
5941318,Francesco July 2020 Please note that this apartment does not have wifi and AC. The freezer was broker and the fridge didn't work properly. It might be good only for a very short stay  until these issues will be solved.
5941318,Giuly February 2020 Really bad communication!! At the last minute when it was time to give me the key she text me after many time that I try to contact her and she told me that the apartments was not available ! Really bad experience . Don’t go
5941318,Nora September 2019 Perfect position
5941318,Frances September 2019 Lovely location and the pool is great. A walk up to the village is worth the effort and there are many bars and restaurants close by. Corfu town by bus is also a good option.
5941318,Daan July 2019 An amazing experience; great location  beautiful pool and very hospitable cleaning service!
5941318,Talitha July 2019 A really lovely little apartment. Any problems that arose were dealt with quickly and kindly. The pool was mostly quiet and relaxing and the apartment itself was nicer in person than shown in the pictures. A short walk from the bus station and pelekas center which is very sweet. Really happy with our stay  would definitely recommend.
5941318,Dylan June 2019 A most enjoyable stay. Would come again.
5941318,Elena June 2019 If you need a complete rest from work  city noise  communication and stress  then this place is for you. Incredible  magical place for a good holiday. Very quiet  cozy  comfortable. It seems that you are away from everything and really enjoy your vacation. If you need the sea  then you can take a car  walk or bus. Nearby there is everything you need - shops  cafes  restaurants. But the main thing is that the house is in peace and quiet. Good apartments have everything you need to live. This is a really cool place and I will choose it for myself next time!
5941318,Andarachi August 2018 We had a great time and remained very happy and satisfield with our choice about the place.Kelly replied very quik at messagies and always ready to help.Everithing was as described.We recomend.
5941318,David July 2018 A lovely apartment  beautiful views and within easy walking distance of a very friendly village. I would love to stay here again.
5941318,Alison June 2018 Great place to stay if you want a typical Greek village   good places to eat   near the coast and a regular bus service ( 15/20 mins ) to Corfu town for 1 Euro 70. Kellys place was well equipped   plenty of hot water with towels and pool towels included. More space than the average holiday apartment with a balcony with amazing views. The walk up to the village was about 15 / 20 mins   take your torch for your walk back after dark. A good choice of Tavernas in the village but The Stavrodromi Taverna at the crossroads was our favourite . A simple menu  quality ingredients   well cooked and great friendly service. Hire a bike to see the local villages if you can.
5941318,Bee September 2017 We had a really lovely stay in Corfu  made better by the great location and ease of Kellys accommodation. It's in a perfect spot to be able to explore the island - we hired a car (company recommended by Kelly) and travelled around lots of different beaches and villages. The apartment is located in walking distance (albeit steep!) to a lovely village (Pelekas) which had great restaurants. We particularly liked 'Roula Taverna' which has the best Souvlaki in Corfu! The apartment was clean  tidy and had everything we needed for our short stay. The swimming pool was deserted most days - a real luxury! Great value apartment.
5941318,Dawn June 2017 Wonderful position with breathtaking views. Fantastic host offering a great stay.
5941318,Colin April 2017 Excellent place to explore Corfu from.  Easy to get to from the Airport.  Flexible checking in - I didn't arrive until nearly midnight with no problems checking in.  Nice quiet  central location to explore the whole island.  Fantastic view from the balcony to enjoy in the morning and evening.  Excellent comms from Kelly and a very stress free stay.
5941318,Simon January 2017 Kelly's place is well equipped and in a beautiful location. Great to watch the sunrise every morning from the second floor! Communication with Kelly was a breeze  and the apartment was well looked after. We stayed over Christmas which meant Pelekas was a very sleepy town with no open restaurants  but the locals were friendly and always good for a chat. During summer I imagine it would be quite the happening place! If you stay here be sure to take the path up the mountain behind the apartment  and go to Kaiser's throne to watch the sunset at least once.
5941318,Justyna September 2016 Kelly is the best host ! We knew everything  she gave us all information   tips and help in every question about Corfu. I really recommend this place  its cheap and there is even more than in description.  Pelekas is such a nice village  people are so friendly !
5941318,Paul September 2016 Nice apartment  ideal for 2 persons  easy to reach from the airport. We didn´t use the pool because the sea was just too nice and clear and warm. Check out Yaliskari beach and the taverna and the Zanzibar in Pelekas ;)
5941318,Barbora August 2016 Kelly is very nice and helpful person. We stayed in Kelly's apartment for 7 nights and we really enjoyed this holiday. Apartment was clean with a perfect location. Pelekas city si small city full of friendly people and good restaurants. I was with my boyfriend and 2 other friends so 2 of us slept on the bed upstairs and two on sofa. Sofa wasnt so comfortable for two adults but we put a mattress on the floor and finally we slept well :) . Weather was perfect and we really liked beaches and nature around. We rented bikes and boat what I really recommend. The bus didnt go to the beach so it is good to rent some bike and see more of the west coast which has so many amazing views. Like I said we ve also rented a boat for one day and we have visited some private beaches what was a big experience  unfortunately there were big vawes and really hot so 3 of us were out for the next 2 days because of heatstroke or sea sick I dont know :D but anyway we really enjoyed this holiday like I said and I can only recommend this place. Kelly thank you very much! Corfu is amazing! Response from Kelly August 2016 Thank you very much for your lovely review I really appreciate it. I'm glad you had a good time at the apartment and that you enjoyed Corfu. Kelly
5941318,Yasmin August 2016 Kelly was such a brilliant and trustworthy host  always tending to our queries with speed and politeness. The apartment was just as expected and Kelly even let us check in a bit early and coordinated with the cleaners to suit our arrival. The apartment also had a lovely pool with fantastic views over Corfu. Pelekas village is very traditionally Greek with wonderful tavernas and the kaisers throne viewing point (a must-see) with views over the whole of Corfu  this is only a 20 minute walk from the apartment to the top. The only downside was that the water would sometimes cut out  but this was no fault of the apartment! One of the fans were broken so we could only use one fan during the evening which meant the room was pretty hot. It was quite a steep and far walk down to the beach (not for the faint hearted) but the only issue is getting back up. We managed to flag down car lifts which was fantastic! There is also a bus that goes straight from pelekas village to Corfu town  so a 30 minute bus journey to the town  buses were timely. To conclude  it was a very pleasant stay! Thank you Kelly! Response from Kelly August 2016 Thank you very much for your great review! I'm sorry one of the fans was broken  if you had let me know I would have asked the cleaner to replace it. I'm glad that the water cutting out didn't affect your stay too much  apparently it has been happening all over the island this summer. I'm glad you enjoyed the apartment and Pelekas overall.

5941318,Richard July 2016 Great location to explore Corfu. Kelly was really helpful and gave great recommendations of things to do in the area. Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks for your review  glad you liked my recommendations and that you had a good time Kelly
5941318,Mara July 2016 I Response from Kelly July 2016 I'm sorry that the water went off. As I told you  the local council switch the water off when they are working on utilities and obviously I have no control over that. It would have been the same for the whole area not just our block. It doesn't happen very often you were just unfortunate in that regard. I hope you enjoyed your holiday apart from that issue. Kelly Show more
5941318,Katie July 2016 Kelly you couldnt have been more helpful! Our stay was fantastic! Thank you so much! Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks very much for your review  I'm glad you had a good time!
5941318,Hayley June 2016 Kelly is communicative and helpful and the apartment is great. It is tucked away on the hillside of Pelekas  in my opinion one of the best places to stay on Corfu. We enjoyed the walk to Pelekas beach as much as the beach itself  we didn't bother with the minibus. The charming village is up a steep hill but we are fit and it only took us 5 minutes. The apartment was well equipped and clean. The views from the balcony and bedroom are wonderful. Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks you for your very nice review.
5941318,Feyza May 2016 We really enjoyed our stay at the apartment and it exceeded our expectations in many ways. It was super conveniently located near the charming village of Pelekas with stunning views from the balcony overlooking the sea and mountains of Corfu. Kelly was a very responsive and gracious host. Response from Kelly May 2016 Thank you very much for your kind review  I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
5941318,Richard August 2015 We very much enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The neighbours were friendly and helpful and we very rarely had to share the large swimming pool with anyone. Location is perfect only a couple of minutes drive to Pelekas village or a short walk through the olive grove. There is a lovely breeze through the apartment during the day and stunning views over to Corfu Town and Albania from the balcony. The kitchen is small but adequate  hot water in the shower and fresh towels and bedding brought by the cleaner weekly. Comfortable bed  plenty of storage and the sofa downstairs can be converted so it can sleep four people comfortably. Highly recommended.
5941318,Sofia July 2022 Very nice contact person. Responded quickly. The pool is great. Translated from German  Show original
5941318,Oscar August 2019 The location is perfect for touring the whole island. And Pelekas is a village with all the amenities and cozy. Translated from Spanish  Show original
5941318,Sara August 2019 Great house located in the middle of the island so we had everything relatively close. Translated from Spanish  Show original
5941318,Guillaume October 2018 Beautiful apartment ideally located for visiting the whole island from north to south. Comfortable and well-equipped  check-in is allowed at any time with the very convenient lockbox. No complaints  everything was very good  excellent value for money! Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Jean-Luc September 2018 The pool and the view are nice but we were very disappointed with the amenities of the apartment which is very insufficient   I hope Kelly can correct this accumulation of small problems for who spoils the stay a little: no sunbeds or deckchairs (unlike the other apartments and the pool tiles are not very comfortable!)  no table on the balcony  the light from the balcony and landing was not working (I had to repair it on the balcony with difficulty because there is not even a stool)  the front door closes badly (obligation to lock it if you don't want to see it open on its own)  the refrigerator door does not close (it had to be stuck with an object)  the freezer door is set  zero shelves  no furniture to place or store things in the living room  we had to place them on the floor  no hooks in the apartment to hang clothes (not even in the room bath)  no chair  no bedside lamp in the bedroom  the box spring squeaks with the slightest movement  no oven or microwave to warm up dishes. No countertop to place dishes in the kitchen  a tiny Italian coffee maker (you can't make coffee for 2!)  only 2 forks!  no ironing table or mat  the outdoor washing machine is completely rusty  no hair dryer. Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Laura June 2018 Unfortunately  I can't say that the place is a good fit for a pleasant stay. The bathroom when we arrived was broken. The lockbox did not work properly and we were locked out at 11pm. The house is suitable for 2 people because it is very small  the refrigerator and kitchen old and rusty  as is the washing machine. There is no parking and it is far from the main road. Translated from Italian  Show original
5941318,Anton June 2018 We liked it. Translated from German  Show original
5941318,Sandrine September 2017 Kelly's place is even nicer in person than in photos and very clean. You will find everything you need to make your stay pleasant (cooking utensils  iron and others...like at home ) a nice pool always clean Kelly is very nice and available if needed. you have a shortcut on foot in front of the apartment that leads to the village of Pelekas 10 minutes away .

5941318,Hervé July 2017 The accommodation perfectly met our expectations (quiet location  nice view and sufficient services). The pool is a real plus. The rental is professional. For a perfect service  we can advise our host to change the mattress a little soft for our taste and the addition of mosquito nets even though many mosquito repellent spreaders are available. Do not hesitate to be made clear about the access that is difficult to find when you don't know Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Danielle September 2016 Spacious apartment  beautiful balcony and a large swimming pool. Location was also good  close to a nice village (10 min walk)  It could have been a little cleaner  sheets and towels were clean. Bathroom was a bit small and inconvenient  but fine for the two of us.  Translated from Dutch  Show original
5941318,Jade September 2016 Kelly is always in contact with us and always ready to answer questions quickly. Very nice accommodation with a swimming pool. We're glad you're here. Translated from French  Show original Response from Kelly September 2016 Thanks for your nice review
5941318,Elisabeth August 2016 We liked the apartment near Pelekas very much. It had everything you needed. There is also a clean pool where you can refresh yourself. The area is rather quiet  it takes ten to fifteen minutes to walk to Pelekas. To explore the island a rental car is perfect. Pelekas is close to the airport in central Corfu  so you can take a car to the south  sometimes to the north. The host  Kelly  was very keen to ensure that we had a smooth process. She was always approachable and we were well informed. All in all  a great apartment in a great area! Highly recommended! Translated from German  Show original Response from Kelly September 2016 Thanks very much for your nice review.
5941318,Marinte July 2016 It is a small but super nice apartment. From parking  it is a bit of a walk up. If you can't walk well  I just couldn't advise. It is quietly located  but close to the village! Balcony is lovely in the shade and has a beautiful view. We had a nice time there. Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks for your review
5941318,Maggie June 2016 What a lovely place. The apartment has a nice balcony where we enjoyed a magnificent view. I felt surrounded by natural beauty and the sound of the crickets. Swallows drinking from the pool and that was a special experience (so don't put on too much sunscreen). The pool is clean and nice. The place has something magical  we enjoyed it here. Kelly responds to every message quickly and kindly. Nothing's too much for her. The surroundings are great. Beautiful beaches and a cute village nearby. For the beaches you need a car. Please bring a mosquito net so the windows can open when it gets hot upstairs. I have particularly good memories of this place and we will definitely be back! Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Kelly June 2016 Thanks you for your lovely review  I'm glad you had a good time. Thanks for letting the apartment in very good condition  you are welcome back anytime and I have recommended you to other hosts. Kelly Show more

45191410,Sarah December 2022 We were on a walking holiday out of season. The flat was well located for the Corfu Trail. Just off the main square and close to a lovely bakery  a shop and small bar that were open out of season. The accommodation was comfortable and spacious. The kitchen had limited utensils but enough for pasta and sauce. The welcome we received was kind and warm. We arrived early but this was no problem.
45191410,Francesca September 2022 I would recommend this apartment highly   beautiful views and a very friendly village   hosts are very friendly and are on hand to help with any concerns or needs.
45191410,Sheena September 2022 Really nice apartment and good location! Response from Ελευθερια-Σπύρος October 2022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!
45191410,Ishan August 2022 a perfect vacation home  the owner is very helpful and flexible  room was clean and every description was accurate. We loved it.
45191410,Paola June 2022 The apartment is very well situated in Pelekas downtown  nearby a bakery ne good restaurants. But if you are looking for a place to stay several days  I would not recommend this town. It is far from the beach (accessible only by car) and it is very difficult to find a place to park the car.  The apartment was ok  but several things can be improved in the kitchen (old electrical stove  not easy to cook with it) and in the bathroom (water leaks and no shower curtain...) The room is very confortable and the air conditioner works very well. Beware that there are stairs to in and out from the appartement... not so practical if you need a easy access.
45191410,Marina October 2021 Elle hosted us in very last minute while the whole island was in danger for heavy rainfalls over the whole day   we were very thankful that we could stay in her cosy apartment which is in the old part of the village very central situated . We can recommend this place for hiking and walks to the beach ...
45191410,Imran September 2021 Amazing location. Access to a lot of restaurants  and beautiful views. Hard to get a bus to get around but nothing like a good cardio. wifi is my only complaint but we managed
45191410,Fanny September 2021 Cute appartement  very well located  in the middle of everything! Felt like a local !
45191410,Cristina September 2021 Elli was really nice and kind and the apartment is so cute!
45191410,Karolína August 2021 Nice apartment
45191410,Inês August 2021 Nice apartment right in the center of pelekas. Everything was well decorated  however the shower isn’t very practical.
45191410,Fabienne August 2021 Well located in a beautiful mountain village. Good infrastructure. Recommend.
45191410,Becca August 2021 All in all  a decent value for the money. Pelekas is a very cute village and the bnb is close to a lovely cafe  some great restaurants  and a nice bar. It is a HIKE down to and up from the beach  so I HIGHLY recommend renting a scooter or a car. The space is pretty chic and comfortable. The AC is in the living room and it was kind of difficult for it to cool down the bedroom. If you are sensitive to sound  the close by bar plays music until pretty late. The wifi was weak at around 0.5-2mbps. The nearby beaches are beautiful and have some beach bars/tavernas for food and drinks. I would recommend this place for budget travelers!
45191410,Merima August 2021 Pelekas is beautiful and the surrounding beach as well. The airbnb is comfortable and nice. We didn't cook anything there  so can't say much about that experience. There is a wonderful bakery right in front of the apartment for some breakfast or just a coffee to go :)  The host only accomodates the key exchange  so don't expect to receive some hospitality or anything like that. And also  there was music from the neighboring bar until 2 AM on both evenings (sat + sun) we were there so wasn't as quiet as I expected. But maybe this is just everywhere in Corfu.
45191410,Maïa July 2021 Very good location  the village is very Nice ! The apartement is lovely and clean. Maybe small for 4 people.
45191410,Altan July 2021 Nice apartment close to restaurants shops etc. Comfortable bed and good aircon
45191410,Gabriela July 2021 Really great host. Very responsive and helpful before we arrived. The apartment was as expected from the description and the photos  in an old building it has been beautifully renovated with a modern looking living /dining room and bedroom. Would definitely recommend to a couple  it has everything you need in a very good location. Kontogialos beach is a 3 minute drive and very close to Pelekas Square with a couple of cafés and bars.
45191410,Fatima June 2021 Great location & cute spot!
45191410,Spersa March 2021 It is a nice place in a traditional village  tastefully furniture and a nice and calm place to stay.
45191410,Matthew October 2020 So close to the village square with the cafe  the bakery and the grocery store. A good restaurant just a few metres up the hill too. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to get to know 'inner Corfu'.
45191410,Bronagh September 2020 This is such a beautiful apartment. Tastefully decorated and modern. It's a very pleasant space ideal for a single person or a couple. The location is perfect just a minutes walk from the square in Pelekas so close to all amenities  coffee shops  bars and the family also own the local supermarket so anything you might want is right there. If you need anything for the apartment they are only too happy to provide. Very nice family hosts. I would highly recommend and I will probably try to book it again next time I come - it its available as I guess it will be very popular. Ten out of ten!

45191410,Marina October 2022 THE ROOM NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT. LIKE A LOCATION IT'S VERY NICE. BUT OUR STAY WASN'T AS EXPECTED. THE MATTRESS IS BELOW THE MEASURE   THERE WERE NO BASIC AMENITIES LIKE A SHOWER CURTAIN WITH THE EFFECT OF FILLING WATER OUT OR WE COULD NOT COLLECT THEM AS THERE WAS NO MOANING.

45191410,Olaf June 2022 Very good location right on the main square and at the church in Pelekas. In the apartment  the living room is very nicely decorated with a great picture as an eye-catcher. The bedroom is also very nice with a very nice view of the square and the church. However  the kitchen is not so well equipped and the fridge is quite old. The bathroom is missing a shower curtain. Nevertheless  we felt comfortable and the check-in was very straightforward and friendly. Translated from German  Show original
45191410,Dominik May 2022 Good accommodation in central location of Pelekas. Value for money was great. Amenities in the kitchen a bit low; but sufficient for preparing breakfast. On Friday  the music from the street was already very loud. Cleanliness was a bit tricky as there is a lot of animal hair on the carpets. Translated from German  Show original
45191410,Thomas October 2021 Very well located apartment. In the lively village  next to everything  restaurants  bars  grocery store  10 minutes' walk from the top of the mountain where you can see the whole island at 360 it's incredible. The apartment is simple. Bathroom and basic kitchen. Mattress too soft for our taste. The wifi was great. The views are stunning. Translated from French  Show original

45191410,Simone September 2020 Very nice and modern place to stay. Unfortunately  the bed is a bit uncomfortable - but that's a matter of taste - as you like. The shower is a bit unfortunate - when showering you flood the bathroom. A rubber puller would be beneficial here. But all in one great place to stay. Nice bars/restaurants/bakers nearby. Even a minimal sea view gives the room. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Jana October 2022 Theo is an extremely accommodating and helpful host. We booked our stay in the morning and checked in by the afternoon. Although Theo was not at home  he handled everything with us remotely. The house is charming  the location wonderful  beautiful garden and fantastic views  well equipped kitchen. You need to bring a car but there are several restaurants  bakeries  shops and everything you need right in the village. The nearest beach is about 1 5 km  so 30min walk  but 5 min by car.
25457177,Roberta July 2022 Intimate and really cute studio  perfect for a couple.. the garden and the outside spaces were wonderful. Theo is really friendly  attentive and available. The position is really good  just 10 minutes from Glyfada and Kontogialos. Recommended!
25457177,Augustė April 2022 We are really pleased with our stay in this little studio apartment! We arrived at the time of Greek Easter  the hosts were really kind to share their festive foods with us. The apartment had fresh lavanders in the vase which make the guests feel welcome  and the garden view… breathtaking! I would definately recommend this studio for a couple that wishes to have a cozy place for a very affordable price.
25457177,Dimitrios September 2021 excellent accomodations. good family business . I highly recommend it.
25457177,Sofie July 2021 That was a really great stay at an amazing accomodation. The localisation is great and really chill. Theo  the host  is always available to help and really welcoming and friendly !
25457177,Yishai July 2021 We had a wonderful stay  the place is beautiful and in a great location. Theofilos and his family were very friendly and helpful. Thank you! Highly recommended

25457177,Paul May 2021 Great Location for work- or vacation :) It's quiet and peaceful with great views all around. But you can also reach most other parts of the island within a 20-30 minute (scenic) drive. Theo and his family are welcoming and even let me stay in a bigger apartment since the tourist season had not really started. 5 stars!
25457177,Oleksii September 2019 We stayed in a studio room  which is small at the first sight but actually it's size is perfect if you don't plan to stay in the room for long time. We had our meals at the terrace which is really cozy. The AC is a fan in reality but it does it's job  so it wasn't hot there (in August-September). Just make sure to leave the windows open.  The village itself is really great. We explored the island by car  and seen a lot of other places  so we know what we're saying. :) It has local heritage and everything you might need is there. The nearest beaches are also really nice. The one we enjoyed the most of them is Gyaliskari.  Perfect place to stay. Kerkira is close  nice beaches near and it's a great starting point for your trips around the island. Just rent a car. By the way the parking spot is right near the house and always has places which is a great bonus.  We wouldn't hesitate to book the same place the next time we'll be on Corfu. :)
25457177,Isabel October 2018 We had a great time in Pelekas at the house of Theofilos. The room was clean and tidy  even very late check - in was possible  very kind hosts  great terrace and garden. Because of the location it's a perfect choice for those who don't want to stay in the city  but also like to explore the island. Ask for an route description in advance :)
25457177,Patrice September 2018 Good place  calm and beautiful. Studio has a good quality/price ratio. Corfou has several beautiful places to visit  some beautiful beaches. Corfou has also lot of tourists  so sometimes like in kerkyra or paleokastritsa  you really have the feeling to be à tourist  for price and for relation ship. When doing abstraction of this  you can spend some good Time. My advice  avoid summer monthes and go far from Big cities.
25457177,Pascal November 2022 Well-located rental  simple but sufficient for what was expected. The location makes it easy to travel around the island. We're never more than an hour away from the sites. Special mention for the many very cuddly cats that often come to visit us. The rental met our expectations. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,"Teresa October 2022 Pleasant contact  quick answers and great suggestions on what and where to go. The location and the house are beautiful and away from the tourist troubles  which is very pleasant. Kaisers Throne is within walking distance  and so are the beaches. If you have time to drive a little further away  the restaurant in the southwest of Corfu (Argirades) ""El cielo"" is highly recommended!!! Great to connect with a trip to Paxos Translated from German  Show original"
25457177,Zina August 2022 The room was fine-but the landlord writes on his side that it's close to the beach. It's not. It was 2km up on a mountain  which made it impossible to get to the beach without a car. He had plenty of cats  we had to throw out of our apartment many times. So I think a little more accurate description was missing Translated from Danish  Show original
25457177,Rebeca July 2022 Very friendly and helpful. Cozy apartment with amazing views. We do not recommend renting it without a car as buses do not pass by when they should. Otherwise everything was correct  well located within the small town. Translated from Spanish  Show original
25457177,Guillaume July 2022 Very well located location on the island  20 min drive from the city center  also easy to visit north and south of the island from this place. Cat lovers will be delighted to have a dozen cats living in the garden. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,Giovanna July 2022 Pelekas is a very nice and quiet country. It's worth staying here  especially since you can visit the whole island without crossing too many mountains. The apartment is very nice and has everything you need. Beautiful garden and full of very polite cats. Recommended:) Translated from Italian  Show original
25457177,Hanna May 2022 Great location to the beach and also some good taverns are within walking distance! Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Lisa May 2022 Nice place and location to stay  with a nice garden and very friendly host. Don't expect much from the studio  for two adults with two suitcases it is very small  but the price is also to that. It's quite noisy and the humidity rate is high. If you plan to not be in the apartment much and love basic this is a great place to stay. It is a good base to explore all the places of the beautiful island! Translated from Dutch  Show original
25457177,Katharina October 2021 The property is in a great location for excursions on the island. To the city 20 minutes and to various beaches about 10 minutes each by car.

25457177,Alisa August 2020 A great airbnb with a wonderful view of the ocean. The hosts were super nice and always helped us with questions. The room (studio) in itself is small but nice and perfect for 2 people. The shower was a bit uncomfortable and you had to get used to it but nothing that somehow stands out as super negative. We are very satisfied! A little tip: take mosquito spray with you! This makes your vacation a little more relaxed ;). Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Joop August 2020 Great Airbnb. Super location in a very pleasant neighborhood with some restaurants and not far to the beach. Theo's mother welcomed us and was very accommodating. We were able to approach them with all our questions. All in all highly recommended! ((: Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Daniel August 2020 Fantastic location  very nice people.  The location was almost perfect because it was quite centrally located. Be sure to book a rental car! This accommodation is perfect for seeing as much of Corfu as possible  we drove good 500 kilometers in 7 days. The accommodation only served as a sleeping space and it was sufficient for that. By car  you have the choice to be at least 3 different beaches within 5 minutes  also the old town and the airport are only 25 minutes away by car.  Only the cleanliness of the rooms had air upstairs. Hair in the bathroom on arrival is a no-go  but it may also not be seen so tightly in the area (Pelekas). Still  it can't be. Had it not been for the location and we would have occupied the accommodation more  it would not have received 4 stars for this.  Otherwise great  also super nice people (mother & son).

25457177,Shirani September 2019 We spent 10 days at the house Lemoni at the end of September. The studio is very small but has everything you need. The garden overlooking the sea is beautiful  and we also totally liked Pelekas with its many small tavernas and great views. You can walk to the beach (Pelekas Beach) for about half an hour and there is a bus connection to Corfu town. But to see a little more of the island  a scooter or rental car makes sense. We didn't meet Theo during our stay  but his parents and many little baby cats:) We felt very comfortable and would definitely come back! Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Joanna September 2019 Small apartment  but suitable for two. A large patio next to an old tree. There's a family of cats in the house. There were 11 of them! Stunning sea views and verdant cliffs. Scenic drives down about 1-1.5 miles to a beautiful beach. Translated from Polish  Show original

25457177,Thelma July 2019 The accommodation and location are pleasant. Easy access by bus. Good value for money. Only the accommodation is very humid  there are many cats in front of the door who try to get in and bathroom a little disappointing. However  the village is very nice and despite an absent host  the person who opened us was very pleasant. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,Nina June 2019 The studio in the house Lemoni was very nice and cozy  everything you need was there  and we also liked to sit in the sun loungers in front of the house overlooking the sea or on the terrace in front of the studio. The village of Pelekas is also very nice and we got around Corfu even without a rental car. The accommodation is for people who like it quiet and who like to share a double bed. The studio is small  but you don't need more space. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Annerose & Werner October 2018 Very tastefully decorated. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Claudia September 2018 Small but with all the essentials! The studio has an outdoor area with a coffee table where you can eat and the area is very quiet  close to restaurants  a few kilometers from the sea and central to the island. Translated from Italian  Show original

49740616,Flora July 2022 Beautiful spot  super nice hosts  comfortable beds  the terrace is perfect and our baby could crawl all over the place. The beach is great  clean and beautiful. Our kids loved it. It is quite a busy spot and you can hear the music from the bar next door which was a little loud at times. But they turned it off early. Alltogether a very good experience!
49740616,Siya June 2022 Very nice house located at the beach of Kontogialos. All necessities are available. The hosts are friendly and nice. Good value for money.
49740616,Tibor September 2021 If this were in California  it would be Malibu. The house stands right at the sandy beach on the hill which makes this apartment very unique. A narrow private access leads the hill down to the parking. Bars and tavernas offer food and drink  and also you can rent umbrellas and sun beds. Those you like karaoke  the neighbouring bar is very close.
49740616,Hanna September 2021 Thank you for a perfect holiday with a warm welcome  and an outstanding spot with great views and private beach access. Swimming before breakfast in cristall clear water and fruits from the garden make it especially nice.
49740616,Julien August 2022 Very nice apartment facing the beach. The view is magnificent and close to this one (max 50 meters by a private path.)  The access road to the apartment is a peak by car and 30 minutes from the airport and the city of Corfu so it is well located.  The air conditioning and internet are functional. Linens and towels are provided on request without charge. The owners live right above so it's quite simple for check-in.  When it comes to areas to improve: a sunbed on the terrace would be great  the essentials deserve to be more  such as toilet paper  dishwashing products to last for the duration of your stay.  it should be noted that the nearby beach bars are noisy some days / evenings but it is sumptuous. I recommend  it. 😀 Show more Translated from French  Show original
49740616,Franziska August 2022 Fantastic location! The apartment is right on the beach  so we could fall asleep to waves. There is everything you need  even an air conditioner and mosquito nets on all the windows and doors. Communication worked out well and went very quickly. We were very warmly welcomed and would come back any time. Translated from German  Show original
49740616,Marco July 2022 Apartment perfect for family with two children. Direct access to the sea  just 50 meters away! Obviously beautiful sea view. Sparkling clean. Welcoming and friendly guests… Great cake from the hostess! Translated from Italian  Show original
49740616,Christelle May 2022 we had a great time. the rental is very good and clean . our plane was taking off late at night . and the owner allowed us to stay longer . the owner's sister is on site . She's very nice . the sea is 30 meters from the house . i recommend this rental . There is everything nearby  small market   restaurant  etc. Translated from French  Show original
49740616,Khaty May 2022 Really adorable hospitality and presence 🙏The Greek hospitality of lovely hosts is waiting for you  and the place is unique! Tavernas and a supermarket nearby. Everything is perfect! Ps: You need a car ( the climbs are steep!) Translated from French  Show original
50923824,Rūta September 2022 Our family of 4 people stayed in apartament B  it is two bedroom apartament with seperate kitchen. Everything was clean  spacious kitchen  view frim the terase to the sunset  beautiful simple greek house. House owners are greeks they dont speek english but we used translator and everyting we needed we got it. They let to grill on tje terace. The best thing about the house is the location 5-7 min walk down the hill to the nice and calm beach. 2 min to the local shop:)
50923824,Marc September 2022 Nice patio with nice view  short walk to beach  store 2 min away  clean place  friendly caretakers speaking Greek. No inside place to sit except kitchen. No kitchen extras like salt & pepper or anything. Kitchen equipment basic Beds are fine  fairly firm. Good value.
50923824,Nick June 2022 Tonia  who is the host at the property  was incredibly warm and kind. The place is clean and tidy. The shower is a sit down shower situation  and I used the outdoor public shower more often.  If you don't hire a motorcycle or car prepare to do a lot of walking up and down steep narrow roads. (A 50cc scooter will not make it up the hill with two people). You can walk to the beach from Tonia's. It's a beautiful and popular beach  with a lot of people and can be noisey. There are quieter and just as beautiful  if not more  a short drive/ride or a decent walk..
50923824,Maren June 2022 Really friendly So close to the beach Super nice Trasse
50923824,Miriam June 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at the appartement Tonia. Pelakas Beach is a really beautiful  quiet place with a wonderful beach. The appartement is also quite nice. Particularly  the terrace has a wonderful view of the ocean. The beach is a five minute walk away. We recommend to rent a car. The owners are very kind. They only speak Greek  so communication was a but difficult at times  however  we it still worked with gestures and google translate. The windows are equipped with window screens but the kitchen rather sparsely equipped. Via Airbnb it is not possible to communicate with the hosts of the apartment. You could also book the trip directly at the homepage of the Tonia Appartment in pelekas beach. All in all we really recommend this place if you are for a quiet and relaxing vacation.
50923824,Anna September 2021 The apartment is 10 minutes walk from the beautiful beach and there is also a supermarket located 5 minutes walk. The apartment is well equipped  we did not miss there anything important. The terrace is spacious and the view is amazing. Response from Your.Rentals September 2021 Thank you so much for your kind words. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. We look forward to seeing you again in the future!
50923824,Adi August 2021 Well located above wonderful Pelekas beach  very clean  amenities lacks a little (make sure A/C is working and hot water cattle there). Bottom line good value for price Response from Your.Rentals August 2021 Thank you for taking the time to write your feedback. We have informed the homeowner of your review and will follow up accordingly. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention. We will try to improve our service and hope that we can have another chance to work with you in the future with our best. Show more

18354099,Victoria October 2022 We really enjoyed our stay here. The room is light and airy and has pretty much everything you need. Location is great just outside the main village square. We would come back!
18354099,Krystian August 2022 Everything was great. Communication with Vasileios (owner) was very good and the view was brilliant.
18354099,Kyrylo August 2022 Great place  everything was according to the description. All necessities provided. No a/c  but the temperature inside was comfortable even with 33° outside. The closest beach is 2km far  with elevation difference of about 150m.
18354099,Jane July 2022 Lovely little studio perfect stay with wonderful hosts who were so kind  and very helpful during our stay. Jane & Alison
18354099,Taras June 2022 We had amazing holiday. We appreciate Vasileios about his hospitality and generosity. Also we really thankful for excellent service!
18354099,Oezcan June 2022 Everything was excellent. Vassilis is a great host! Thank you a lot and hopefully see you again!
18354099,Abdullatif May 2022 Vasileios was really nice and the studio was clean. He thought about everything and always answered very quickly when we had questions. I can only recommend. Perfect Airbnb experience
18354099,Margaux May 2022 Really spacious and lovely studio  5 min walk from village center streets! The best part were the hosts. They were great with communication and so kind! We were even given a ride to the airport. Vasileios also has a lovely shop in the village where he sells his art!!! Would definitely come back here :)
18354099,Barbora August 2021 Studio in Pelekas was huge. It is just on the main road from Pelekas and some evenings and nights was disturbed by people leaving on noisy motorbikes. There is no climatization. But whole day the sun doesn't shine in the windows  so the temperature is stable and bearable. Place was really clean  beach towels were great. You find there everything you need for your vacation. Due to Covid  we haven't met Vasileios  but the communication was always fast and exact. Beach is by foot cca 30 minutes downhill. It is cca 2-3 km.
18354099,Lisa August 2021 Vasilis apartment is clean and spacious. Many useful things like beach towels  a parasol  mosquito lamps .. are provided and also additional Covid-safety measures are taken to make the guests feel safe. The apartment is located in Pelekas town. Many good restaurants can be reached within a 5 minute walking distance. Pelekas Beach and Glyfada Beach are located down the hill (30 minutes walk). The way up is quite steep  so you might consider renting a car. Vasilis is a great host. He always replied quickly to our messages  recommended a taxi driver and told us a lot about Pelekas. You should visit him in his shop in Pelekas center where he sells his beautiful handcrafted art. We had a nice stay and definitely recommend the place. Response from Vasileios August 2021 Thank you very much for so warm words! It will be pleasure to see you again!
18354099,Adrian August 2021 The studio is good located  at the end of the Pelekas village  close to the main street  so in the morning it can be a little bit noisy  starting 7 a.m. The studio is so spacious that it sounds echoed. Although we appreciated the fact that is well equipped  clean and very close to Glyfada  Mirtiotissa and Kontogialos beaches and Corfu Town also.
18354099,Matthieu August 2021 A great accommodation in a very nice town. Vasileios is very helpful. Thank you !
18354099,Bela September 2020 Spacious room and nice location. Was a nice experience and my host made sure my questions were answered quickly.

18354099,Rania August 2020 We really enjoyed our stay. Vasileios and his wife are really nice people even if we get the chance to meet only his wife Elena. The apartment is spacious and very clean close to many tavernas with nice greek food. Vasileios was always available for all our requests. Thank you. I totally recommend and we would defenetly come back there.
18354099,Petr August 2020 We had a great time in this apartment. Everything was as described. Even there's no air-condition there was comfortable temperature inside. Vassilis is easy going guy and helped us with all things we needed. Totally recommend.
18354099,Gemma November 2019 The studio is in an ideal location  surrounded by stunning views. Inside has all the amenities to provide a comfortable stay whilst in Pelekas. Vasilis and his wife Elena are superb hosts and checked on us during our stay to ensure everything was going well. We hope to return soon and have recommended the studio to friends.
18354099,Dominik September 2019 Studio was absoltelly perfect and Vassilis as well. Great location. Studio was clean  nice  there was literally everything what you need to have and some extra stuff. Vassilis went for us to the airport and also gave us a lift back. He Gave us many tips for trips and arranged to rent a scooter right in Pelekas. I can definitelly recommend this studio!
18354099,Till September 2019 The place is very spacious  with everything you need to cook etc.  and has a nice terrace outside where you can hang out. The walk down to the beach is about 25 minutes (if you don't have a vehicle)  and it's really a nice beach. Vassilis is supernice and knows a lot of storys about the town  he also picked us up at the bus station  we're very happy to have met him.
18354099,Alain Et Valerie August 2019 don't hesitate to go to Vassili home it is well located  quiet  very clean and Vasiily is a super Host thanks to his tips we have discovered Corfu in a wonderful way we recommend Response from Vasileios September 2019 Thank you for your warm words! We will be glad to see you again any time!
18354099,Giovanni August 2019 Vassilis and his wife were extremely efficients and kind to us. The location is great  not far away from the capital  such a charming small town! The apartment is very cosy  comfortable  spacious and very well full equipped. A pleasant space to stay!
18354099,Anne-Claire August 2019 We had a great time in Pelekas  the village is really cute and beautiful. Vassilis is an extraordinarily nice host  always ready to help and to give you tips about the best spots and where to go. I gladly recommand staying at Vassilis’.
18354099,Philippe August 2019 A great experience ! The studio is wonderful  quiet  spacious  with a nice view on hills around Corfou.

An address highly recommandable... Response from Vasileios August 2019 Philippe  thank you for your so warm words! It will be lovely to see you again!
18354099,Taras July 2019 Vassilis is a wonderful host! Very friendly  pick us up from a bus stop  provided quick tour through the village and was really helpful during our stay. Apartment’s location is very convenient  at the end of the village  but not that far from it’s center. About 20 min to the nearest beach by foot  although walk back up the hill could be a bit tiresome  so better to rent some vehicle. The nearest tavern is really close  but we didn’t hear any noise from it  and even though apartment is close to the road  traffic isn’t that big and wasn’t bothering. Response from Vasileios August 2019 Thank you for your warm words! It`s will be pleasure to see you again!
18354099,Sarah June 2019 The accommodation was fantastic. Ideal location for the town and a 20 min walk to the beach. It is great value and a fantastic sized apartment. Vassilis was a great host.He let us know of local festivals and events  even going as far to give us a lift there. Nearby is a great little family owned supermarket called Sophie’s which had everything we needed. We would highly Vassilis apartment. A special find.
18354099,Niclas September 2018 Vasillis was the host that everybody wants. He always responded immediatly and had a lot of great tips both for pelekas and korfu in general. He even picked us up from the bus station to bring us to our Apartment and the checkin was very flexibel. The studio itself was very clean and even bigger then i thought. The only thing i missed was w-lan but compared to Vasillis as a host and the studio itself its a little issue. I recommend this apartment to everyone that want to see the beautiful village pelekas and korfu in general.
18354099,Sandrine August 2018 We enjoyed so much our stay at Pelekas!!! Vassilis and his wife Elena were so helpful  they are always available to explain the beaches  and places to visit. They are very pleasant people! The studio is spaceful  with all that we need for a good stay! Pelekas is a charming small town. We rent a scooter to visit around Pelekas  good choice!

18354099,Maksim July 2018 Communication with Vassilis and his family  their responsiveness and friendliness  their hospitality are something absolutely outstanding! That was our best communication airbnb experience for sure. As for the studio - it’s quite spacious and it has everything you need. It’s really fresh in there  so the conditioner is not needed indeed. The window view is picturesque! Especially the sunset. As for the location  there’re 2 main beaches around the place  but they are 20-30 minutes walking away  so if you are not a fan of long-distance walking  I would advice to rent a bike or a car. So  all in all  that was an amazing stay  thank you  Vassilis for everything  nice to meet you and your family  and to spend these days at your place!
18354099,Jérémy July 2018 We had a great stay in pelekas. The studio is really nice and clean. Vassilis was a great host and gave us many local information about beaches  transports  restaurants ...

18354099,Florence September 2022 Very spacious studio and matches the photos. Vassilis is charming and very responsive  available if needed and ready to chat and give information on where to go. The only downside is that the wifi is super slow. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Rocco September 2022 very comfortable house  every comfort available  very helpful hosts...to return for sure Translated from Italian  Show original
18354099,Katrin September 2022 Very comfortable and comfortable place to stay with a nice host. The morning is busy when the windows are open  but nothing to do. Translated from Czech  Show original

Vasileios was very available and always friendly  my girlfriend and I also needed extra time for check-in and the owner was very helpful. Highly recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
18354099,Evelyne June 2022 A well functional apartment to shine by car and visit all Corfu in a lively village. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Thomas September 2021 well suited for a night if you are on the Corfu Trail  the accommodation is right on the path and it is only 5 minutes to the village center! Translated from German  Show original
18354099,Thierry September 2021 great and see you soon Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Olivier September 2021 Very functional apartment  ideally a place to travel around the island. It's very easy to park in front of the apartment  which is a real plus in Corfu ! The village has all amenities including in super sorcierge store !! Recommended Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Françoise July 2021 A little sad place  no views. Pélekas is not recommended for non-motorized guests (no buses to the beach). Too bad it's a typical village. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Aurélien September 2020 Very good for a short stay Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Julia August 2020 The studio is very large  with a high ceiling  making it very spacious and keep it cool even in August which is a real pleasure ! When we arrived  the cleaning had just been done  everything was very clean. The location is ideal for walking to the beach (note: the return is going up !) or going pretty much anywhere you want by car (not far from Corfu  or Paleokastritsa for example). The village itself is very nice  with bars and taverns  and a magnificent sunset from the throne of Kaiser at the very top of the hillside of the village. I would recommend staying here without so much as a second thought  and would stay here again ! Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Constance August 2020 A great value for money for this quiet studio  on the heights of the charming village of Pelekas. I can only recommend : the studio is large  perfectly clean and the hosts are charming and responsive! Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Suzon August 2020 We had a lovely stay in pelekas. Very well located accommodation at the end of the village towards the beaches. The studio is large  well-equipped and close to amenities. Highly recommend ! Translated from French  Show original

18354099,Damien September 2018 The apartment is conveniently located in Pelekas  Vasilis is very welcoming and attentive. It is a large studio with a small balcony and all the basic amenities. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Izah September 2018 Perfect host and great kindness!! We had a great time talking to each other. He is a very generous person. The apartment is impeccable. We have everything we need.

Translated from French  Show original

18354099,Marine August 2017 The best trip  simply. An extraordinary welcome in a quiet but lively village  near the best beaches on the island and the best restaurants. A lot of people come back  and that's right. We'll be back  too! Translated from French  Show original Response from Vasileios August 2017 Thank you for everything! It was nice to meet you and we will be glad to see you again!
25901645,Диана August 2022 The apartment is small enough in case you want to cook it doesn't have a kitchen. Furthermore  the tableware were all dirty  after previous guests they were not washed. There is no iron in the apartment  as stated in the description. We could iron things in a nearby hotel. The hostess is a nice woman  but it takes a long time to respond to messages. Near the apartment there is a supermarket and several bars.
25901645,Steven & Denise August 2022 Central in the mountain village of Pelekas  not far from Kerkyra town. No cooking facilities in the small apartment  but good for a short stay. Water supply occasionally interrupted in the village  but this can be accommodated!
25901645,Sophia July 2022 Nice & clean place. Would totally recommend. No warm water and the toilet flush didn’t worked the first days but got fixed. Amazing Mountain View. Lovely village with nice restaurants  bars and bakerys.
25901645,Angela July 2022 Very nice small apartment in the middle of Pelekas. Host very nice.
25901645,Haris September 2021 A very basic apartment  substantially clean  good enough for a short affordable stay.
25901645,Iulia July 2021 The owner is very nice. the apartment is very beautiful and in a quiet area. There are many shops nearby and restaurants with tasty food. The beach is relatively close and beautiful. The water is very clean and the view is wonderful.
25901645,Maryna August 2019 This flat is very nice. We really enjoyed this vacation in village Pelekas.
25901645,Никита August 2019 Nice cosy flat. Very clean. One thing to improve is WiFi. Good choice for reasonable price.
25901645,Heather May 2019 We stayed for one night whilst walking the Corfu Trail. We collected the keys from the mini market in the main square. The accommodation was nearby and wonderfully unique.
25901645,Bruce March 2019 Pelekas is magical. The apartment is perfect.  just not good if you want to cook.
25901645,VAsily March 2019 Great location with amazing view from the window.
25901645,Ward September 2018 The room is small but conveniened. Airconditioning Works great. We used it while walking the Corfu trail to have a nice night of sleep. That is exactly what we have got
25901645,Ermal August 2018 It is a comfortable apartment in Pelekas (a really nice Greek town in Corfu) the only problem we have it was the water not working some days and the toilet paper that was not enough. For the rest everything ok.
25901645,Peter October 2022 It seemed difficult to receive us. It went by phone and then through the husband who didn't like much and didn't know anything. We wouldn't have to leave until 11: 00 a.m.  but at 10: 00 a.m.  the cleaning lady was at the door to get us out. although not the cheapest  it was the least of the apartments we visited in Corfu Translated from Dutch  Show original
25901645,Sandrine August 2022 Very well located in Pelekas but dark apartment  medium quality of bedding  not suitable for eating... value for money not agreed Translated from French  Show original
25901645,Luuk August 2022 Perfect small but cozy village with everything you need. In the evening also choice of several cozy terraces. Were also received very kindly. Apartment is small  but if you only use it for sleeping it is perfect. Translated from Dutch  Show original
25901645,Tobias June 2022 Super accommodation with an excellent location. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Jakub August 2021 Time is running out. The photos are misleading and don't accurately represent the space. It was dirty and scary  and we had to cancel. Zero respect for the guest  even though Agnes was sorry and explained why it's so dirty  it's still not worth the stress or the relief. Pelekas is better to come from Corfu for a day and stay here. Translated from Polish  Show original
25901645,Jennifer August 2021 Beautiful place with fantastic sunsets. The room was cozy  only if you like to cook for yourself there is no kitchen there. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Aspa August 2021 Very difficult to communicate  unfortunately we had a day out of 3 when we were staying off of water. It didn't have all the amenities she wrote (hair dryer and iron). The village of Pelekas is very beautiful and close to Κέρκυρα about 15 min by car. Translated from Greek  Show original
25901645,Garage August 2021 An inexpensive and very typical place with all the things that it implies. Nevertheless  it is well located but we will not go back. Translated from French  Show original
25901645,Nawid August 2021 Just great!!! Really for a great holiday just the right thing. A small cute village with very nice people and a very family flair. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Franz August 2019 At the appointed time  we were unable to check in yet as the guests had not previously checked out on time. As a compensation  there was free coffee at Agnes's restaurant. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner and unfortunately it was not cleaned in between as promised. Everything else went well  there was even free Tzatziki :) Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Raffaella August 2019 Very nice apartment  convenient for check-in. Small but comfortable house  great location in a characteristic landscape!! Translated from Italian  Show original
25901645,Tiphaine September 2018 The village of Pelekas is very cute  the locals are lovely and do not hesitate to help us if needed. On the other hand  our host was not the one described when booking. The welcome was short and cold. As our stay went  the host relaxed and we discovered a nice person. The only problem was that the bathroom was not perfectly clean and that the apartment lacked accessories such as toilet paper. Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Lorna September 2022 Myself and my friend had the most wonderful stay here! Debbie and Tony were so welcoming  friendly and helpful. They have made this place so beautiful- we especially loved the view from the treehouse with a glass of Debbie’s homemade wine!! There is also a lovely spot for yoga and mats to use- we enjoyed doing this at sunrise. The beach is near but down quite a big hill so we would recommend hiring bikes or a car if you can. The town nearby  Pelekas  is also very pretty- we enjoyed cocktails in a bar called Zanzibar which was recommended to us by Tony. The Olive Grove Oasiss was a great find and I would completely recommend visiting. I can’t wait to come back soon! Thank you Debbie and Tony :)
50701568,Johannes September 2022 Debbie's place was the perfect choice for us! Each corner was build with love and you can see her own signature everywhere ;) I'd definitely recommend this place to people who want to calm down for a couple of days.
50701568,Majai September 2022 Well  where do I start.... If you are after a place that will bring comfort  joy and peace and stillness this is the place for you. If you are after an amazing  caring  open  thoughtful host that will stay with you on the phone until 2am to help you find the place even though she was at the hospital with her son this is the place for you ( getting there at night  and being left by the taxi driver at the wrong place made it confusing). Very easy to find during the day. If you want a very clean  comfortable bed and cooking and cleaning facilities this is the place. It is something you must experience to understand. Do not go there and give bad review because of the hills and silly things like that. Pelekas and Corfu in general and overall are just wonderful. Will definitely return and strongly recommend!
50701568,Max September 2022 wasn't able to stay the full length unfortunately however the short stay we had was amazing
50701568,Hussein August 2022 Staying at debbie's was an amazing experience.. she created a simple but beautiful campsite that will give you a memorable and enjoyable experience.. thank you debbie for your great hospitality :D
50701568,Julius August 2022 Debbie is a very warm hostess who is always available with advice and tips. Everything was incredibly uncomplicated. It is a beautiful place to relax.
50701568,Clara August 2022 Beautiful stay in corfu  waking up to a olive branches and the smell of summer. Even in high season the island is stunning and charming  and Debbie’s place is just great. Pelekas is small and cosy with some great places to eat (we especially enjoyed Alexandros). We didn’t rent a vehicle but instead took to hiking to the beaches of our choice which was fine for us  but corfu is hilly and getting around is not so easy so if possible rent a car or scooter:)
50701568,Milica July 2022 Debbie is a very welcoming host. She will give you lots of local tips  taste of local food and wine and make you feel like at home. Space is very nice and every detail is nicely arranged. View from the view tower is amazing. We could only use more light in the evening along the path to the tent. Beware not to follow Google instructions when trying to reach the place  it could lead you on a longer and quite a bad road.
50701568,Gabriella Holmen July 2022 We had a great time at Debbie’s. The campground was great with everything you needed  plus her and her family were really nice. The views and surroundings of the place were beautiful and non-touristy which was great - then you could always go to the more touristy parts if you wanted to. It was a bit hot to stay in a tent when you are here during a heatwave and the crickets are quite loud  when you are going to sleep  but it is nothing a couple of ear plougs can’t handle. All and all a really great (and different) stay  that we would highly recommend others to try out :-)
50701568,Luise July 2022 Debbie was the best host and the location was absolutely beautiful
50701568,Karlijn July 2022 Debbie and the whole campsite are amazing! They’re very welcoming and friendly and the place is so unique. We loved the lookout tower  the passionate way Debbie talks about the whole area and the small details the stay has. Would 10/10 recommend!
50701568,Stanislas July 2022 We recommand the place for a different kind of stay. The bed is confortable  and the coffe on a platform ion a tree is a delight :)
50701568,Filip June 2022 My boyfriend and I loved the place and the amazing hosts. Can’t thank this family enough! Unfortunately  I got sick during our short stay but Debbie and Toni did everything so I could get better. They called a doctor to check up on me  Debbie was in contact with us at all times and prepared a delicious Greek soup and baklava for us. To get that sick in a foreign country can be scary but with their help I was as good as new in 2days! Wish I could have been able to enjoy the amazing beaches nearby and the stunning views for longer! I can’t recommend this place enough!
50701568,Wilken June 2022 Debbie and her family are fantastic hosts and have a beautiful camping ground with a lot of great details. We would come back any time!
50701568,Elisabeth June 2022 Really nice persons and on complete disposal for every kind of need.
50701568,Regina June 2022 The perfect place to stay in Corfu if you are looking for some quie  nature and authentic people. Debbie  Tony and Nicholas are wonderful hosts who will provide you with all the information and recommendations you mught need and make you feel welcome and at home from the first minute.
50701568,Cassidy May 2022 This is an experience like no other!! I’ll start off by saying Debbie and Nicholas were the most incredible hosts - so kind and accommodating and gave us some amazing local recommendations! Truly wonderful people who made us feel immediately at home.  We had the most wonderful stay in this tent  and the bed is the most comfortable we have slept on anywhere in Greece so far! Having morning coffee and painting rocks with wine in the afternoon in the lookout tower was truly magical. Tucked in the trees on the side of the hill  this place is truly an oasis.  The site offers everything you could ever need  with a shower  fully stocked kitchen and even a running water toilet! The facilities are all shared with other guests but we never had any trouble with accessing anything. (Just remember to label your food / drinks  we had bought a nice bottle of bubbles that one of the other guests enjoyed while we were in town!)  We had a car and the site has a a good size parking space. Also the town of Pelekas was amazing! It’s a smaller less touristic town with many restaurants and the food we had here was fantastic.  I can’t recommend this stay enough  it is a true gem and the hosts are the most wonderful people. I would stay again in a heart beat if I make it back to Corfu in the future! Show more
50701568,Bianca September 2021 It’s the best stay you can have! Debbie is such a wonderful welcoming host creating a magical vibe at this place. No matter what she‘s there for you and tries to help you out. She even brings home cooked food every day. The area is in the middle of the nature with a breathtaking view. We felt so connected and rooted  enjoyed the tent feeling with the bed inside to the fullest. Highly recommended :)
50701568,Malika September 2021 The place is full of kindness  just like the hosts. Beautiful nature to enjoy and the close village (Pelekas) is also very beautiful. The closest beaches are nice too. So we can only fully recommend! Thank you Debbie and Tony :)
50701568,Daniel August 2021 Absolutely fantastic experience  cannot recommend any stronger. Debbie is a great host who really cares about your stay and makes sure everything goes smoothly. The campsite has wonderful views and is only 20 mins walk/5 min drive from the nearest beach. Kitchen/toilets are fully equipped. We were also concerned about the heat at night but the shady location and open tent made for a very pleasant temperature. Thank you Debbie!!!
50701568,Reindert August 2021 Debbie is a most kind  lovely and helpful host! The campsite is beautiful and everything you could wish for is provided.
50701568,"Guilhem August 2021 Debbie is a lovely host and the ""Glamping"" experience was wonderful! Relaxing setting  great view for the lookout  close (could not be closer) to nature. Communication ran more than smoothly. I would definitely recommend!"
50701568,Nikolina August 2021 The Debbie's place is a little diamond for all of those who look for a peaceful and restful holiday. The camping site is a perfect example of how a sustainable tourism should look like - small scale  renewable energy and environmentally friendly facilities. Apart from that  Debbie and her family are absolutely amazing hosts  super caring and ready to help anytime. The camping site has an adorable and unique coastal view and summer nights are refreshing so you can have a plenty of good sleep outdoors. I particularly liked the story behind the camping site which Debbie likes to share with its guests and all the little details around it which prove the site had been made with a lot of love and commitment. I would strongly recommend this place to everyone looking for such a holiday.  10/10
50701568,Matthieu September 2022 Great stay at Deddie's  who welcomed us with open arms! The place is very beautiful and relaxing. Deddie takes the time to show us the must-see spots of the island  she was very kind. She really has her hand on her heart. Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Ayse-Nur August 2022 Debbie is a wonderful host. The campsite is breathtaking  the view from the platform and the tree house is simply not to be found on Corfu. Of course  this also has its price: you have to walk up and down a lot to get to the beach  for example. Good leg training :) Pelekas is also not far away on foot and a super cute little village. I highly recommend the place! Translated from German  Show original
50701568,Linus August 2022 We enjoyed very much at Debbie's place and will definitely come back sometime. The camp has always been nicely tidy and is well equipped with everything you need and more. Debbie and her family were there for us at any time of the day if we needed anything and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Translated from German  Show original
50701568,Maarten August 2022 We enjoyed the place and the loving welcome of Debbie. All facilities are provided. With also nice extras such as games  food  drinks and so on. Translated from Dutch  Show original
50701568,Lisa August 2022 An exceptional setting and a very attentive host wishing us to have an unforgettable stay! Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Ananda September 2021 Excellent!! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Michel November 2022 One week stay. End of october. Very quiet. Empty beach. Beautyfull view from the balcony . Welcoming hosts. At this time of the year you need a car to fill up the refrigerator . No shop or restaurant around. We found the kitchen corner small and poorly equipped (no oven or salad bowl). That’s a pity because everything beside was perfect .
49460672,Taelor October 2022 If you’re wanting to go to Greece and looking for a place that is affordable  clean  waterside  with an amazing host  and a view that is so perfect it looks fake  look no further. This Airbnb was perfect for my boyfriend and I. Maria was there for any and every question we had. If we ever come back to Corfu  I know exactly where I will be staying.
49460672,Sara September 2022 Comfortable apartment which caters for all needs. Amazing views from balcony. Lovely hosts who were very helpful
49460672,Anastasia September 2022 We'd a very nice stay at the apartement.
49460672,Imogen August 2022 We had an amazing stay. The apartment was very clean and tidy and had everything we needed. Maria was great with communication and went above and beyond to help us out when we couldn’t get a taxi! Thank you!
49460672,Jenna July 2022 María was such a welcoming host. Very helpful with suggestions for the island. The flat was perfect- we swam each morning on a deserted beach. It was busy during the days of course  but centrally located to explore the west coast and a quick drive to Corfu. And that hammock seat was a perfect place to watch the sunset!
49460672,Hannah June 2022 Maria was incredible helpful offering us advice and being incredibly accommodating. The flat has amazing views. A car is a must to explore the island.
49460672,Stuart June 2022 We had a lovely  relaxing time in this apartment. The view from the swing chair on the balcony was perfect. Maria was the perfect host - really helpful. Beautiful beach and easy bus access to Corfu Old Town. Thoroughly recommended.
49460672,Lauren June 2022 Excellent location with a beautiful view. The apartment was just the right size and utility for my dad and I. We'd love to come back
49460672,Pako May 2022 Friendly host  cosy appartement  great view and great location. i definitely recommend!
49460672,Micky May 2022 The apartment fullt exceeded our expectations! It was very clean and the balcony had an amazing view. Μαρία is a great hostess and she prepared a list of recommendations for restaurants  beaches and places to visit.
49460672,Hayley April 2022 Maria’s place is central to the island which makes it perfect for exploring  with a welcoming beach to relax on in the afternoons  or the balcony on an evening. The accommodation is as described with the benefit of private parking in a gated community which gives peace of mind if you have a rental car. We’d come back for sure  but a little later in the year as most places are still closed. Maria will point you to some great places if you need some inspiration for things to do and places to eat. We’ll miss the swinging chair and views !
49460672,Florian April 2022 All you need for Corfu: a wonderful beach and nice house right next with two great hosts.
49460672,Vanessa March 2022 Maria and her partner were lovely hosts. I was a solo traveller and they were always available to contact via airbnb or WhatsApp. They even offered to take me to the next town to do a food shop as I wasn’t hiring a car! The apartment was clean and had everything I needed. Beautiful view and lovely beach to have walks and chill. I would definitely recommend! I will be booking again for sure! Great find.
49460672,Ariles November 2021 Nice appartement with a superb view! However  Bedding should be changed for a better comfort. Good location to move all around the island. Maria was very kind. She gave us all the good tips and is available at all time.
49460672,Daryl October 2021 This place was a perfect base to explore the island from. Maria gave us lots of recommendations on where to visit. Car hire recommended.  Apartment ticks all the boxes and the balcony is so good to have breakfast and also watch the sunset!  Glyfada is nice little town/resort with a super beach  the sand is like brown sugar!
49460672,Valerie October 2021 Small but really nice apartment with a beautiful view!
49460672,Alex October 2021 I can’t say enough good things about this Airbnb - Maria and Stavros went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience and got to see some other parts of this area of Corfu. The view is stunning - book for this alone! - and it’s a 5 min walk down to a gorgeous beach. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again ☺️
49460672,Jonathan October 2021 great apartment and location  ideal for the beach. Maria and Stavros are great hosts
49460672,Isaac September 2021 Maria's place is fantastic and everything we wanted for our weekend in Corfu! The view is stunning looking out over the beach. It's only a short walk down to the beach (which we did every morning). We were looking to explore Corfu and as the apartment is centrally located on the island it's a great spot. The bed is comfortable  the wifi is fast (if you need to work) and the place is stylishly decorated. Can't wait to come back next year :)
49460672,Marina September 2021 Maria’s apartment is small but cute. Enough for two people but wouldn’t recommend more. It has a small balcony with a little hammock. Directly view on the ocean  which is of course beautiful. You have the beach right in front of you.  I must admit though   that we preferred other beaches  which were 30/40 min away (other side of the island)  so you definitely need a car to get there. There are restaurants down there  there are closing early in the eves though  so if u wanna go for dinner   I would recommend to go early or drive somewhere.  The bathroom is very small and the shower has not much power. But Some might not bother.  Maria is great in communication. She always answered directly and helped us directly. (Advised as well as fixing a broken toilet seat)! Thank you for that.
49460672,Ryan September 2021 Stunning views  very helpful host! Stay if you want some peace and quiet with a balcony that never gets boring!
49460672,Dariusz July 2021 Apartment with everything you need  clean and cozy. Great view and close to the beach. I fully recommend it.
49460672,Sebastian June 2021 awesome view and steep but short walk to a perfect beach  had a great time and would have loved to spend more nights there. Also very pleasant hosts
49460672,Michael June 2021 Host: 5* - very helpful  very good recommendations for trips  late check out Apartment: 5* - it is as beautiful as it is shown on the pics  sleeping with the sound of the ocean - awesome! Location: 5* - very quiet location  only sound of the ocean :) rental car is still recommended
49460672,Sascha October 2022 Beautiful little apartment on surely one of the most beautiful beaches in Corfu. From the terrace you have a wonderful view of this. The apartment was very clean. The hosts very friendly. Gladly come back. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Malin September 2022 The stay in Glyfada in Maria and Stravos' apartment was very wonderful. The view from Balcony is indescribable. Maria and Stavros are warm-hearted hosts and always on hand if we needed any questions or help. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Geoffrey September 2022 Great sea view  excellent terrace. 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Antonio August 2022 The apartment has a very panoramic location. The balcony is equipped with comfortable chairs  a table for lunch and also a very comfortable hanging chair to enjoy complete relaxation. Glyfada Beach is a couple of minutes' walk Translated from Italian  Show original
49460672,Sylvie July 2022 A breathtaking view  a very well located and beautifully decorated home. We were very happy with the welcome  the owners are very kind and attentive. I really recommend this place for a quiet holiday. Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Chiara July 2022 Thank you for the great stay! Everything was perfect! Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Lisette July 2022 An idyllic place with a beautiful balcony overlooking the sea! Be careful however for those who would have trouble walking you have to go down five minutes of stairs before arriving at the beach... A perfect welcome and very wise advice from Our Hosts! Thank you 🤩 Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Sophie May 2022 Very nice  uncomplicated and helpful - got great tips for the area and also felt very comfortable in the apartment and on the balcony! :) Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Sylvain May 2022 Great place to visit this beautiful island. This place is really good. Thank you to our host for all their advice and kindness. Hope to have the opportunity to come back Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Richard November 2021 We had the perfect time. The apartment is even more beautiful than in the photos (and it's already fantastic there). The host is very friendly and gave us lots of good tips on what to do. All in all we would recommend it to anyone. If possible  travel by car  which simplifies a lot. You can also explore this beautiful island and see many great places.  We were there now in November  which is something next to the season and means a lot is closed. Nevertheless  it is worth the trip and the experience. Small shops are open and you can cook in the apartment  which means that you can enjoy a delicious dinner with direct sea views. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Victor August 2021 A comfortable studio with a dedicated parking space  a great view of the horizon. Direct access to the family beach of Glyfada  very lively during the day  and very quiet in the evening. The real plus of the studio is its terrace  quiet and not overlooked. Quite ideal location on the island as you will find the charm of the beaches to the west  while being close to the liveliness of Corfu  perfect for a night out in town. Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Annelise August 2021 Maria is very attentive  available  trusted and accommodating ! The apartment has exceptional views  it matches the photos. Thank you Maria for hosting us ! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Salima June 2021 The place to be ! We spent 5 nights at Maria's. The apartment is very good with an amazing view and so relaxing. Very well equipped. If you want to move a little  transportation is essential. We opted for a quad which we managed to see with the help of Maria. She connected us with a guy who brought us the quad there. Maria was very available and responsive and we thank her very much. We would recommend this place if you are looking for tranquility. Also one last note the Glyfada page is just beautiful  for us one of the most beautiful in Corfu ! Thanks again Maria ! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Vivien June 2021 Nice and cozy apartment with a beautiful view of Glyfada Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Alex September 2022 Fantastic stay at Stavros's Studio. Everything about our stay there was great. Stavros is a super friendly person and a great host who went the extra mile for us  picking us up from the airport  helping us find a car to rent and offering us valuable information to help us make the best of our stay. The Studio is located in a good tranquil position close to Mertiotissa beach (10 min walk) and Glyfada beach (35-40 min walk)  also close to Linda's Mini market where you can buy things you need. The studio is clean  equiped with all you need and having a lovely terrace surrounded by nature. Thank you very much Stavros for the hospitality and the great stay and the great holiday we had. kind regards Alex & Maria
3838303,Katharina June 2022 You need to go to this Airbnb! It was absolutely amazing - very clean and spacious and exactly as you see in the pictures. The area is stunning and so beautiful and you have the Mirtiotissa beach just around the corner or you can take the bus to the other beaches as well as to Corfu City. There's also a mini-market very close by and some restaurants and no matter where we went  everyone was super friendly and welcoming towards me and my friend. We stayed for a week and we loved every minute. Stavros is also such a great and caring host. He was able to pick us up from the Airport when we arrived and he was always available when we had some questions. He always made sure we felt comfortable and had everything we need and we also enjoyed our occasional conversations with him. He is really a great person and we are very happy that we have met him and we will definitely come back! Thank you again for everything!
3838303,Elisa June 2022 The studio offers anything you need to feel like in paradise.
3838303,Mona-Marie June 2022 The studio is located at  we think  the most beautiful spot on the island. You can reach two beautiful beaches (Myrtiotissa and Glyfada) by foot. Also there is a bus stop and a mini market only 10 min walk away. Stavros is a very kind and welcoming person and he gave us a couple of good tips where to go on Corfu. He also managed to get us scooters! Overall we can only recommend this appartment and we will definitely go there again when we are on Corfu 🌞
3838303,"Mario May 2022 To be honest I am speechless (in the best possible way)! It was exactly what I was searching for and Stavros is a super sweet host. He even bought some groceries for me because my flight had a delay - amazing! Fun fact  his mom lives in my hometown in Germany  it is truly a small world!  The studio is really clean and it is a perfect place to calm down and relax. Around 800m away you find ""Paralia Mirtiotissa"". It is a beautiful clean beach and reachable within a 10-15 walk. I had it all to myself when I went there around 09:30/10:00 in the morning.  Dont miss to eat at ""Spiros Taverna 97"". They serve traditional greek food and the roof terrace is pure gold! It is run by Maria and her brother and they are just lovely.  Another place around the corner is ""Lindas Mini Market"". Here you find everything from a toothbrush to fresh cold beers. Friendly and funny owners who are easy going.  Needless to say that Stavros studios are THE place to go when you are searching for a little paradise far away from the hectic city. This Airbnb was exactly as described except for one thing: I was welcomed by a brand new kitchen;)  P.S. never saw so many fireflies in my whole life. Show more"
3838303,Marco October 2021 The studio is located in the natur outside the small village. Really calm and great for relaxing. You can reach two beaches by foot in about 10-15 Minuten. Everything you need (Minimarket  Busstop to Corfu town and other places  cute cats and dogs  Natur to walk and hike  some restaurants …) is Good to reach by foot.  We stayed ten days at the end of october and still had some sunny days at the sea.  Stavros  the Host  is great and was easy to contact if we had any questions or needs.  Everything we needed for a nice holiday. :)
3838303,"Nicolas October 2021 Holidays in Stavros' Studio in Mirtiotissa mean: holidays in Paradise. The cosy appartments are located in one of Corfú's most beautiful parts  surrounded by peace  calm and abundant  intact nature. Within 15-20 mins. walking distance you reach the magic beach of Mirtiotissa  enjoying the most spectacular vistas onto the Mediterranean on your way. Stavros  the host  is a warmhearted Corfiot man with a great and unique sense of hospitality: he will do anything in order to make you feel at ease and comfortable as a guest in his studios. The appartments are fully furnished and equipped with everything possibly needed during your stay. And Stavros has a really subtle eye for what you might need  so don't be surprised if you find your fridge already filled with groceries at your arrival! Don't even be surprised  if the host is expecting you at the airport at your arrival! The appartments are kept perfectly clean by their owner (actually much more accurate than many hotels I've seen). Each appartment is separated from the other one in order to guarantee privacy. Both are provided with a little  patio-like covered veranda  which - with some candlelight - will turn your evenings into unforgettable romantic moments in the peace of nature. The next mini market  called ""Linda's Mini Market""  is located wtihin about 15 minutes' walking distance. You will find everything for your everydays' needs: they offer a wide choice of very good local and Greek wines  fruit juices  excellent local products such as Feta  Olives etc. And they will always try their best to help  if you have special questions. For those who prefer to enjoy the Greek cuisine in restaurants  there are three recommendable taverns within walking distance: ""Elía Tavern""  half way on the street to Mirtiotissa Beach  ""Bella Vista""  a little bit behind and above the Beach (perfect for spectacular sunsets!) and - to the other side of Stavros' Studio  in the little village of Kellia  just up the street  behind ""Linda's Mini Market"" - Spiros' Tavern 97  a picturesque and very friendly place. If you don't have a car or motorbike  no problem: the KTEL Green Bus line B 17 will take you to Corfú City within 30 mins. The bus stop is just about a 10 mins. walk away from the appartments. Now  that I write this down  my inner eye recalls the magic time I have spent in Mirtiotissa. I found Stavros' Studio by sheer (AND HAPPY!) coincidence in the net. Stavros' philosophy and phenomenal sense of hospitality are the best answer AGAINST all the blockheaded and silly all-inclusive-packages for mass tourism and THE reason  why individual holidays in Greece and other European countries are SO rewarding! Stavro  evcharistó para polí for all these unexpected magic moments - I will be back to Mirtiotissa. Nico Show more"
3838303,Nils October 2021 Stavros Studio is a very cozy and quiet place beautifully situated between the olive tree hills. If you want to avoid big hotels and party crowds  this is your choice!

Stavros is a very kind and funny guy  he picked us up from the airport and brought us back for departure and was all in all very helpful.
3838303,Andrea August 2021 Amazing! The house is a little refuge in the nature  in a quiet and peaceful part of the island.

3838303,Yelyzaveta July 2021 It was a great week with the best memories. This place will fall in love with itself from the first day  clean  quiet  comfortable. Very secluded and just a 10 minutes walk to the most intimate  picturesque beach. Many thanks to Stavros  for communication and recommendations
3838303,Robert June 2021 This cozy venue exceeded my expectations! It’s within walking distance of Mirtiotissa Beach as well as Glyfada Beach (especially if you find the short-cut behind Elia’s Taverna). It’s also within walking distance of a small grocery store and two good restaurants. If you rent a car  the location is centrally located within an hour of most Corfu tourist sites. Of course  the best part of this Airbnb is it’s owner Stavros. He’s super available  friendly  eager to please and stocks the fridge with a great start of groceries  that is especially helpful if you arrive late. And the Wi-Fi is strong! I’ve never had a better Airbnb experience.

The next grocery Shop is 2 Minutes away by car and you can find there tasty local Feta  and pasta  Rice all you can find in a village shop  even a small bar which offers fresh drinks. We rented a scooter and we moved around so easily with it. Ask Stavros about rentals. He will connect you with the local rental Company  which again are the nicest People you can expect. I cannot give this place enough Stars to Show What it can offer. I am So Glad we found it. Show more
3838303,Christina October 2020 Stavros is a great host and the location is great if you prefer nature and quiet.
3838303,Eva October 2020 Lovely place surrounded by nature with beautiful views. The garden is large and very secluded. The place has exactly what you need for a relaxing holiday! Stavros is very friendly and helpful. Many thanks!
3838303,June September 2020 A lovely secluded studio  off the beaten track  surrounded by olive groves  within reach of quiet beaches. Something very special.
3838303,Tim September 2020 The best airbnb I have ever stayed at all made perfect by the wonderful host Stavros. From picking me up at the airport for a very fair petrol cost through to the attention to detail in the apartment. For the price it is outstanding value. Big bed  hot shower  small terrace and lots of little touches. The best is the provision of some food and drink to get you started. If you are active you can get to four or five beautiful beaches on foot with two being very close. Secure parking if you have a car. Also close buy is a local shop and a coupe of great tavernas. All I can say is if you are coming to Corfu you must let Stavros look after you.
3838303,Veronika August 2020 Everything was perfect  starting with the location and private parking place and ending with the thoughtfulness of the house. We had everything we needed for life. Stavros is the most hospitable host  he even bought us some food: eggs  cheese  ham  bread  beer  butter.. Stavros has also left us a map with marks of some interesting places to visit + he gave us some tips about parking near the beaches. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely will come again!
3838303,Tom July 2020 Great little apartment at a perfect (quiet) location between a small village and Mirtiotissa beach. Stavros is a fantastic host. Perfect communication and great hospitality. Fridge was already filled up with basic foodstuff when we arrived. Really made us feel at home. Highly recommended! Thanks again Stavros.  Maxime and Tom
3838303,Tibor July 2020 It is an awesome place to stay  and it is really in the nature. :) Glyfada Beach is 10-15 minutes walk in a small trail. The other nearest beach is Mirtiotissas Beach and easily the most beautiful beach we've ever seen. Stavros gave us all the details we needed  helped with all our questions and also recommended the best restaurants. :)
3838303,Julian July 2020 A perfect place in the nature near Mirtiotissa and glyfada beach. The studio was clean and furnished with all the things you may need. Stravos is an exception host!
3838303,Verena October 2019 This was my first booking with airbnb and I am more than happy that I've chosen Stavros as a host and the lovely studio in nature. It is a really quite place near Mirtiotissa Beach. To explore the island itself I highly recommend to rent a car for the time.
3838303,June October 2019 A quiet and relaxing haven in a lovely part of Corfu. The accommodation is spacious and comfortable  and the large terrace is a real plus for enjoying sun and shade during the day  and the stars at night. Stavros  the host  could not be more helpful. We highly recommend!
3838303,Jonas September 2019 We had a very enjoyable stay at Stavros' studio. Everything was as described  the nature and the beaches were wonderful. Stavros is a warm and open person and gave us some nice tips regarding restaurants or other trips.
3838303,Tre September 2019 This was our second visit to Corfu  and both times we have stayed at Stavros's studio in nature! The atmosphere is so relaxing and not too far for going north or south f the island within maybe 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes by car if traffic is decent. The studios are close to a minimarket which is a 10-minute walk or 2-3 minture drive and if you are driving you can take the trail or roads paths to get there. There are 3 beaches local to the studio  Pelekas beach  Glyfada Beach & Miritossa Beach which is a partly/mostly nude beach but there are areas near it by the roadside you can go to if that is not your thing. The Bus line is very close if you do not rent a car (by linda's minimarket).  Stavros as always is very friendly and does whatever he can to make the stay enjoyable!
3838303,Sylvain August 2019 Stavros is so friendly  he gave us a so warm welcome in his house ! A super host ! The house is well-equipped and so well located  close to Mirtiotissa beach (15' by foot) and to the airport (30 mn by car)  in a quiet and wonderful landscape. Stavros gave us many recommandations about the beaches  restaurants... We have had wonderful holidays in Corfu ! I strongly recommend Stavros and his house.
3838303,Rachael July 2019 The photos don’t do it justice! This is the perfect accommodation if you’re looking to avoid busy tourist areas. Stavros was a thoughtful and generous host  the local amenities were awesome and the studio itself was very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend!
3838303,Daniel July 2019 Thanks again for everything Stavros. We have spent an amazing time at your place! :)
3838303,Norbert June 2019 Stavros is a friendly good landlord who looks after the well-being of his tenants. The studio is beautifully situated in the nature and has a perfect walking distance to the beach and the mini market. We felt very comfortable there and can only recommend the studio and the landlord.
3838303,Jeannie June 2019 This studio is way out in the country side away from towns and even from villages. It is very near to a village  but is down the lane that leads to Myrtiotossa beach  and there are just the 2 studios that belong to Stavros. You are near the top of a mountain surrounded by olive trees and greenery. The stars at night are very beautiful  and the bird song is amazing. We also saw fireflies there. The studio is perfectly adequate for a comfortable stay. A double bed  a single bed  and 2 sofas; a bathroom with a shower  and a small kitchen area with fridge  cooker and sink. Stavros has supplied all kitchen equipment  towels for everyone  and he even had bought some food for us that was in the fridge - cheese  ham  tomatoes  milk etc. This is a lovely place to stay if you want to get away from people! It is in a great location and it is easy to get down to the beach  and also near to small towns and other lovely beaches. I highly recommend staying at Stavros's studio. He is a great host  easy to contact  good communication and very responsive. Show more
3838303,Salomé May 2019 A very cute house located in the nature  close to the very beautiful beaches of Mirtiotissa and Glyfadas. Stavros was very welcoming and picked us in Paleokastritas and recommended us very beautiful walks around (there are several easy trails next to his house  to a monastery on the top of the little mountain). Plus  the house was very well equipped  and Stavros even bought welcoming dishes for our arrival... Definititely recommended  thanks again Stavros!
3838303,Jonny May 2019 Stavros gave us a warm personal welcome and made sure we had everything we needed  having already provided some wine  bread  cheese and meat for our arrival. His place is spotlessly clean  well equipped and quiet. It’s perfectly located in walking distance to the gorgeous beach of Mirtiotissa and the lovely Elia Taverna. We will remember fondly sleeping in the hammock on the terrace and hope to come back soon. Great value  a friendly and caring host and a lovely place to stay. What more could one ask for?
3838303,Patrick May 2019 we loved our stay at stavros place. he was very helpful and welcoming. very quiet place  no one around  lovely beach nearby. we appreciated to have some food in the fridge for us on arrival as it was Easter Sunday and most restaurants were closed. If we return to Corfu we will definitely go back to stavros.
3838303,Drew April 2019 Stavros is a great host! He was very kind and even made time to give me a ride to the next town after i checked out. I definetly recommend staying with him.
3838303,Liam April 2019 Stavros’s studio was really lovely. It is in a perfect location if you like to avoid the busy tourist hotspots. As we went in the off-season there weren’t many restaurants open within walking distance  however we hired a moped and that was perfect to take us to the nearby beaches and villages. The area is very steep  but very beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
3838303,Wiola October 2018 great host! highy recommended!
3838303,Tre September 2018 Stavros  was a great host. He gave us tips on things to do around the island and was atentive to our every need! There is a supermarket close by as well as a couple of tavernas and a green bus stop  he helped arrange a car rental for us and it was dropped of and picked up from the studio as well as having stavros pick us up and drop us off to the airport! I would stay again when coming back to Corfu. Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Andy September 2018 Met more than our expectations such good value for money!
3838303,Karen August 2018 Perfect idyll away from the hustle and bustle of tourist areas. A short walk to beautiful swimming and snorkelling  the lovely monastery  and a short cut through the olive trees to the mini-market. You can walk to the C13 chapel at the top of the mountain with views right across Corfu - then come back to your own peaceful space to relax. We loved every minute  and Stavros was incredibly helpful and responsive. Highly recommended !
3838303,Kristina August 2018 Stavros ist the most wonderful host you could ever imagine. He is friendly and lovely. Picked us up from the airport  filled the fridge with food  organized a scooter  helped us with everything  brought us clean towels... it was the best holidays I ever had!
3838303,Jude July 2018 Stay here for a very relaxed and to gain a very 'local' experience. The smaller beach is within walkin distance as is a local mini market  taverna  bus top and restaurant. We didn't want to go travelling too far so made the most of the local amenities and enjoyed a very relaxed  calm and typical Greek lifestyle. Come and enjoy Stavros' hospitality...
3838303,Michael July 2018 Stavros is a great host. He is very helpful. The Studio is located very close to Mirtiotissa Beach. Bus stop to Corfu City is close by. Nice and quiet location. I recommand staying in Stavros' studio.
3838303,Lauretta June 2018 Stavros' studio was in a fantastic location; perfect for a rural escape. The village was friendly and useful  the beaches nearby were great  especially Glyfada. Lots of hills  but we didnt bring a car and the location was still managable. The bus service was predictable and easy to navigate  although following the timetable and looking at routes in advance would be advised. Stavros picked us up from the airport and gave us great advice about the area. All in all a wonderful stay. Highly recommend. :)
3838303,Trishy May 2018 It was on a quiet country road just near a few beaches. Lovely tranquil atmosphere and an area outside where you could sit and relax and enjoy your morning coffee. Stavros supplied a lovely selection of fridge essentials   a well equipped self catering kitchen and a few cheeky beers . ;). Just felt like you were surrounded by nature . Also very safe with secure gates to lock when you head out and come in. There are neighbours next door but we never heard a peek out of them . Was very peaceful and a perfect stay  with a perfect host who just made sure you were ok and popped back if necessary . Thanks again Stavros . We know where to come if we return to Greece . Trish and Lee :)
3838303,Renee May 2018 Beautiful location  quit and amazing surroundings. Loved the hammock outside for daytime naps. Stavros was outstanding in his hospitality and had some lunch on arrival. Quick reply on questions as well. Near the beach. Great price for the house you get in return. We would love to come back here.
3838303,Roo May 2018 What a lovely  relaxing location! The perfect base for walking in the hills and to nearby picturesque hillside villages  or relaxing and enjoying the Corfu countryside. The studio is in a beautiful little green valley  10 minutes walk from the sea. The nearest beach  Mirtiotissa  is under a dramatic cliff  with rocks to clamber on (the larger part behind the rocks is nudist  but at the far end  nearer the track  swimsuits are fine!). A lovely little monastery with peacocks in the garden is up the track from the beach  and a rambling walk further takes you to an abandoned village  and on up to a chapel on the hill. Beautiful views of Corfu. A longer  sandier beach  Glifada  is also 10 minutes walk away down a footpath through the trees. The local village shop is 10 minutes up the road  with a lovely little restaurant  Spiros97  bit further into Vatos village. There is also a restaurant  Ellia  on the way down to Mirtiotissa beach. There are buses into Corfu city. The studio itself is well equiped with all essentials  a lovely little home with a spacious terrace. Stavros himself is most welcoming  helpful and friendly! A delightful host!! :-) I highly recommend this place for a relaxing  roaming and rambling  rural retreat!!!
3838303,Alex May 2018 If you're even thinking about staying in Corfu  stop looking for other places  and stay here. First of all  Stavros is an incredible host-- he makes you feel very at home and welcome in Corfu  and stocks the house with food and drinks for you to get started before you do some shopping of your own. He recommends some incredible things to see and do  and without his recommendations  our trip wouldn't have been half as memorable. He was always available whenever we needed him (and we didn't  but he made sure to communicate well with us and tell us that we could contact him if we needed anything  from advice to fresh towels to anything else). Located not far from two great beaches  this place is surrounded by relaxing nature and isolated from the noise and business of the city.  Also  if you stay here  visit Linda's Mini-market as often as you can. Linda is amazing  and so is her husband. They're used to tourists  and they have amazing food and easy groceries if you need to do some shopping. We were there twice a day just to buy fresh pastries  hang out  and drink.
3838303,Emily April 2018 The place is super clean and the host is really quick at responding. I would suggest to rent a car/scooter because everything is hard to get to by foot. Other than that the place was super comfy and beautiful. Would definitely recommend.
3838303,Sergei April 2018 This is an amazing studio flat in a great location with an amazing host!  Flat:  The flat is clean and tidy with everything you need. It has a nice little area outside where you can relax in the sun! Stavros even provided some food and beer so it really felt like home straight away!  Location:  Turned out to be a better location that I expected. You can get to Mirtiotissa beach in 10 minute walk but I preferred Glyfada beach which again is only 10 minutes! You can also jump on the Corfu Trail walking route. A nice 1 hour walk take you to Ermones and the beach there. Nice little mini market down the road and a restaurant near by (closed because I went in April). You can also grab a bus into Crofu Town from the end of the road.  Stavros:  Stavros was great. One of the best air b n b hosts I've had. He had some spare time so picked me up and dropped me off at the airport. Was friendly before and during the stay. Provided some wine  beer and food which was super nice!  Can't recommend this place enough for a chilled getaway.  Thank! Show more
3838303,Lena April 2018 Absolutely amazing host and place to stay. My first ever booking on here and such a great start! From the minute we have booked Stavros was very helpful and welcoming. Apartment is easy to get to and its an amazing place. We rented a car and were able to travel a bit and concluded in the end that we were blessed to have been able to stay in this exact place! The air is so fresh you want to sleep for 12 hours  amenities are so great that you dont need anything else. If anything wrong Stavros is always there to help and guide and suggest. Apartment is just exactly as described and so clean! Also small touches like food for breakfast and bottle of wine was a pleasant surprise! Stavros went an extra mile to make our holiday even more pleasant. 100000% recommend! Such a great place to recharge and enjoy.
3838303,Maciej April 2018 Me and my girlfriend stayed at Stavros studio for a week. Place was very clean and well prepared for our arrival. Also we got some food extras to survive first day. Stavros is very friendly  easygoing and helpful person. He gave us some tips and recommended places to visit. When some of my friends will go to corfu island I will definitely tell them to stay at Stavros place!
3838303,Olly April 2018 Stavros and his place are a great way to see Corfu. The place is in a very quiet area  and is handy to busses to Corfu town  although services on Saturdays and Sundays are reduced. Stavros was a kind and helpful host and provided us with everything we could ever need  including food (and beer) in the fridge  picking us up and dropping us off at the ferry  and even coming around to help when we were struggling to work the stove.
3838303,Liz April 2018 A beautiful place to stay! My friend and I arrived close to 1:00am and Stavros was there waiting for us. He gave us some local places to visit and even stocked the fridge with some essentials. We were close to many of the sights but renting a car is recommended! Hope to go back to Corfu again  thank you Stavros! :)
3838303,Jiří October 2017 Our staying ať Stavros studio was realy great  everything well prepared and equipted. What´s more  Stavros picked up us at the airport and took us back as well. When we arrived to the studio there were fridge full of food and beer and water. That was surprising! Stavros is a kind  easy going and very helpfull guy. He also arranged another accomodation for us. So thank you very much for everything and we recommend this nice and quiet place to everyone. By the way  Mirtiottisa beach is the best!only 15min walking. And minimarket and restaurants are very closed as well. Good luck  Stavros!
3838303,Andy September 2017 It was situated in a quiet rural village! Very relaxing! Stavros had thought of everything including picking us from the airport on his day off! The studio is very clean! Lovely shower room with a good shower! There is a lot of walking including the walk to the beach which is hard work but we got better as the week went on! A pretty shortcut through the olive grove to Linda's mini market! She sold nearly everything! Had a very pleasant evening there too lol!! It is very chilled here and we can't wait to return! Thank you Stavros! Andy and Mandy X
3838303,Nacho August 2017 The generosity and hospitality of Stavros is completely unmatched. I could only say good things about the experience of staying at the studio  and in having Stavros as our host. Not only did he come pick us up from the airport and drop us off there on our last day  but in arriving at the studio we found a wonderfully clean and cool  air-conditioned studio with a fridge full of food and water as well as all appliances you could ever need on a holiday. The house itself is only a 10 minute walk from one of the nicest beaches on Corfu. There is also a mini market where you can buy everything you may need  as well as a bus stop nearby where you can get a 45-minute bus to Corfu-city. Overall  the studio offers a beautiful  simple yet well equipped  quiet place to enjoy a wonderful holiday. Something which is only made better by Stavros' generosity and helpfulness.  Thank you Stavros for helping make our holiday an amazing one!
3838303,Maria August 2017 This place has to be seen to be believed. Right out in nature yet a walk to beaches and bus stops. Charming small local shop with owners so helpful and obliging. Friendly locals  peace and quiet. Excellent and reliable bus service to town  shopping  sightseeing and amazing restuarants. Stavros really is the perfect host  kind  caring and available to help in any situation  goes out of his way to make sure you get what you want !! Terrific stay.
3838303,Marie July 2017 Brilliant week at Stavros's place. Perfect location in the cool trees. Perfect host  helped us with everything we needed. We also hired a car via his friend Lina at Mega Rent a car ...... that couldn't have been easier! All in all a brilliant week on the beautiful island of Corfu with our little girl.
3838303,Mark July 2017 Fantastic accommodation set into a quiet part of Mirtiotissa  10 minutes walk from the beach. There was constant hot water and air conditioning if required. The place was exceptionally clean and Stavros ensured we regularly had clean towels and linen. When we arrived the fridge was stocked with essentials  some food  water and beer. The apartments are also very secure with fence and gates.  What I loved about Stavros throughout our stay and in the months before we came is that he always responds well to messages. He is a courteous and generous man  a bit of a joker too  but I admire him and what he has achieved. He found the balance between making himself available to us if needed and giving us plenty of space so that we could just holiday in peace and privacy.  I highly recommend these apartments if you are planning to stay in Mirtiotissa or even if you are coming to Corfu for the first time. An added bonus of course is that Stavros will pick you up and drop you back to the airport at no extra charge. What a great guy.
3838303,Etienne July 2017 What a fantastic holidays. Stavros's recommandations were very good. The accommodation is near the beach  and near transports in common to move on the island. Undoubtedly  you will not find any better host close to here. Thank you again for all my friend.
3838303,Didier Et Amal June 2017 Stavros is very welcoming. He did his best to make us a perfect stay ! Great experience ;-)
3838303,Maia June 2017 Loved this place! My partner and I were in desperate need of some rest and relaxation and Stavros' place really helped us do that. Stavros even picked us up with our bikes and we had access to a neighbour's stunning swimming pool. Thoroughly recommended. Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Lucile June 2017 Stavros is really the perfect host ! He's s doing the best to make your stay enjoyable. He answered our questions very quickly before the stay. He picked us up from the airport at 4:00am despite the delay of our plane. He did everything before our arrival : renting car and things to eat (the fridge was full of food for our first few days). The appartment is in a terraced house but well separated and quiet. The studio is very clean  well equiped and really good located : in nature with olive trees fields and very close to the beach. Stravros kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed during the week and gave us good advices to discover Corfu. I totally recommand this place ! Thanks for all :)
3838303,Darya May 2017 I must say this has probably been my most pleasant airbnb experience so far. Stavros is a very friendly and polite person  and a real superhost! His place is very cosy and clean  and the village where it's situated is truly lovely. The local beach is a real gem. We were there at the beginning of the season but the combination of the fresh water and hot air was very pleasant. Highly recommended!
3838303,Julian May 2017 A real pleasure to stay here - amazing location - surrounded by nature and Stavros was very friendly and hospitable!
3838303,Gabrielle May 2017 Nice place  quiet  wonderfull beach not far <3
3838303,Choral April 2017 Everything was perfect. Stavros was an extraordinary. He goes above and beyond to make sure that you have everything you need to have a wonderful experience. The studio was very clean and comfortable. Mirtiotissa beach is only a short walk away and so is the market. I can't wait to visit again in the future.
3838303,Michael April 2017 Amazing  peaceful location. Stavros is really helpful and communicative. Accommodation is clean and modern. Would stay again.
3838303,Matt April 2017 Stavros is an incredibly attentive and kind host. He was ready and willing to help in any way he could to make our stay perfect. The room was wonderful and it is in such a beautiful location close to the beach and in nature. You must stay here if you come to Corfu.
3838303,Kath October 2016 Stavros was an excellent host! He always answered all of our questions before the stay  really quickly. He came to pick us up from the airport and returned us there as well  which made our journey so much easier. We arrived to a lovely clean apartment and the fridge was full of food for our first few days. The apartment was as advertised and the setting was really quiet and peaceful. The area was very beautiful and good for walking and swimming...so many lovely flowers and olive groves! Stavros kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed during the week. This was our first visit to Corfu and we found everyone very friendly...we even had a lesson in basic Greek from the bus conductor!
3838303,Dan October 2016 Had an awesome time staying at Stavros' place  he was a fantastic host and the accommodation was extremely well appointed in almost every respect. I don't think I've had better hospitality through air bnb! Thanks again
3838303,Naomi October 2016 This is a great little space in a very quiet part of Corfu. Set just off a one-lane road to Mirtiotissa beach (about 10 min walk)  its a very lovely place. Stavros is a great host that makes sure you are arriving ok  have everything you need  and is lovely to chat to as well. The studio itself was cool and spacious  with everything you need  including for cooking - Stavros even had the fridge stocked with some supplies to tide me over! There is outdoor seating  parking  lovely forests walks nearby  and much greenery. The stars are also amazing! If you are looking for a quiet  relaxing place where you don't to worry about much besides swimming  sunbathing  walking  and sleeping  this is it. Thanks again Stavor
3838303,Francesca September 2016 Stavros is a perfect host. The fridge was full of everything you can have for breakfast. I loved the location: very quiet and surrounded by nature. The beautiful beach of Mirtiotissa is very close. Unfortunately weather was not that good during my stay  I would have liked to stay longer!
3838303,Constanze September 2016 Stavros is a super-nice host and does anything to comfort me. He even welcomed me with bread  water and a filled refrigerator - that was really exceptional. I especially enjoyed the nice terasse right within the nature. Thank you for the pleasant stay!
3838303,Rachel August 2016 Staying at Stavros's was like staying at a friends. He collected us from the port and made us feel instantly safe and welcome. The house is immaculate and has everything you could need. The surrounding area and beach are beautiful  i only wished we could have stayed longer. We traveled around quite a bit and this was my favorite stop of the holiday. Highly highly recommended :)
3838303,Antje July 2016 I had a very nice stay in Mirtiotissa at Stavros´ apartment. Everything was as described and Stavros even picked me up in another place quite far away. He had a nice surprise in the refrigerator : it was filled with nice Greek things to eat and also lovely peaches and tomatoes. Supermarket is not far away- so you don´t really need a car if you just want to relax and enjoy the beach. Great stay!
3838303,Riccardo July 2016 We had a very pleasant stay in our 3 nights at Stavros apartment. He welcomed us with many things to eat and drink and he was kind to explain all the things to see nearby. The location is nice too  in a quiet area and surrounded by the green olive trees. The apartment has all that you need  and however the host is really kind if you may need something else. We felt really good in our stay and we surely would come back again.
3838303,Uros July 2016 Stavros is 100% reliable and a nice person to chat with. His studio is cute and very well equipped. The environment is relaxed  you can walk to the appealing (but nudist :-( Mirtiotissa beach but the path back is long and steep. Without kids you can make it though. As well as to the nearby Kellia village where there are some authentic tavernas like the Spiros' one. If you like some peace you're safe with Stavros' studio.
3838303,Ed June 2016 Stavros is the best host you could ever imagine. He's helpful yet respectful of your space. The studio is lovely and cool inside with a sweet but practical kitchen. Outside is a great patio with a straw roof that takes away the heat of the midday sun. There's also a hammock and a large table and 4 chairs that you can use. You're very close to the beach and Linda's mini market is about a 10 minute walk away. All-in-all I couldn't have hoped for a better holiday. My 2 year old had the time of her life largely due to Stavros' kindness  thoughtfulness and generosity.  Thank you Stavros and see you soon! Ed  Karoline and Poppy
3838303,Mirjam May 2016 Stavros was an amazing host! He was always happy to help and even filled the fridge before our arrival. He did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible. He arranged that a scooter was delivered to the house and picked up after we left. This ways we could explore the entire island! The apartment is very modern and provides everything you need. You can walk to 3 different beaches. If you stay at Stavros'  make sure to eat at the Spiros Taverna in the nearby village! We had a great time in Mirtiotissa!!!
3838303,Denislava May 2016 We had wonderful time at Stavros' studio! It was exactly as described  me and my family (husband and 7-year-old) had everything we needed plus the warm welcoming and extra help from Stavros who was giving us a lift from and to airport  guided us on what to see and where to go  helped us renting a car and was available online for every question we had. The studio is in the perfect spot on the Western part  close to the most beautiful beaches on the island. My first visit to Corfu will be long remembered and I already want to go back. Thank you  Stavros!
3838303,Jelles May 2016 Stavros was a warm and welcome host  a really nice guy. It was a pleasure staying in his appartment. During our stay we could always reach him in case we had some questions.
3838303,Barbara May 2016 Stavros is definitely a super host! First of all he picked me up from the airport at 5:30 AM!. He had stocked my kitchen with lots of delicious foods. There is also a fairly complete supply of spices and oils etc. as well as all the pots and pans and utensils you could need. Stavros was so kind and considerate and helpful with anything I might have needed. He even drew me a little map so I could find my way walking around the area. He took me back to the airport for my return as well.The studio is very very clean  and in a beautiful location. And I loved the fireflies at night! It is not a far walk to the bus stop shop and beach. I felt very safe and comfortable there. I cannot thank Stavros enough for making my stay so very special. I would love to return for another visit!
3838303,Claudia October 2015 It is a wonderful place there and Stavros was very kind and helpful. We enjoyed the stay in this little paradise spot.
3838303,Veronique September 2015 I must say I fell in love with the place right upon arrival. The surroundings are wonderful  immersed in nature in total peace and quietness. Stavros is a wonderful person and a great host  always ready to give help. He greeted us very early in the morning and the house was full of supplies. It's really clean and has everything one needs. Internet reception is very good. We were blessed to have very nice neighbours at the other half of the house and even when the weather was thundery and rainy it was a wonderful experience. The beach nearby is easily reachable by walk (careful with the last 100m as they are very steep) and I must say it's one of the most beautiful beaches I've visited while in Corfu. There's a path between the olive trees to reach a mini market and a bus stop (Glyfada-Corfu Town) not far away but I personally think it's best to hire a car as at night the street is dark as there are no lamp posts. The island is wonderful and I can't wait to get back  I will definitely stay at Stavros' place again  I miss it already! Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Diana September 2015 Stavros is the perfect  charming host. His studio is perfect and soo relaxing and quiet. Stavros was respectful of our privacy but always accessible if we needed any advice however small. The studio is basic but has everything you need and is just a 15 min walk from a beautiful beach. I would highly recommend this studio to anyone wanting a relaxing   peaceful holiday.
3838303,Oliver August 2015 The house is wonderful!! During our 10 day stay we checked out many beaches all around Corfu and Mirtiotissa is the most beautiful!! The house is just a ten minute walk from the house (very steep though and I do not recommend to drive down by car  we saw many accidents down there). The house (double house  there are neighbors next door) is in a completely peaceful surrounding and it is lovely to just sit outside and enjoy the trees and the birds. The house is all you need and actually nicer than on the pictures. Stavros makes sure that you have all you need. He is very nice and drops in every now and then and makes sure that you have a nice little chat and that you have all you need. So: Very  very big recommendation!!  PS: Make sure to ask Stavros about the hidden trail to the mini market  which goes through the olive grove. It is wonderful.  PPS: Some personal favorites: Pelekas  Giannades  Korfu Town  Lefkimmi  Avlaki. Overrated: Glifada  Paleokastritsa (too many people). Show more
3838303,Melanie July 2015 Stavros is a complete star- friendly  hospitable  kind and interesting to chat to. We arrived later than expected at night after a flight delay  yet Stavros waited for us so he could show us the amenities  tell us a bit about the area etc. His communication with us before  during and after our visit was brilliant. He left various supplies for us in the fridge which we hadn't expected too  so it was great to not have to have to worry about buying things at this time of night. The studio was really lovely- nicely renovated  all mod cons- in fact we really do not think the photos do it justice. The area it is in is beautiful too- really peaceful and quiet  and ten minutes walk to the stunning beach at Mirtiotissa- really one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen (and I've done a lot of travelling!) We cannot recommend Stavros and these lovely studios enough  and are really looking forward to staying there again in the future.
3838303,Natascha October 2014 We spent our summer holidays in Stavros' apartment and it was just perfect. Stavros is the best host you can wish for: open  funny  reliable and always available. He treated us like friends not like guests. He even waited for us until 11 pm on the day of our arrival.  The studio is located near the most beautiful beaches on Corfu: Glyfada and Mirtiotissa. You can reach the small and very quiet  cute Mirtiotissa beach by walking down the road. It is a wonderful walk through the olive trees. As everywhere on Corfu it is a little hike down a hill but good to keep in shape :) It is also near Pelekas which is a wonderful small village on a hill with nice tavernas and a breathtaking view on the sea. The house is located in a very quiet area - no direct neighbours  just nature. Which is perfect for spending some private time  escape the usual stress and just relax.  The studio is very clean and has everything you need. Stavros even gave us a bottle of house wine and provided us with food for breakfast (bread  water  juice  milk  grapes etc.) for the next morning.  If you come to Corfu to enjoy quietness  non-touristy beaches  nature and the Corfu culture you should stay with Stavros!  Show more
3838303,Karine October 2022 A pearl if you like a relaxing stay with a fantastic host  in a beautiful place in the middle of nature with lots of privacy. In the cottage  everything you need has been thought of. Stavros had put groceries in the fridge for us  bread  fruits  water  what extremely thoughtful! Stavros is as relaxed as the place you are staying  what a lovely person! The place is also totally ok if you like walking. We have done pieces of the Corfu trail and the mountain trail that can be picked up close to the cottage. Also  if you go behind Elia tavern  you can come down a short descent to Glyfada Beach  where even if you walk all the way through is a nudist beach  much quieter than Mirtiotissa beach. Another gem is Hawaii restaurant just in front of Pelekas  which you can walk to in 45 minutes. A paradise with a swimming pool and sun beds  with very sweet people who will pamper you completely and with a fantastic kitchen  where we had the best meal and where you can see beautiful sunsets. Pelekas is a nice village anyway with a bakery and typical Greek restaurants and beautiful views over the sea. The supermarket a 10-minute walk from the cottage is also very nice with nice people and everything you need. It is also a kind of village cafe where Greeks drink coffee and beer  typical Greek. In short  plenty to do near the cottage and also a day of relaxing and reading at the cottage is completely okay. Thank you Stavros! Show more Translated from Dutch  Show original
3838303,Gilles August 2022 Studio well suited for two people. Centrally located for visiting the island and for a morning swim on the nearby beach. Absolute calm and discretion.

3838303,Apostolos July 2021 Stavros's lodging is set amidst nature and provides the ideal conditions for relaxation and relaxation. The place is beautiful and spotless  it has everything one needs for a comfortable stay for a few or more days  while it is close to the wonderful beach of Myrtiotissa. As a host  Stavros was impeccable  took care of every detail  and was generally available to meet every need or provide local information. At the reception the refrigerator was filled with various items for breakfast or snacks. Hope to have the opportunity to stay again soon at Stavros' lodging and of course I highly recommend it.

3838303,Eugene July 2021 If you a going to visit a quite and peaceful place  this one is suitable for you. Near you just a nature and amazing views. The nearest beach the best we have found in Corfu in terms of desolation  but car is necessary because of steep way. But if you wish it is possible to overcome it ;)  Apartment is clean a really good.  If you decide to stay here  this is a great place to stay! Silence and tranquility  no noise at all  a couple of hippies live nearby  the beach is a 20-minute walk away  but difficult. By car  no problem at all  if it is difficult to park downstairs near the cliff  you can go up the climb. The beach is nudist  so be prepared :) We were a family and everyone liked it. Have a nice stay! Translated from Russian  Show original

3838303,Doris May 2019 What else could you say that it was perfect. Stavros is a thoughtful and responsive being without being invasive. He had planned everything so that we didn't lack enough to stock up on when we arrived. He helped us get to know the island by letting us know what to expect. The place is perfectly located  calm and serenity are part of it. Anyway  you'll understand  it was great! Thanks Stavros Translated from French  Show original

3838303,Jessica April 2019 The little house near Stavros is fantastic. It is nestled between trees  picturesque overlooking the mountain and beach and sea in a quarter of an hour walking distance. Stavros is super nice and is available for any question. In between  he asked if we needed anything and let the neighboring supermarket know that new guests were coming so that they could replenish their supplies (we were there before the season) Overall a great stay and I'm sure we'll be back!

3838303,Nicolas July 2018 Stavros' studio is located in the middle of nature away from all the hustle and bustle. Stavros is a smiling  attentive person who is always ready to help us. The studio is well equipped and contains everything you need to settle in with a few extra touches in the fridge. The sandy beach is a 10-minute walk away (very sloping road  difficult to access by car). Mini market  bus stop and restaurant nearby but still below.  Great for a holiday away from it all. Stavros remains our most beautiful Airbnb meeting. Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Christina June 2018 A wonderful stay in a beautiful setting. With a very friendly owner. If you like peace  nature and freedom this place is fantastic. You sit on the terrace and hear the birds around you  delicious. Stavros picked us up from the bus station and took us to the cottage. The cottage was clean and nice and in a fantastic place. In the cottage was everything you could need. Stavros groceries done  a fridge full of all kinds of food. I've never experienced anything like this before. Normally there is 1 bottle of water  but this...... He was attentive and asked several times during our stay how we had it and if we needed anything. After a week  it was hard to say goodbye. I hope that this lovely stay will be lived in by everyone with respect so that it stays the same. Translated from Dutch  Show original
3838303,Georgy November 2017 Everything was great! The host is very hospitable. The house is in a wonderful location  with a good view. Wonderful beach very close to the house. Translated from Russian  Show original
3838303,Thomas August 2017 We stayed 3 nights in Stavros apartment. Stavros was the best host some could ask for! He picked us up from the airport late at night and always went out of his way during our stay and always in contact with us. The property is located on a small hill in a talk boiler  nicely nestled in nature. Away from mass tourism and traffic noise. The house is divided into two apartments  but they are well separated from each other. So it's very private. The furnishings of the apartment are simple and not new  but very clean and well maintained. Mirtiotissa Beach is a 15-minute walk (the road is very steep)  and a mini-market is just a 5-minute walk away. The beach is great and spared from commercial tourism. Stavros provided us with a scooter  which we rented for a day to take a look at the surroundings. All in all  we enjoyed the stay very much and can only recommend Stavros! Translated from German  Show original
3838303,Véro June 2017 Stavros is a lovely and very kind boy. He picked us up from the airport and left us food in the fridge.

We enjoyed our stay at Stavros very much and if we return to Corfu one day  it will be with great pleasure in this beautiful place. Highly recommend!Thanks again Stavros!

3838303,Helene June 2017 We spent 5 days at Stavros and regret not having taken more . Stavros is a host who knows how to host from the moment you arrive. Her place is a little slice of heaven. It is exactly as described on the site  better as we are there!!! We will share his address with our friends without any worries. Bring a vehicle to get around   if you are a good walker   at the limit you can get by without passing by . Thanks Stavros   we'll be back . Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Ruth April 2017 Nice studio  cozy and clean. The equipment is primarily tailored to two people. Cooking your own is also no problem  but there are also restaurants nearby that are open even in the pre-season. A good starting point for hikes. Own mobility is beneficial. A car can be parked within the fenced garden. Best care by the host. Translated from German  Show original

3838303,Rudolf September 2016 Stavros is a lovely  attentive  and welcoming host. The place was better than we expected. Very quiet location  shop and restaurant is 10 minutes walk  bus stop. Translated from Czech  Show original
3838303,Louis September 2016 Statvros deserves its super host title because he is very considerate ( offers to pick you up from the airport  leaves plenty of living available to cook  is naturally friendly and helpful ) ... The accommodation is an ideal cabin for nature lovers  simple and efficient ( all equipment needed in the kitchen( except washing machine) and air conditioning if necessary with a beautiful terrace (and no visual pollution to appreciate the starry sky) and quiet and which is located in one of the most naturey corners of Corfu ( 7th stay on this beautiful island that we know so well ) and this area is really excellent with the proximity of the myrtiotissa serenity which is a dream beach and daydream. A tip in every way for backpackers in search of authenticity. Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Catherine August 2016 He greeted us at the airport with a smile despite the late hour...He was attentive to our needs   was very specific to make our stay pleasant. A nice meeting. Translated from French  Show original

3838303,Elisa July 2016 we booked Stavros' house 6 months in advance but 1 month before arriving he told us that there was a problem with the reservation and that other people had booked before us. He quickly found us a solution by offering several alternatives . Finally  we opted for a studio at Casa Elia  which was great  close to the beach and with a great restaurant. Stavros has been very kind to us  always making sure everything was fine. Translated from Spanish  Show original
3838303,Kay-Uwe June 2016 In the summer of 2014 we were in Corfu for the first time and discovered this great region around Mirtiotissa Beach. This time in 2016 we wanted to spend our vacation right there. From the very first contact  Stavros was a very accommodating host who responded to emails within the shortest possible time. Stavros picked us up from the airport and brought us back  a great service He had also filled the fridge as a welcome gift  there was everything to get over the first days. Stavros is a very open and warm person who could be reached at any time and was also available in case of problems. The apartment was very clean and furnished with everything you need. On the next Corfu holiday we will return to this accommodation.  Since we were there without a rental car  we explored the surroundings on foot. In the village  about a 10-minute walk through the olive grove  there is a small shop where everything can be bought. The beach (actually nudist  but some people were also dressed there) is about 10 to 15 minutes away (back it takes a little longer because of the slope)  the descent to the beach is a motorized challenge  but it is definitely worth it  as this is a wonderful place where  in addition to the great cooling in the Mediterranean  you can also get chilled drinks  yogurt with fruits and baguette for cheap money.  There are also two restaurants within 15 minutes  which offer very good food. About 8 minutes is a bus stop from Greenbuses  where the buses go to Corfu Town (€1.80 pp).  It was a great week in Stavros apartment  we look forward to coming back.  Stavros  you are great and we have enjoy the time at your apartment.

3838303,Carole October 2015 Super studio with everything you need! Stravos even left us an almost stocked fridge as a gift. Thank you very much!

3838303,Roland June 2015 Our host Stavros received us very warmly at the agreed time in his listing which was completely as described by him. The studio is located in the middle of nature and in total calm. The countryside is very beautiful and the sea is a 5-minute drive. Stavros was kind enough to provide us with provisions to start the stay. If we can come back it will be with pleasure in this beautiful place. Thanks again Stavros!

35279483,Ryanne June 2019 We could not have imagined a better host for our amazing holiday in Greece. Pelekas was a great choice  and so was the apartment we spent it in. Close to several stunning beaches  it was best to rent a scooter. The home was gorgeous and extremely clean  having the comfort of airconditioning in every room and a large refrigerator. Two balconies that alternated each other during the day by providing shade either in the morning or the afternoon. The home is situated in the main road of Pelekas  so things like small supermarkets and restaurants are walking distance. Loannis and Fani were amazing hosts that truly did their best to make our stay here as enjoyable as possible  giving great recommendations and even organizing a barbecue with the other tenants. If we ever visit Corfu again we will not hesitate to book this apartment again! (Even if it were only for the amazing gyros grillroom nextdoor.)

22726458,Valerie November 2022 Beautiful view from the balcony and easy access to the beach with private parking. Eleni’s communication was great. The location may be better during the summer season  it felt a bit dreary and soulless in November despite the sunshine. The pool looked like it hadn’t been operational for a while and the whole complex could do with a refresh and a clean (which might happen in season)
22726458,Toby September 2022 We had a lovely 1-week stay at Eleni’s apartment. The best thing about it is it looks onto a wonderful sandy beach  and it has a beautiful sea view in both of the main rooms. You can hear the waves as you go to sleep  and each morning we opened the curtains to the wonderful view. The sea was clear and warm to swim in as we soaked in the picturesque surroundings. Eleni was a very helpful and communicative host - we especially appreciated that when we asked if she could recommend a taxi company  she arranged the taxi for us! This was really helpful and made the process very smooth for us. She was quick to respond to any questions and very friendly to talk to. Check-in was easy and instructions were clear.  There isn’t much in Glyfada besides the beach and a couple of very small shops/restaurants. This helped to make it a quiet and relaxing experience  and we spent most of our days on the beach - we loved sitting on the sand and watching the sunset every evening. Since we didn’t rent a car  we decided to do a big food shop at Lidl in Corfu’s main town  which is why we wanted a taxi for our shopping. Otherwise  Glyfada is served by a good bus service into the main town  which was frequent enough (once every couple of hours) - this made it easy for us to enjoy some days out  both in the main town and at Aqualand.  The apartment was clean but the shower curtain was a little mouldy. The kitchen was very well-equipped with a freezer box inside the fridge  mini oven and hob  coffee machine  kettle  and all the utensils we could have needed for a week-long stay  making it easy to cook our meals. Unfortunately  the mattresses were very hard and my partner actually struggled to sleep as a result - the trundle bed in the other room was more comfortable  so she used that. The sofa could also have been more comfortable. The only lighting in each room was the main overhead light - this certainly isn’t a dealbreaker but it could be improved with some fairy lights. The wifi worked most of the time but it was intermittent in the evenings.  Overall  we enjoyed our stay and loved being able to walk down to such a beautiful beach. Eleni was a helpful and communicative host and the apartment served our needs. Show more
22726458,Jana August 2022 Cosy place with a beautiful balcony and an amazing view of the beach and the sea. The apartments is reachable by steep steps  which was for us a little uncomfortable because we had a buggy. Otherwise this wouldn't be a problem.
22726458,Emma August 2022 The host was really nice and helped with everything. Apartment was amazing and there were everything you could need. I can really recomend Eleni and her apartment!
22726458,Ioann July 2022 Great place to be  great location and accommodation  and communication as well. Best beach at Corfu on my opinion  the sandy one and with crystal clear water! Eleni was incredible host  everything was perfect :)
22726458,Em July 2022 We’ve just got back from a fabulous weeks stay at Eleni’s place. She was an excellent host and we couldn’t ask for anything more. She was always on hand to answer questions and help with local information. The location is superb and ideal if you’re coming with little ones. 25 mins from airport  15 mins from Aqualand water park which we visited twice. The apartment has wonderful views over the beach and has easy access to beautiful sandy beach and clear  shallow waters. Lots of restaurants and bars available in the resort with free access to a fresh water swimming pool between 10.30am-6.30pm. There’s also a very well stocked shop and your own car parking space. We are already planning our return trip.
22726458,Matej July 2022 Awesome
22726458,Matias June 2022 Eleni's apartment was amazing  it was this magic view  and the sounds of the waves to sleep at night were magical. It really has everything that you need for staying a couple of days. The quick answers and attention to detail from Eleni were definitely a +1 .  If you want to go to probably the best beach in Corfu to have a chill-out experience  look no more.
22726458,Gulzhan June 2022 The place  we stayed in Corfu island  is very beautiful and calm. The beach is very close to the apartment. The sand is silky. Those  who have a child  this place is very comfortable to arrive to the beach. The amasing thing of this apartment  you listen wave sounds while you sleep and it is sort of meditation not only for you and also for your child. The host  Eleni  supported and helped us during our stay. Thank you again!
22726458,Alexandru June 2022 We had a great stay here. The place was clean  comfortable  fully equipped and very close to the beach. the view from the balcony was great  perfect place for hanging out before and after the beach. Eleni was always fast to respond and provided help for getting there from the airport. all in all it was worth the money and we will come again in the future. thank you
22726458,Alfred April 2022 Splendid location overlooking Glyfada Beach. Comfortable and clean apartnent. Very friendly welcome on check-in. Altogether a superb holiday.
22726458,Lauren April 2022 We stayed in Eleni's beautiful apartment from end of March to the beginning of April! Despite everywhere nearby being shut and not renting a car  we still had such a lovely time and the apartment had everything you could need to cook.  The selling point is definitely the proximity to the beach (literally 2 minutes!) and the huge balcony. Even though the weather wasn't amazing  we had our morning coffees on the beach and still sat under the balcony when it rained. Although a car would have been handy  Pelekas is only an hour walk away and we enjoyed the hike there as the views were amazing.  Niko picked us up from the airport and was extremely understanding when our flight was delayed  even taking us to a 24hr supermarket! On our last day  he took for a little explore in the car around Corfu Town before dropping us at the airport and it was one of the highlights of our trip - meeting lovely hosts and their team is what makes staying in Airbnbs amazing.  We'll definitely be back  thank you so much! Show more
22726458,Piotr August 2021 Great people! Wonderful place! I definitely recommend it!
22726458,Katharina August 2021 We really had a nice stay at Glyfada Beach Resort. Eleni is a wonderful host and was very helpful with every question we had and gave us great recommendations.  The apartment is simple  but nice. The Beach is super close to the apartment and the view is stunning. The beach was never to busy. There are some nice restaurants/Cafes around and you can do some shopping in the mini markets.  We did not have a car around  but you can easily take a taxi or go by bus.  We really want to come back and can definitely recommend to stay at the apartment :) Thanks again to you  Eleni and Nikos :)
22726458,Leonid July 2021 The hostess is excellent. Kind  responsive  always in touch. I helped a lot during my vacation. Questions such as the COVID 19 test before driving. etc.
22726458,Ramune July 2021 This is an amazing place with a breathtaking view! The apartment is equiped with everything you might need. The spacious private parking lot is just downstairs. Eleni  the hostess  is very thoughtful and caring. I would highly recommend this place for your stay.  Ramunė Vilnius  Lithuania
22726458,Nigel@Pathobby.Com September 2020 Property as described and we had an enjoyable stay  thoroughly recommend
22726458,Noujoud September 2020 Eleni is very helpful and understanding. She really made our stay easy and wonderful. Also  the view from the appartement is amazing and sunset on the beach is wonderful. Location was great for us to discover the whole island.
22726458,Hannah August 2020 Such a perfect spot  a perfect little apartment  a really great host and replied almost instantly whenever I needed anything! The view from the balcony is unreal! I will definitely be coming back!
22726458,Sanne August 2020 Eleni's apartment was a very good choice. A warm welcome by Nikos in a clean and fully equipped apartment. The location is very nice because you have a beautiful vieuw of the Glyfada beach. I would defenately recommand this apartment!
22726458,Luisa October 2019 We had a very nice stay at Eleni's place. The beach is wonderful and the view from the balcony is really stunning!  A tip for those  who travel to Corfu for the first time - renting a car is really worth it (around 100m by feet from the airport away)  because you can reach nice places better by car. Plus  grocery shopping is pretty expansive in the resort's store  so it's easier for you to go shopping by car in another city nearby.
22726458,Gilles August 2019 Glyfada is an idyllic beach on the west coast of Corfu. It's a bit isolated  so a car is a must unless you eat at the few tavernes all your meals. The sea there is crystal clear  amazingly crystal clear! It is quite safe for young children and there are activities there for older children too. The apartment is a few minutes walk from the beach. Hiking up the stairs can be tough in the very hot hours of the day  but the refreshing air conditioning cools you off quickly. The mattresses in the bedroom are on the harder side  the kitchenette could have more dishes  but the view from the balcony makes you forget these little details. Eleni was outstanding when she communicated to us: she gave us tips when we needed them  provided a baby bed  allowed to extend our stay a few hours as our flight was an evening flight. Nikos came to greet up and assisted us with the suitcases. The apartment is in the middle for the resort  with no direct car access  so when you come and when you leave you have to carry your bags up or down  whether you use the parking down the hill  or the upper gate. Glyfada is a popular beach  so the public parking right outside the main gate can get really crowded  and you might end us being locked in. Pazuzu is a lounge right next to Menigos Resort. It's a bit loud during the day  but never annoyingly loud. It is closed in the evening  so you can enjoy quiet evening on the balcony  listening to the soothing sound of the waves hitting the beach. There is a choice of local tavernes around Menigos Resort  but stay away from Golden Beach: it's over price for what they serve. We drove a few times to Pelekas village  where there are many local options for dinner. We will come back to Glyfada! Show more
22726458,Steve July 2019 Nice location with a lovely view.
22726458,Alicia July 2019 Just as beautiful as it looks in the pictures! The balcony is a true highlight. Could not have asked for a better host  our flight arrived superearly and Eleni+Niko went out of their way to make everything as comfortable as possible for us. We felt very well taken care of and had a great stay!
22726458,Danijel April 2019 Very nice place to stay. My family enjoyed the Glifada and Corfu island. Nice view from the apartment. No problem with check in and out  Niko is very helpful guy. I recommend! Danijel
22726458,Christa April 2019 Wonderful Hosting by Eleni! We loved the balcony  the view and the close beach at a beautiful spot!
22726458,Nina April 2019 It features an amazing balcony so you can sit in the sun all day. The beach is just 5 min away and very pretty and you can hear the waves at the place all day.
22726458,Karoline October 2018 Eleni arranged a late Check-in for us  hence our arrival was very uncomplicated. We were warmly welcomed by Nico at the entrance gate to the Resort in which the apartment is located. Nico showed us around  helped us carry our bags and along with Eleni they gave us very handy and useful tips. The apartment is very well equipped and we weren't in need of anything. (coffee + coffee machine  a hair dryer  lots of towels  air conditioning  Wlan  cold beverages for oyr arrival etc.). The view from the balcony is breathtaking and you wake up to the sound of the waves  to a wonderful landscape consisting of the sea  the golden beach and mountains every morning. By car Corfu Town can be reached within 35 minutes; same applies to Paleokastritsa and Agios Gordius. Sidari and the Canal d'Amour can be reached within a little bit over an hour. Overall Eleni was very helpful during the time of our stay. She answered any of our questions very quickly and overall our communication with her was very effortless and easy. We had a wonderful time at Glyfada Beach and really recommend anyone to spend their vacation there!
22726458,Eva September 2018 We had a great stay at Glyfada. The beach is beautiful  the water is very clear and the apartment has a great view. The mattresses are a bit hard  but Eleni is a great hostess and she replied always very kind and quickly. I recommend it to everyone!
22726458,Raphael July 2018 The appartment corresponds exactly to the description and we (couple  30y  France) recommand it ! The view is perfect  Eleni received us very well (for ex  let at our arrival apples  botles of water...) Excellent communication before  during and after our stay !! Only the bed could be improved because not very confortable. We are at 1min walk from the sand beach  restaurants and mini-market. There is several direct GreenBuses to come from Corfu easily in 45min. Thanks Eleni
22726458,Sarah July 2018 The apartment is nice  cosy and perfect for three people. The location is near the beach and there is everything you need. Eleni was very helpful and hospitable. We had a great time there!
22726458,Andrea June 2018 Our stay in Eleni’s apartment in beautiful Glyfada was perfect. The apartment was prepared with the utmost care and was very clean and comfortable. You have to climb a few stairs to reach the apartment  but well worth the great seaview! Niko s was also great and friendly! We hope to visit Corfù in the future and we would only want to stay at Glyfada beach at Eleni’s place!
22726458,Marine May 2018 We spent a wonderful weekend at Eleni’s flat. The view is wonderful and the beach is just a 5min walk. It’s very well located and Glyfada is a really peaceful beach. Eleni kindly let us do an early check-in  and we were very well welcomed by Nikos. The communication with Eleni was really good and she also gave us a very good tips for renting a car. We would love to go back and we highly recommend Eleni’s flat!
22726458,Tim April 2018 The view from the apartment is really lovely and it would make a great base in Glyfada. Handy for the Corfu Trail too as it continues from the end of the beach. Very clean  tidy and well equipped. Air con with heating too if required. The host was quick to respond and check-in was easy. Highly recommend.
22726458,Annika April 2018 We had a wonderful stay in Elenis apartment!! Communication was great. The view from the balcony is amazing and the beach is just 2 minutes by walking and super beautiful :) very recommendable!
22726458,Daniel August 2022 Everything is perfect!! Translated from Dutch  Show original
22726458,Thomas August 2022 Very well furnished apartment with a superb balcony and sea views that you can't get enough of. We did not meet our host  all instructions to reach the rental are sent by message and are very well done. Very good communication. Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Karen August 2021 Eleni is a particularly warm  attentive and very available host. She picked us up from the airport to show us the road  took over with the car landlord who wasn't there  and made our arrival very easy. The apartment is in a great location  with beautiful views. Simple  clean  and ideal for resting without moving  or even going on a tour of the island. I highly recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Natasha July 2021 We had a lovely time at Glyfada beach. The apartment is good  clean and the view is just beautiful. The sea and dining with the pool are a 5 minute walk away. Eleni was very responsive and accommodating and these friends who came for our transfer and the very pleasant and charming welcome. I would highly recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Nicolas September 2019 We had a great time at Eleni's place. The communication was perfect and so was the welcome (Niko even helped us get the suitcase up on arrival as well as our departure). The apartment has everything you need  and we especially enjoyed the balcony ! This one is very large  the armchairs are comfortable and the sea views are breathtaking  it was very nice to have breakfast in these conditions. The sandy beach is very close  just go down a few stairs to reach it. We recommend this apartment 100%. Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Maria September 2019 Small but complete with everything and Eleni was super available! It overlooks a beautiful sandy beach with clear and low water (suitable for little ones) very quiet place to relax. Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Aram July 2019 Very relaxing accommodation equipped with everything including products  nice sea view from the terrace and very nice beach both equipped and free. For families but also for young people (The Pazuzu beach bar attracts a lot). Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Sarah May 2019 We had a great time in the apartment. The location and especially the balcony are great. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Claudia May 2019 The accommodation 145 of Elenis Appartments has a magnificent view of the sea. There is a nice restaurant on the beach with good food and a supermarket. The rooms make a neat impression  at first glance. Unfortunately  the toilet and kitchen are not particularly clean. In the worn toilet brush  thick blocks of cracks stick on  the dirty dishcloths and sponges could only be disposed of with sharp fingers  we had to get a tea towel ourselves. The stove tops were covered with dirty food scraps  which  however  would have been easy to remove. Conclusion: It simply does not be cleaned or used and stained items are replaced. Very unappetizing. And at €60 per night in the pre-season also not acceptable in a civilized country. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Kerstin September 2018 One thing that should be highlighted is communication. Eleni is extremely attentive and hospitable. Check-in is also perfectly arranged. Upon our arrival  Nico welcomed us very kindly. He helped us carry our luggage. As a welcome  Nico gave us cold drinks and a large bowl of fruit. In the apartment you will find plenty of towels  toilet paper  hand soap and cleaning products. The view from the balcony is magnificent. You fall asleep to the sound of the sea. The golden sandy beach is a few steps away and beautiful. Three of us had enough space in the apartment. We only had the quality of the mattresses to fault. All three of them are extremely hard. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Vasileios August 2018 Great stay and hospitality in a great location. Helen and Nikos met all our expectations promptly and with exceptional professionalism  in order to make the stay and the holiday even more pleasant. Thank you so much! Translated from Greek  Show original
22726458,Giancarlo July 2018 Very nice accommodation: when we arrived at the main entrance of the Meningos Resort (complex of tourist houses but very discreet) Nico waited for us who showed us the accommodation quickly but very thoroughly  he also helped us with our luggage because in fact there are some steps to do  but we were rewarded by the wonderful 180 view of the sea and Glyfada beach (absolutely the most beautiful of the many we have seen  ideal for children). The accommodation has a bedroom and a living room (double sofa bed) with each an exit to the generous terrace. The kitchen is very small but more than enough for a vacation  idem for the bathroom that has a shower with curtain. A fire extinguisher and first-aid kit are also helpful. Air conditioning throughout and relatively fast WiFi (for example  to watch TV on streaming). If it wasn't for the habit of never going back twice to the same place  I would go back tomorrow. Thanks for everything! Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Sophie April 2018 We had a wonderful week at Eleni's studio. The arrival and key handover was even very straightforward at night  we were warmly welcomed at the gate and introduced to the apartment by Nico. He had even arranged a bouquet of flowers with a welcome message  a small breakfast for the next morning and showed us the details (hair dryer  fully equipped kitchen (even with coffee  oil  spices  etc.)  towels  air conditioning  ...  unfortunately no Wi-Fi) . The view from the terrace is magnificent - you look directly at the sea  the mountains and have the sun on your face from the morning on. Pelekas is just a few minutes away  Corfu town can also be reached in a few minutes by car. Glyfada Beach is a beautiful beach where you can relax wonderfully and also see the sunset. Eleni and Nico were very friendly and help with their own concerns and questions immediately. We had a wonderful time! Translated from German  Show original Response from Eleni April 2018 Thank you so much! I am so glad you had a great time. We hope you come back and visit. Thank you for your wonderful review!
15976587,Danielle July 2022 I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this stay!!! It was such a relaxing oasis especially having the restaurant right under our place that we could go to as well as the beach every day if we didn’t want to go around the island. The rooms were nothing but clean and the house was extremely helpful and available.
15976587,Patrick July 2022 Nicos Studio is a very Beautiful Apartment with a fantastic Ocean view. Everything was clean  comfortable and nicely furnished. The beach is a peaceful and quiet Place. Everyone was nice and helpful. The tavern with its delicious food is also a must.
15976587,Dániel July 2022 Very nice and comfortable place. The house is in the middle of a pine forest  the view is beautiful. The beach is close to the house and it is very nice. People are friendly. You definitely need a car and some driving routine to get here  but it is fine. If you plan to visit the northern and southern parts of the island this is a geat location to be.
15976587,Maggie June 2022 This was an absolutely beautiful place to stay during our trip to Corfu - stunning location with crystal clear waters  beautiful olive groves and great snorkelling! A perfect little studio with great cooking facilities and exactly as described. Would definitely come again!
15976587,Rebecca June 2022 Just a beautiful spot for a quiet relaxing holiday directly on the sea. The taverna on the beach is traditional and perfect and the water and beach is quiet and beautiful. The apartments are lovely and the views from the balcony gorgeous. Everyone was so nice and friendly ❤️
15976587,Asta And Tomi June 2022 Nikos place is just perfect who is looking for a quite and cosy Shelter surrounded by nature and still you can find around everything you need. Yaliskari Restaurant is amazing  as well the view to the Sea ist fantastic. Nikos and Sofia are such a kind Persons. We will definetely come back to lovely yaliskari beach  all the Best for Yaliskari and his nice owners! Thank you
15976587,Georg October 2021 We spent 6 days in Yaliskari and it was an absolute dream! The beach and the surrounding pine forrest  the remote situation and the excellent taverne made us staying in the little bay for the whole 6 days. Especially if you just want to relax we highly recommend the apartments. The communication was easy and the room very clean. The hosts were absolutely charming and welcoming! And again  the food was amazing! Thank you guys so much again! We hope to come back one day!
15976587,Cristina June 2021 This is a place for nature lovers - you have both sea & mountain. The studio is perfectly cleaned & newly renovated. The view is breathtaking. Very beautiful walking of about 15 min to the supermarket. Everybody from Nick' family to Mirela are naturally kind and make you feel like home. An unforgettable experience! Response from Nick June 2021 Dear Christina   It was plesure to have you here. I hope you are happy and healthy .  Best regards  Nikos Show more
15976587,Georgi July 2020 The view from the balcony makes it all worthwhile - overlooking the South you see the see and can watch the sunrise and sunset from the comfort of your bed or balcony. 5 min down the road and you get to a small beach that never gets too crowded because of it's remote location. Hospitality at the beach taverna is also top quality.
15976587,Paulina October 2019 It was a pure pleasure to stay at this place. We were surprised with higher standard than we saw on pictures here. Apartment is renovated and the view from balcony is just outstanding. There was a little problem with electricity and WiFi due to thunderstorm  but Nick offered us a free meal in his tavern as a compensation. Apartment is located on hill surrounded with pine woods  the nearest beach Yaliskari is just few hundred meters and you can have nice meal just by the sea shore in tavern. If you're looking for perfect place  don't hesitate to book this one!
15976587,Arabella August 2019 Paradise! What can we say? Crystal clear waters  peaceful evenings  clean and comfortable rooms  fantastic seafood taverna  and lovely views from the balcony. Nikos and his team were extremely welcoming  and so helpful in providing advice and recommendations throughout our stay. We couldn't have asked for a more relaxing and romantic trip. Thank you!
15976587,Marc June 2018 The host canceled this reservation 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15976587,Jonathon June 2017 We enjoyed a fantastic stay at this family's studios at Yaliskari beach. The family were extremely kind and welcoming  and we enjoyed chats with them in the evening at the delicious Taverna located right on the beach. Great ocean views from the studios  a secluded beach which isn't packed  also there's the potential to go to the busier neighbouring 'Pelekas beach'  or walk for about half an hour up the (very steep) hill to Pelekas village which has outstanding views and a very cute  Greek village vibe with plenty of restaurants and a bus every couple of hours to Corfu Town. We loved our stay here.
15976587,Stephan October 2022 We had a wonderful ten days here in Nick's apartment number four. The view is simply a dream  the location beautifully quiet and private despite the six residential units. Down to the nearby beach it is only a two  three minute walk and the bay is simply idyllic and beautifully located. The water is crystal clear  partly stone but also a Sanstrand beach. The tavern beckons with a magnificent view of the bay and the sunset. The rooms were cleaned at our place in a two-day rhythm and provided with new towels and bed linen. Check-in etc. was absolutely hassle-free and straightforward  we got to know Nick as a nice and helpful host. We can absolutely recommend this place with the best knowledge. Translated from German  Show original
15976587,Detlev September 2022 We hated on a hike in 2021 by chance Yaliskari and the apartments discovered  and I wanted to be a guest there for a while. We did that this year in 2022  and it was the right choice. We had a relaxing  quiet time in the magnificent countryside. We found the apartment as described and were able to use it for 10 days as we had imagined. From the balcony you have a great view of the sea. That's great. In the evening  however  do not forget the mosquito repellent. Translated from German  Show original
15976587,Cornel July 2022 Unfortunately  almost everything is missing in the apartment for self-sufficiency  otherwise it is clean and the beach is nice  although unfortunately not well maintained  although loungers and umbrellas cost a little money during the day.

15976587,Petra June 2021 Pure relaxation in a small paradise! We had great communication with Nikos beforehand. So the anticipation was all the greater... Everything corresponded absolutely to the pictures  is in reality even more beautiful and if you want a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle  Yaliskari Beach is absolutely in the right place. The studio and tavern corresponded exactly to our expectations  in addition to the wonderful hospitality - vacation among friends  we will be back! Many thanks to Nikos and his team  it was fun with you! Uli + Petra Translated from German  Show original

49912380,Christine April 2022 On-site communication with Adonis was very easy. It also gave us some good information. The place was well located with a nice view from the balcony. On the other hand  we were surprised that when we arrived at 7: 00 p.m.  the accommodation was neither defined nor ready. We had to wait until we made the bed in a home to access it. In addition  the cleanliness of this apartment left something to be desired (dirty dishes  bathroom with hair and hair). The wifi was very weak. The mattress was very uncomfortable. It's unfortunate because we really enjoyed the setting. Translated from French  Show original

26361078,Karen October 2022 The view from this apartment is breathtaking and you get a clear sunrise from your bed.The apartment is clean and comfortable with attention to detail...welcome pack   hairdryer  blinds on balcony amongst many nice additions. It is well positioned to walk to the charming local village  but the beach is quite a hike( about 30 mins). However well worth the walk and great cocktails at the taverna on the right .I would come back.Enjoy.
26361078,Athina September 2022 It was more than perfect in this wonderful Airbnb. Lucy is a very courteous kind host.  The subrise from bed is spectacular  the silence  the beautiful view over this wonderful island- it was everything we wanted.  Also the area is just perfect  as pelekas is my favorite village of this island with the most beautiful beach  100% recommended and i am sure we will be back  in this wonderful dreamy house We had the best summer week here.  Thank you for your kindness and clean beautiful apartment. Response from Lucy September 2022 Thank you for your kind words. We are so happy that you had a nice stay with us. You are always welcome at our home!
26361078,Lennie August 2022 We really enjoyed staying in this apartment. It’s very spacious for two people  with a beautiful bedroom and good airconditioning in the lounge and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom can get very warm during the summer but you’ll be able to cool down in the other rooms. Lucy was lovely and very easygoing. She provided a lot of thoughtful extras that made us feel very welcome. The apartment is well-equipped and even has a parasol we could take with us to the beach. The best thing about this apartment is the view  it’s truly spectacular. From the balcony that spans the entire width of the apartment you can look across the entire island all the way to Corfu town and the sea. Closer by are beautiful verdant hills. Location-wise this apartment was perfect for us. It’s away from the touristy beach towns and the apartment is located up a set of outside stairs of a small and quiet building that has a few other apartments with  what seemed like  permanent residents. I would recommend a car or other motorised means of transport  although the bus stop is right up the road. Because of the central location it’s less than an hour to the northern and southern tip of the island by car and only 20 minutes to the center of Corfu town. The village of Pelekas is a 10min walk uphill  where you’ll find some good restaurants and a mini-market. Larger supermarkets are located closer to Corfu town  an easy 15-minute drive away. I’d fully recommend this place to anyone who wants to explore Corfu as well as visit its beautiful beaches  but wants to stay a bit further away from the tourist towns.

26361078,Kevin June 2022 Lucy is a wonderful host who knows how to help you if needed. She is really careful about the way our stay happens. The apartment is well located  not far from the beach and from Pelekas a cute village.
26361078,Victor Kjeldsen October 2021 We had a great stay at Lucy’s apartment with the best view over the beautiful landscape of Corfu. Lucy is a fantastic host.
26361078,Kotryna September 2021 The place was amazing! The view from the balcony is outstanding  you can watch a rising sun from it. A flat itself is super cozy and bright. The host was very sweet  we were greeted with snacks and Greek beer and wine. The house is located close to the Pelekas village where you can have Greek foods and drinks. I highly recommend this place!
26361078,Michał August 2020 It was a wonderful week we have spend in this apartment with our little family. The place itself was just like on the pictures: clean  cozy and cute! The view from both the bedroom and the living room is just stunning. Most importantly  Lucy has made us feel extremely welcome and taken care of. She would always suggest help  check in on us and just being her lovely self. The beach is just few minutes drive by car. The bus to the Corfu town is 1 minute away. And of course  all of the tavernas  are just 10/15 minutes away by feet. We really enjoyed our stay and hopefully will be back the next year!
26361078,Lidiya July 2020 The flat is very nice! Lucy provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay! The view from the balcony is spectacular and the two closest beaches are simply breathtaking! Highly recommended!
26361078,Matthieu September 2018 A very nice apartment  very quiet  ideally located in a village with stunning charm. The view is just splendid.
26361078,Thaddee September 2018 Nice place
26361078,Marko September 2018 Lucy is one of the best airbnb hosts I've met. She's always helpful and kind. The place is on the perfect spot close to Pelekas and the nearby beach. Much recommended!
26361078,Petru September 2018 We enjoyed our stay at Aurora very much. The apartment was very nice  clean and equipped with everything one might need for a week's stay. The view from the balcony is outstanding! Lucy was very kind  giving us some tips for places to visit. She also prepared us a welcoming package consisting of small things such as: some eggs  juice  coffee and a small bottle of wine  which we appreciated. As a small downside  the alley in front of the building is quite narrow and you need to take some care in order not to block someone else's car when parking. Overall  we think this apartment offered amazing value for the money we paid and we warmly recommend it to everyone.
26361078,Pablo October 2018 Lucy is lovely and very attentive: she left us coffee  fruit  etc; she told us a lot of things about Corfu... The house is impeccable: clean and very new and taken care of everything. And it has a spectacular view. It's actually a unit with 3 apartments  1 downstairs and 2 upstairs  but the feeling was to be alone. A perfect place to explore the island and a couple of minutes from one of its best beaches. Translated from Spanish  Show original
26361078,Sandra August 2018 The place was really very nice. Lucy has put a lot of effort into the many small details  so that you could only feel comfortable cantons. The view from the balcony is indescribable. The place is quietly located and you can really relax well. Pelekas is a great location if you want to explore the island by car. It is centrally located and you can get anywhere easily from there. Translated from German  Show original
26361078,Ιωαννης July 2018 The apartment was very clean and recently renovated! It gives you a sense of relaxation  just what you need for your vacation. There are thoughtful details that make a difference in all rooms. The bedroom exudes a sense of luxury and relaxation at the same time  while its balcony makes up for its incredible view ideal for enjoying the sunrise and the moon in the evening. It is located five minutes from the famous beach of Kontogialos and it is next to the beautiful and picturesque village of Peleka that is worth a visit. It is only fifteen minutes from the town of Cyprus. But above all  we would not have enjoyed the stay so much without Miss Lucie's useful advice that she has always been benevolent and willing to help us. Thanks so much for everything!

41161785,Simon October 2022 The location is absolutely fantastic and the cleanliness was aswell! great place to stay!
41161785,Lucy September 2022 Absolutely perfect location  above a beautiful beach and delicious restaurant and 5 minutes drive to lovely restaurants in Pelekas. Slightly tricky situation with the drainage from the shower and a cleaner comes to do the room each day (which would be great for other people but woke us up earlier than we would like!) but apart from that it was perfect.
41161785,Jessica June 2022 Beautiful place with very nice people :)
41161785,Sonia August 2021 Stunning place! we had the best two weeks in Yaliskari. The place is for people who like calm and remote places without too much tourist crowd. The apartment is very comfortable  it has all necessary equipment to make food for yourself  it was cleaned every other day  and from balcony you can see over the small bay and you can hear the sea. Right at the beach there is a Taverna with delicious seafood and other Greek specials- I recommend to try desserts. The beach is mostly sandy and when you enter the sea it gently gets deeper so it's also safe for kids or those who are not the best swimmers. Nikos was a great host  always ready to answer our questions. He helped us with difficulties to get around the island cause of lack of car. The whole crew in Taverna is very likeable and the place has good atmosphere. We recommend to rent a car or scooter at the airport because Pelekas and surroundings has steep roads and it might be hard to sightsee the island without any vehicles. The food shop is 20 min walking so is the Pelekas beach where you have more tavernas and cafes. overall one of the best holidays we have had. we would definitely go back.
41161785,Fulea June 2021 Great location  very remote  next to the beach of Yaliskari  25 min by car from Corfu Town  5 min by car to supermarket  Kontagialos beach and Pelekas village  20 min to Lidl Supermarket. You do need a car for everything else except Yaliskari Taverna and Yaliskari beach but the location is breathtaking  the apartment is very clean and has a clening service every other day. Great room from the terrace  great food at the Taverna  good beds and linings  clean towels provided. We had a great stay  thank you Nicos  we will sure be back next year.
41161785,Yuliya October 2020 I have been to a heaven))) Amazing views  secluded location full of corfian soul.
41161785,Camille January 2020 The host canceled this reservation 154 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41161785,Tanja July 2022 Beautiful studio  more modernly furnished than in the pictures. The view from the balcony is absolutely amazing. Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
41161785,Maria June 2022 Nikos place was a paradise for us. Tucked away in the countryside  away from the tourist crowds  overlooking the sea. The studio met our wishes. Good beds. Simple pantry. Air conditioning. Occasionally little or no water but that was quickly rectified. Nikos taveerne on the beach is a lovely place to sit with good food and friendly staff.  The place is difficult to reach  the road to it is bad. A private car is necessary. The short distance to the beach is steep and the beach itself is quite rocky. If you have difficulty walking  that can be drawbacks. For us  the benefits outweighed the downsides. We had a nice week there. Translated from Dutch  Show original
41161785,Jason July 2021 Excellent small accommodation  perfect for a couple  strategically located for visiting the entire island  and away from places of great tourist traffic. Wonderful sea view from the terrace  a very nice little beach 5 minutes walk with a nice taverna to eat a grilled fish (among other things). Cleaning was even done every day in the studio ! Communication with Nikos was easy  and directions were clear. Access road is a little difficult though  and the strict minimum dishes for the kitchen  but it's not a problem either. We'll be happy to go back! Translated from French  Show original
2949005,Dean July 2022 Waking up to these views was pleasing everyday. The rooms were comfortable  and the restaurant food was great both in taste and value for money. The family run business involved pleasant people especially Sophia who was super accommodating and always felt super approachable. Just a lovely person.  The beach nearby is beautiful and sandy with picturesque rocks on its edges. -More great views if you fancy the short climb.  I'd definitely revisit Pelekas and explore the area further using Bella Vista apartments as my base. Thank you guys xx
2949005,E Nicholas June 2022 A great little location for a few days and the owners Claudia and Sophia are very professional and helpful..Even when they are very busy they always make that personal touch of talking with the customer.  A little dated the rooms and water pressures could be fixed  but otherwise very good and a great place for a young family or a young couple.  I rarely write reviews but they deserve the thumbs up  Thank you also Sophia very much
2949005,Arttu July 2021 Super friendly and helpful staff that made our late night arrival as easy as possible. Our room was clean and had all the necessary things to make our stay comfortable. Nice balcony with great views to enjoy the sunset with a glass of wine. The place overall has great views as it is located up in the hill. They arranged a taxi shuttle for us from the airport and it was a good choice as it was dark when we arrived and the roads are narrow over there. We arranged cat rental by ourselves but it can be done with the help of the staff as well once you're there. We had a great time  the hotel restaurant is really good and the place itself is within a short walk distance from the beach. Good stuff!
2949005,Ivana July 2021 Nice place to stay  really close to the sea. Don't expect any parties in a neighborhood though. The area is perfect for families with small children. I recommend rooms on the first floor (better view  less humidity). Don't forget that tap water is not healthy.
2949005,Viktor June 2021 We had a very nice stay at Bella Vista. Claudia and her husband were very friendly and helpful as well as all of the people there. Sunsets were totally breathtaking and the room was great with a nice seaview. The food was amazing  either if it was dinner or breakfast. Alltogether  it was a wonderful stay!
2949005,Stranigg May 2019 Everything was great during our stay. The view is amazing  the staff is very friendly  kind and helpful and the breakfast is great too.
2949005,Eloise September 2017 We had a really great time in Bella vista  the rooms were very nice with a small kitchen and nice bathroom  the views were incredible and it was in a great location! Bella vista was a very short walk from pelekas beach which was nice and sandy with lovely beach bars and tavernas and sun beds it was also close to pelekas village which was up a very steep hill. It took about 25 minutes to walk up it which was very tiring but the next door hotel has a shuttle bus which we used which made it a lot more convenient! From there you can catch a bus into Corfu town for only €2.30 and from there you can access the whole island! Claudia was a great host giving us recommendations for what to do  helping organise transfers and helping us with how to get around the island! Everyon at Bella vista was so lovely  friendly and helpful and the restaurant served really nice home cooked corfiot food  would definitely recommend it to others and would love to come back and visit one day! Thank you :)
2949005,Aurélie May 2017 The view is absolutely amazing! Claudia and her husband were very kind and very helpful for our arrival because they arranged the transfert from the airport during the night and they Found a car for us. Claudia answers very quickly to the messages. The room was good  and the breakfast Nice.
2949005,Peter September 2016 We had a brilliant stay at Bella Vista!  Beautiful location and brilliant hosts! We will be back!!
2949005,Juliette August 2016 The Bella Vista is a very special place  with an amazing view and very kind hosts. The apartment was very clean  the possibility of parking the car very useful. We also enjoyed the delicious cuisine of the restaurant. The Bella Vista is also very well situated to go to the beach ok Pelekas and from the hotel there is one of the best sunsets we've ever seen! We clearly recommend Claudia as a host!
2949005,Nick May 2016 Claudia is a wonderful hostess! She immediately made us feel welcome and started our stay off with complementary drinks. Our room was fabulous  and overall Bella Vista is a wonderful place to stay; truly a hidden gem! Claudia was also extremely helpful as far as recommending various places on the island to visit; taking time out of her busy schedule to give us great detail on various places of interest
2949005,Desiree J. August 2015 Really nice place  amazing view  great and super delicious food! Claudia and her family are so helpful  that you feel like a family member. Highly recommendable!! We love this place!!!
2949005,Valentin August 2015 Very good place  the staff is very Nice and hepfull  and I recommend to eat the traditional food of Claudia's family ! Thank you for the trip Claudia
2949005,Mareike June 2022 Claudia is an excellent cook and Sophie is such a lovely host. Souflaki and Moussaka are highly recommended :) But not only the food but the whole ambience is great. The view outweighs everything. Those who live there have no worries and can unwind their soul. The view of the ocean is really beautiful and very romantic at sunset. The Mythos beer tastes great and the bay within walking distance has clear water and we didn't even need to rent a car and explore the area as it was a respite to have breakfast in the Bella Vista  bathe in the bay and then have a glass of wine or beer and dinner in the evening. Pure relaxation! I'm sure we'll be back. Translated from German  Show original
2949005,Jannik June 2021 We stayed a total of 7 nights at Bella Vista and had a lovely time. Despite the situation (corona)  everyone has made a lot of effort to ensure a great stay under these conditions. If you are looking for a quiet place with good value for money  Claudia  Sophia & Co. is the place to be. Everyone is super nice and warm  the location is very nice and the sandy beach close and clean. The only small uncomfortable shortcoming was the mattress and the pillows.

6171681,Stefano August 2018 Beautifull sea view and sun set!!
6171681,Jasmine June 2017 The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6171681,Francesco September 2022 Apartment with a really lovely view at the foot of Pelekas  you will not only feel like a guest but part of the family  Spyros' parents are very kind and helpful: they gave us a bottle of wine they produced  offered an aperitif in the garden with sea view of the apartment  provided disinfectant for an injury and booked the taxi for the return. They don't speak Italian  and to be honest  they speak little in English  but they understand each other. This lack of it is filled with Spyros very available in chat and other family members who during the week have met and made sure that we were doing well. The family is also made up of adorable animals that have brought us along  including Mortis  a very adorable kitten  and Nala  a very friendly puppy. They also cleaned (accurately and impeccably) our room twice during the week  even though it was not included in the price we paid. The house is just the right size  bright bathroom and with a small window  living kitchen with everything you need to cook (toaster  kettle  oven  stove  sink  etc.)  bedroom with double bed very comfortable and a very large balcony with a wooden table where we ate with a magnificent view.  The apartment is at the end of the street of Kontogialos  on the right going down from Pelekas and on the street you will find the only Supermarket in the area (also well stocked for us discerning Italians: there is pasta  pesto and sauce ready by Barilla) and a wall with the writing Rolling Stones  here you have to go up. You'll find a bar we recommend for its very nice manager who knows how to entertain you in his own way. The beach  both free and equipped  is 200 meters away  going down a couple of descents. We recommend renting a car to visit nearby beaches  such as Palaiokastritsa and the village of Corfu old town  with its two Venetian fortresses. Alternatively  a 26-minute walk away  there is Pelekas with many bars and restaurants  but also the bus stop line 11 that will take you to Corfu old town in 30 minutes  from here in addition to visiting Corfu you can change lines and reach the other places on the island.  Thank you very much Spyros and his family for making us feel at home in their corner of paradise where we will definitely return  sooner or later. We highly recommend everyone to consider this apartment. Show more Translated from Italian  Show original

49591820,Morena July 2022 We are a family of 4 and we really enjoyed our stay in Ben’s apartment! Super clean and really well decorated with beautiful design furniture  comfortable beds and everything you’d need as kitchen appliances  tv with Netflix  wifi speakers. Great sea view from the balcony and the rooms at the first floor. Pelekas is a nice small village with tavernas and shops at hand and a good location to visit the island  20 min by car from the airport and from sandy beaches on the West coast. Ben has always been very responsive before and during our vacation and ready to fulfill all our requests! We fully recommend!
49591820,Laszlo July 2022 Ben’s apartment in Pelekas is an absolute rare find in Corfu. The apartment is beautiful  the view is mind blowing and Pelekas is such a cool village with easy access to the greatest beaches in Corfu. The styling of the apartment is immaculate with the highest level of attention to details. Ben is a fantastic host  he was super responsive  he welcomed us with amazing local biscuits  he helped us with car hire and gave us some great recommendations for eating out in the neighbourhood. I simply couldn’t recommend him more. This is one of the best airbnbs that you can find on the island.
49591820,Rupert May 2022 Thx for everything Ben. My son and me had a great time at your really nice place. Top appartement  really nice view to the sea  everything new  clean  well equiped  tastfully furnited. Close to nice beaches of the west-cost. Late check-in as well as check-out was also no problem. In short 👌🏽
49591820,Victoria August 2021 We had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful apartment overlooking the Mediterranean and enjoyed many breathtaking sunsets from the beautiful balcony. The interior design of this Airbnb is stunning and unlike any I have stayed in thus far  selected natural materials are beautifully combined reflecting a traditional  yet modern Corfiot style that made us feel relaxed and at home. Ben and Thomas were incredibly helpful sharing tips about the area and going the extra mile  helping us organise a rental car last minute. Thanks for everything  we’ll be back!
49591820,Jale August 2022 Everything was just absolutely wonderful!  First of all  I would like to thank Ben and his wife for the beautiful surprise for our honeymoon. It's very successful✨.

23113588,Miriam June 2022 We had a wonderful time on Corfu. The flat was very clean  functionally furnished (especially the fly screens on all the windows are worth their weight in gold!) and above all has a wonderful view over the bay. During the week  the towels were changed several times  the bed linen was changed and the flat was cleaned. We liked the beach very much and it is only a few steps away. We felt very comfortable and would definitely recommend the accommodation! Thank you for everything!
23113588,Anna October 2021 Very nice place and very friendly and hardworking hosts. The apartment is well-equipped and has a well-thought-out layout. The balcony overlooking the bay and the beach is a great place to relax. To get here  it is worth borrowing a car at the airport in Corfu to move freely around the island. There are many places worth seeing next to the nearest beach.
23113588,Shero July 2021 Super great accommodation! Hosts are very kind a caring. This is definitely a superhost  but without a “superhost” badge for now :) So  hurry up and book!

580598,"Victor September 2022 After reading all the positive reviews we were very excited about staying here. Unfortunately the reviews did not match our experience!  The positives: good communication although all by text/email as the host stays on the mainland  the pool is a good size  the location is good (car needed) to easily explore the island  lovely welcome pack.  The negatives: the garden is barren scrubland with no flowers or plants and no usable outside space except up at the pool - the other identical villas all have beautiful gardens. You will notice that there are no pictures of the garden in the listing - that will be the reason. It looked like the villa flooded in the rainy season as the bed and sofa were perched up on blocks and long grass had grown around the main entrance! The pool is dug into the hillside and sits up from the house. As such there is a 2 metre drop on one side that isn't protected by any barrier. This makes it very unsafe for children (and adults). The path to the pool is terrible and difficult to navigate as it consists of random placement of stepping stones - slippery when wet! The inside space is comfortable enough but is quite ""tired"" and neglected. Thankfully we had a car and could escape to beautiful countryside and beaches which were stunning.  The frustrating thing about this villa is that the a little bit money spent on it would transform it. Evidence of this is clear to see with the beautiful villas next door!  Corfu is beautiful - this villa is not! Show more Response from Dimitra September 2022 Dear Victor As you seemed not satisfied day one we had proposed to cancel and refund. You didnt. Remarks from guests are a chance for us to improve. Usually. This is not the case. "".The pool is not safe for adults? The rocks are slippery when its raining? Difficult to navigate?"" I am afraid this is a case of ""The grass is greener on the other side of the fence"" so for us there is not much to say. Previous reviews is the answer Thank you Show more"
580598,Helen August 2022 We had a wonderful stay in this gorgeous villa   it is perfect for all your self catering needs. The outside seating and pool are fantastic. The house is much larger than the photos suggest and very cool with high ceilings. The welcome package of food and drink was very much appreciated and very generous. It was also great to be able to wash clothes and use the dish washer just like we would at home as well as watch a couple of movies on the big tv through our Netflix account which the kids appreciated. The villa is in a lovely quiet location but with a car we visited some wonderful locations such as Agios gordios  limni beach  yaliskari  corfu town and a must if you have children or even if you don’t - aqualand water park which is 4 mins drive away. We also went to Porto Timoni early one morning - a bit further to drive but well worth it if you get there early. Dimitra was a wonderful host and communication was very quick and helpful every time. A truly understanding and lovely host. Thanks for a wonderful holiday.
580598,James August 2022 Everything was perfect  thank you !
580598,Jo July 2022 We had a lovely week at Dimitra’s place  with everything we could need for a family of four. The villa is very secluded but only a 5-minute drive from a lovely shop and 10 minutes to the restaurants of Pelekas. The private pool was perfect for our use and the villa itself was very comfortable and a little bigger than the pictures suggest. Dimitra provided a lovely welcome package which was much appreciated. If we come back to Corfu we would definitely stay here again.
580598,Mihai September 2021 The villa is in a quiet place  away from the crowded city and very close to Pelekas beach (5 mins by car). The rooms were clean and so was the pool. The kitchen is well equipped if interested in cooking. We had a small problem with the bathroom  but it was rapidly solved. We really enjoyed our week in Corfu! Thanks again  Dimitra!
580598,Daryl September 2021 We had a lovely family holiday in Dimitra's house which is very comfortable and relaxing. The pool is lovely and a great size for swimming  it's really clean and a maintenance guy every few days. There is a lively outside veranda where we spent alot of time  the kitchen is well equipped and Dimitra is a lovely host who responded quickly to any queries we had. We would really recommend this house  it's close to Corfu town and a number of really nice beaches.
580598,Theodor July 2021 We enjoyed our holiday at Dimitras Place. The house has all you need. The beds are good and it’s quiet. We loved the pool! It’s like a pool has to be :-) The house is very well located. You find a lot of good restaurants and beautiful beaches only a few minutes away. And thank you to Dimitra she is a very pleasant and well organized host. We got all the information in the right time and some good tips.
580598,Christina August 2020 If you are looking for a nice villa with a private pool  look no further. Villa and pool are surrounded by Olive trees and sitting by the pool is so relaxing that we sat there having coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings. We spent 9 days at the villa and it felt so good to be there that we barely had the need to visit all the beautiful beaches in Corfu😉. The villa is about 3 km from the small village Pelekas where the locals mingle with the tourists  where you can eat in a nice tavern while looking at the sun setting into the ocean or have a drink at a small bar. We strongly recommend this villa!
580598,Fabian July 2020 We had a perfect stay at Dimitra´s house. Dimitra and Doris responded immediately to any requests. The pool of course was the main attraction for our children  it was in fact bigger than we thought. Everything you need and very close to the most beautiful beaches of Corfu.
580598,Christina August 2018 A lovely villa and pool. We had a fab week here. The villa has everything you need for a holiday  good basics  washing powder  even buckets and spades for the kids. Dimitra was very helpful. We loved hanging out by the pool  it's a lovely setting with olive trees all around. The covered veranda is perfect for eating out of the sun and sitting out in the evenings listening to the birds. The villa's central location makes it very easy to explore the island and we loved the local Pelekas beach which was great for our young kids. Great value for money we would definitely recommend this villa.
580598,Marcel July 2018 We had a really nice stay at villa Pelekas and we recommend this place.

It is the best equipped house we have ever stayed in  including things like coffee  bin bags  laundry detergent etc. which makes a difference. The pool is delightful and very clean  as is the rest of the house. Dimitra and Thanassis are very kind hosts  communication is excellent.
580598,Alessandra July 2017 Ideal accomodation for those looking for peace and tranquillity but at the same time want to reach in no time magnificient places  beaches  tavernas.
580598,Xiaoqin July 2017 We had a really good time at the house of Dimitra. The house and the pool are very clean. When we had a question or a problem we always get a quick response of Dimitra. The location was perfect for us  to Corfu Town you need only 20 to 30 minutes and to the best beach of the island 10 minutes.
580598,Franz July 2016 Meeting to get the keys was on time  perfectly planned  inside the house its nicely furnished  simple  nice floors  good mattresses. Outside plenty opportunities to find shade or sun  nice pool  clean  the walkway inbetween house and pool could be improved.
580598,Jan Erik August 2014 An fantastic house nearby the beaches of Pelekas  Glifada and mirthisiossis beach in an quiet area. The house is clean  nice interiour and and swimmingpool. We will come back..
580598,Coralie July 2022 Very nice  fully equipped house  quiet surrounded by olive trees and with a large pool. The owner is very communicative and attentive. The place is ideal for discovering the island  beautiful beaches just 10 minutes drive away  and about twenty minutes from Corfu old town  very pleasant for walking in the evening. We stayed for 15 days and are delighted  looking forward to returning next summer! Translated from French  Show original
580598,Gianluca June 2022 Beautiful villa in an excellent location to see the island. away from the chaos  it enjoys a beautiful swimming pool for exclusive use. also in seven days of stay  a pool cleaning staff came twice to clean and control it. we found food and drinks on our arrival. nearby there are two great tavernas where you can have lunch and dinner outdoors. a minute's drive away there is a small supermarket. There are 10 minutes by car from the beautiful beaches. Recommended for those like us with children Translated from Italian  Show original
580598,Ellen August 2021 The location is great  you are very central and can take many excursions from there by car. The house would have to be renewed in a few places and also maintained more  some also fits well as  for example  the beds have been well located. The neighbors in the adjacent houses can also be clearly heard with a pool  but for us it was no problem  as our children are already a little bigger. Translated from German  Show original
580598,Marco August 2020 Dimitra's place is exactly as described on the website. Perfectly located to reach all the most beautiful beaches on the island   it is furnished in a simple but elegant way  and is equipped with all the comforts you need  including kitchen accessories. Two spacious bedrooms make the house a great solution for a family of 4. We spent 12 days in August for the post lockdown  with the low tourist traffic. It is  of course  a car  but in 5 minutes you can reach all the services and the nearest beaches (Glyfada  Kontogialos) and in 40 minutes those of the north east coast (Nisaki Kalami) or to the south ( Issos) instead of the north west (Paradise beach in Palaiokastisa  Agios Georgis). Corfu is 20 minutes away. The house has  of course  the pool surrounded by olive trees   where you can relax after a day at sea. Dimitra  although physically absent  has contacted us several times to verify any needs  leaving a reference on the place (however only called on the first day to find the house - we are in the countryside and the coordinates on Google are not very accurate). In short  the house is definitely recommended . Translated from Italian  Show original
580598,Alex August 2019 We really enjoyed our stay at Dimitra's place. The house was as advertised and the location of the house is perfect for both visiting the island and going to the beach. Dimitra is very considerate and responsive. We recommend this property. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Veronique August 2019 Very clean villa as described. Close to several beautiful beaches and tourist places while being quiet . The hosts were at our disposal   great stay. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Bérengère September 2018 A magnificent stay spent in this peaceful haven amid olive trees ! The house is full of charm  very well equipped (comfortable bedding  dishwasher  hairdryer  very clean pool  deckchair  mosquito repellent plugs...) and very clean. Dimitra was available and gave us valuable advice before and during our trip  thank you. Small touches (fresh water bottles  fruit) were waiting for us when we arrived. I highly recommend this rental !!! Translated from French  Show original
580598,Jérôme August 2018 Perfect location. Private full size pool. There is nothing missing in the house. The owners were at our disposal and we were very responsive in their responses to our messages. Accommodation to be recommended. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Marc July 2018 Very well-equipped house with a pool and an unbeatable environment ideal for a family. The fact that the pool is a bit separate from the house is very positive for families with small children  as the security is greater and you have some peace of mind. Although we didn't have an in-person interaction at all times  we felt very welcome and the communication was very quick and excellent. They left us a welcome treat and equipped the house with things for the kids. We highly recommend this place to other families. Translated from Catalan  Show original
580598,Oleh June 2018 What can I say.... beautiful villa surrounded by nature with all the comforts. The private pool in the middle of the olive trees makes it unique! Dimitra was always very available for any need. I would highly recommend and we will definitely be back Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Dimitra June 2018 I am so happy that you have good time in a strange weather conditions and you enjoyed the house! I really hope to see you again!
580598,Luc August 2017 Friendly welcome. Exact and precious contact before arrival. Thanks for everything. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Melanie July 2016 Thank you for the lovely stay in Pelekas! The villa is very cozy  spacious  clean and well equipped. Two separate bedrooms  ideal for a family of 4 or even friendly couples. Dimitra's sister Mary guided us to the house and was available to us during our stay. The location is perfect for exploring the area – Corfu town and many beautiful beaches are nearby. Translated from German  Show original
580598,Sophie July 2015 We spent 3 very pleasant weeks in this accommodation  ideally located  quiet  in a green setting away from all the hustle and bustle. However  the village of Pelekas and its beaches are within a 5-minute drive. The house is very nice  convenient and fresh. The pool is quite large and well maintained sinceapool-boy comes to clean it three times a week. Finally  Dimitra welcomed us warmly and even prepared local specialties for us in the fridge. We highly recommend this property ! Translated from French  Show original
12876298,Neil July 2022 Beautiful villa  as well described. Everything works well and location is superb.
12876298,Henry August 2017 Lovely villa  great pool  very quiet and scenic location with incredible view. Would definitely recommend to others and stay again. Guest should be aware that there is No wifi though and phone signal is very limited.
12876298,Anne August 2016 Villa Phoebe is lovely  very well equipped and spacious and I think exceeded all our expectations. The rooms were beautifully prepared  the pool a great size  and that lovely view... All in all the setting for an excellent family holiday. Would like to have stayed longer!
12876298,Joyce July 2017 beautiful house with 3 shower rooms  stunning views  the only downside: the access path ( and no internet and little phone) Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Oumaima October 2022 Don’t think twice and book here!!!! It was the best experience I ´ve ever had. You will never meet a kinder person than Debbie 🥰 It was so comfy to sleep in the tente  I met amazing people  the beaches and the views near the place are breathtaking♥️
50701095,Cornelia October 2022 Staying at Debbie's oasis was the best  I enjoyed my time there very much. sleeping in the hanging tent was great and adventures  the view from the treehouse is amazing  the fig jam is delicious and Debbie is just a perfect host.She is warm and friendly and helped me a lot.I totally recommend staying at that little piece of paradise.
50701095,Mirren September 2022 10/10 stay! Debbie is amazing  so kind and helpful. It was such a fun experience staying in the suspended tent  waking up under the trees and sun every morning - and very comfy with nice blankets and pillows. I won’t forget the experience ❤️
50701095,Dawid September 2022 I have booked many different places through airbnb but this one is by far my favourite. Imagine a quiet place in the woods with beach and town nearby and truly one of a kind host - Debbie  who is someone who you instantly love - warm  sweet and funny. You feel at home immediately. This place is really a oasis where you can relax and recharge your batteries. It is so well thought out  Debbie takes care of every detail so you really have absolutely everything you may need and more. I can’t imagine a better place for vacation <3
50701095,Anna August 2022 Debbie is a wonderful host  very accommodating and friendly. The site is a perfect break from citylife!
50701095,Lara August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at Debbie's. She a lovely host and really cares for her guests. I hope we can come back soon!!!
50701095,Kristian August 2022 this place would be perfect for you if you somehow tired of urban life no stress here  only joyful and pleasures! Debbie is an amazing lady with many creative ideas  you can ask her anything if you have further questions about Corfu .Definitely will come back one day!
50701095,Klaudia July 2022 We spend there amazing time. Owners are very nice  lovely and so helpfully!
50701095,Julius July 2022 We had a very nice stay! Would recommend it to anyone looking for something relaxed and out-of-the-box. You can really tell it's a very loved place and we met some great people. You need to have a scooter to get around though. There were many mosquitoes though which was annoying and the scooter rental was very difficult for us personally.
50701095,Marie July 2022 Our stay at this little paradise was more than convincing: Waking up under a roof of leaves to the sounds of birds made our days. We stayed in the hanging tent which was a little adventure  definitely worth it. Debbie & Nicholas were such lovely hosts who genuinely cared for our well-being. Debbie even brought self made banana bread & Baklava to the campsite for us. We didn’t rent a scooter or a car so we walked down to the beach which is fine if you don’t mind walking; the way up can be very hot  especially when the sun is high up. We will be back but next time we’ll probably rent a scooter. We totally recommend this place if you like being in the nature & if you want something different from a cooled down hotel room. Thank you again for everything!
50701095,Rahul July 2022 Debbie was great and full of energy and the camping or glamping place was very well created by her and the family with many tine details.  We loved our stay and nearby beaches. Especially the kitchen walls and homemade wine and etc.  Hope to visit again.
50701095,Anja July 2022 Such an amazing place ! Everything is make to feel you well  Debbie is a lovely host with so much attention ! We take time to relax and be out of the dailylife time ! thanks a lot !
50701095,Lucy June 2022 This site is amazing  we stayed in the suspended tent which was surprisingly comfortable. The hosts are very quick and helpful when responding to queries and really go above and beyond to make the stay memorable! would highly recommend.
50701095,Michael June 2022 It was a pleasure to stay at this camping site. Debbie  Nicholas and Tony are very friendly hosts and they tried to help us from the first second we arrived. We were very excited because all the positive reviews and they are non-exaggerated. This is a Beautiful place and everybody have to stay at the camping site.
50701095,Laura May 2022 This place is indescribable! We enjoyed our stay there so much  it’s just the most beautiful place :) Debbie and all her family were so kind and hostile  we really felt more than welcome and could ask anything at anytime (bus schedules  restaurant recommendations  etc.). They even offered us help for transportation. We also loved the location of the place  it was really calm but still easy to reach (we arrived by bus) and had nice beaches and hiking paths close to it!
50701095,Andreas October 2021 Thanks to Debbie  Tony and Nicholas for the great experience that is giving when staying at their AirBnB glamping site.  Very helpful and kind people!!!!!!
50701095,Jan September 2021 I enjoyed my stay with Debbie and tony’s place very much. They are such kind people  helpful in anyway  and it is a lovely place if you love nature and just want some peace. I enjoyed every second I was there and I’ll be back again within a blink of an eye. If you love nature this is his place to go. There’s a lovely town nearby where you can get what you need. However I cannot recommend the guy Who rent scooters in the small village it’s better to rent one at the airport or in the city. Thank you for letting me stay at your wonderful place.
50701095,Leonie September 2021 It was soo amazing to stay at the Campingsite in Pelekas. Debbie and Tony are such very lovely and helpful people! All in all it was an awesome trip. Thank you so much for everything. We will definitely come back!
50701095,Sarah September 2021 Amazing place and Debbie and Toni were so so warm and welcoming. Had a great chat on the treehouse with Debbie and it was lovely. We had an issue with the tent but they made sure to make up for it and help us out. Great communication and would definitely recommend.
50701095,Jonas September 2021 Our stay in the camping was an absolutely wonderful experience. The owner Debbie is a wonderful person who has created a beautiful space in the middle of nature for us to really relax and get away from the stress and worries of life. So much care and attention to detail went into making this place. Is everything perfect? Of course not  it's camping not a 5 star hotel. There can be bugs  noise from animals at night  occasional footsteps of other guests or the water stops working for a while. But the joy of waking up in nature with views on the bay  having an early coffee in the watch tower and the smell of pines  just let's you forget your worries and enjoy the moment. It's really an oasis  relaxing and adventurous at the same time. We will make sure to come back to this wonderful place when we visit Corfu again.
50701095,Lisa August 2021 Get ready for a wonderful and fullfilling experience of a beautiful location with the best view of the coast of the west  beautiful beaches and last but definitely not least the best host I have ever met! This place is full of positive energy and there is love in every detail! Everything was beyond perfect and the camping site is something very special in the best way. Debbie is so caring and she is having the best tips about the Island and is always there if you need her! I had the warmest welcome ever!
50701095,Ebra August 2021 Debbie‘s place was like piece of paradise . Very safe   comfortable  20 minutes walking to the most beautiful beach in Corfu. Debbie answers very quickly and take care of the guest We were sad that we had to leave   we will come again Highly recommended the place  Thank you Debbie
50701095,Maciek August 2021 Debbie is a great person and truly takes care of their guests. The place is one of a kind and there's everything you need on a camping and even more. The location is pretty good also - the beaches and the nearby town Pelekas are lovely. Will recommend the Olive Garden Glamping to all of my friends going to Corfu :)
50701095,Vos August 2021 first of all   i could not eveR imagine that this place exists in corfu of 2021. This was the place i was searching for without knowing it. Living inside -pure nature- for some days is maybe the best medicine for our souls we all have to found our inner self because we are in danger to lost. Debbie & tony offers you the chance to make it possible  alongside to explore the very very beautiful island of corfu. Highly and totally recommended  im sure that i will come back to this magic -fairytale- place.. Response from Deborah Anne August 2021 Thank you Nickolas! You put into words exactly what Tony and I were hoping to offer. I am happy you found peace!
50701095,Maria August 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Debbie’s site. The view was breathtaking and the facilities were perfect. Debbie herself was an exceptional host who went out of her way daily to accommodate us. I would recommend to anyone who wants to take a step back and trek through the mountains to some really beautiful beaches!
50701095,Johannes August 2021 It was a very nice site  communication was perfect and very nice owners!! Best recommendations for places/restaurants/bars from Debbie about all the island :) Best wishes and hope to see you again!!
50701095,Benjamin August 2021 The place is very nice  and Tony and Debbie are very lovely  will go again to see them
50701095,Aylin July 2021 We could not have chosen a better place for our stay on Corfu Island! We're definitely coming back  Debbie and Tony are the loveliest hosts one can hope for and the Camp they built is so comfortable and lovely. It has a proper kitchen  shower and toilet  we really didn't miss anything. If you're staying in Pelekas or on Corfu in general I would definitely recommend renting a car or scooter as the way down to the beach is really steep and quite far. The view up from the camp however is amazing! We would have loved to stay longer and would recommend it to anyone visiting the island!
50701095,Maria October 2022 The place is great for relaxing  it's super quiet  you can almost only hear the sea. Sitting on one of the cozy homemade benches  closing your eyes and enjoying the tranquility is in itself very healing. Because the area is already so relaxing  it can be hard to move to the sea  but that doesn't matter. You can slow down  read  think and really come to rest here (probably depends on the fellow residents  but I was lucky :)). The nearest beach (Kontagialos) is a 20-minute walk downhill and back about 30 minutes uphill. In the village  where there is a supermarket  a few restaurants  cafes  two bakeries and a souvenir shop and a very nice jewelry shop of an artist  you walk about 10-15 minutes uphill. Due to the reviews here  I had thought of renting a scooter or a car  but I did not find it necessary on site.  All the sleeping places have a small table and seating and the hanging tent also includes a large plastic chest in which I could store my luggage and also organize something. This made the camping experience extremely comfortable.  Debbie and Niko have made sure everything is in order at Glamping every day and have repeatedly emphasized their availability. I also liked that the stay allowed me to learn a little about the Corfu and the local culture and situation  including because the family-owned property already has a long history to the Ottoman Empire. Debbie also provided us with rosé daily from friends from Lefkas or brought us a vegetarian dish from her mother-in-law. Mega was also nice that Debbie picked me up at the bus stop in Moucha on my arrival with my heavy backpack. You really try to make a comfortable stay here and offer opportunities for exchange without any hassle. Loved it.  As relaxing and wonderful as this place was during the day  it might still be important for solo travelers or anxious people to mention that at night the wildlife is steadily audible and you can also hear an animal under or next to you or a little rustling. Unfortunately  this was a bit difficult for me personally  so falling asleep was not so easy. This is not a criticism of the accommodation  but rather an indication for those who might be so important.  I thank you for this wonderful stay and can recommend this oasis to everyone!

50701095,Victor September 2022 It was wonderful! I think Debbie is the best host I've ever had! She was very available to answer any questions I had  she picked me up by car when I arrived to make my journey easier  and even drove me on the day of departure  awesome! The accommodation is beautiful  in the middle of the forest  far from everything  with a great view. I hope to return longer one day so I can have time to enjoy the place. Thanks again for everything  and see you again! Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Carole August 2022 Great peaceful place Away from the crowds A great sea view from the cabin Close to village even on foot Relaxxxx order I would highly recommend it. Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Veronika August 2022 Absolute highlight for adventurers! We had spent 3 nights in the hammock (neither mosquitoes 🦟 nor other animals had a chance against the net) Debbie is just a very gracious person and the heart and soul of this haven of rest. ❤️Thank you very much for these wonderful moments and the great excursion tips. Translated from German  Show original
50701095,Elise June 2022 Beautiful location in the middle of the forest with beautiful sea views. Solar power is used to heat up the water and for electricity. If you are lovers of unusual and ecology don't miss out on this place. In addition  Debbie is very welcoming and available  we have everything we need. Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Sonja June 2022 Simply wonderful! The place is in the olive trees not far from the small village of Pelakas. We had a rental car with which we drove the steep paths to the different beaches. We walked about 15 minutes to the village in the evening.  We had the tree tent no. 3 which was stretched between three trees and is right next to the viewing platform. Totally cool. A nice contrast to other hotel complexes. The common areas (kitchen and bathroom) were always clean and lovingly furnished.  Debbie was always available and responded immediately. Everything was so great and loving. Debbie even brought homemade baklava or utensils for the bathroom in the meantime. Their mosquito spray was worth its weight in gold.  Everything was perfect! :) Translated from German  Show original
50701095,Fabian September 2021 Living at the camp for a few days was an unparalleled experience. My girlfriend and I loved it! Debbie is an incredible host and took care of everything  gave us great tips and was always there for us. She is such a great person! We put them right in our heart. The sleeping arrangements themselves are great and there are great beaches  restaurants and views in the area. We loved living here and my expectations were exceeded. Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Thomas October 2022 Awesome place  all the beaches are close by and there are plenty of nice hikes around. The fridge even had some supplies when we arrived! Home away from home  would love to be back
1690099,Aileen September 2022 Stavros is the perfect host! We had a wonderful week. The studio is clean  ideally located near the beach and has everything you need including a stocked fridge. Stavros even kindly collected us at the airport. We will definitely be back!
1690099,Claudia August 2022 Our stay was absolutely amazing! Stavros is beyond accommodating and did everything to make us feel at home. Definitely a super-host! We would love to return. There are two beaches within walking distance  as well as an easy bus system to get to corfu town. Very nice tranquil location!
1690099,Izabela July 2022 Stavros was a great host as always  very nice and helpful. The studio is situated in a quiet place for people who appreciate nature and privacy. We will come back for sure 😁
1690099,Georg June 2022 very quiet location  wonderful beach within walking distance. also a small supermarket and some restaurants are nearby. had a car and that can't hurt if you want to see more of the island. overall I enjoyed staying at Stravos.
1690099,Kate June 2022 Thank you Stavros for a great place to stay on our third trip to this area of Corfu. It was clean  quiet  comfortable  well equipped  and a pretty garden. Lovely beaches  and restaurants. Local shop nearby. Bus stop nearby to Ermones and Glifada and all stops to Corfu Town including Aqualand. Stavros even left provisions in the fridge for us too. Thank you.
1690099,Friederike May 2022 If you wanna spent a really relaxing and conformable time on corfu stay at Stavros beautiful studio in the middle of a beautiful nature close to a nice little beach. Stavros is an amazing hoste and will have a really great time.
1690099,Kurt October 2021 Stavros is a very caring and helpful host  and the house was very clean. We also enjoyed that a little start package of food and some wine was ready for us. The only drawback is that only a little sun reaches the garden in the low season (late October).
1690099,Lea September 2021 Really cute apartment in the nature. Stavros is a super friendly host and did a great job. Unfortunately in the ad there is no information about the direct neighboor. Its two apatments attached to each other so on the terrace you are sitting 2 meters away from your neighboor. I think thats an important Information if you rent a quiet studio in the nature. 4/5
1690099,Tim September 2021 Another wonderful stay. I never stay at the same place. Except here! Wonderful hospitality from Stavros and great location for walking and hiking to different beaches and interesting places. Everything was perfect and even better WiFi this time. Thanks Stavros
1690099,Alexander July 2021 An amazing location. Stavros is a fantastic host in everyway.
1690099,Martijn July 2021 Stavros’s studio is really amazing. It is on walking distance to two great beaches and two great restaurants. The studio itself has everything you need. Because it is quite centrally located you can basically go anywhere in Corfu. Stavros helped us renting a car and was always there to help! Overall we had a great holiday!
1690099,Niall July 2021 Really prime location in a lovely quiet area close to nature. The apartment has everything you’ll need from great wifi  air conditioning and cooking facilities. The host (Stravos) went all out to make sure we had everything we needed and was always at hand to answer questions or help out. This was the best AirBnB experience I’ve ever had personally. Can’t recommend this place enough and the fact that its right beside one of the best beaches in Corfu is a massive plus.
1690099,Rebecca Alper October 2020 This was perfect for two of us looking for a relaxed  public transport accessible holiday away from the crowds. We swam in the sea every day and hiked a lot. Even out of season there was plenty to do  and we hiked to the surrounding towns to visit restaurants. Stavros was an amazing host  checking in with us to check we had everything we needed  ensuring we understood where to catch the bus  and providing extra towels half way through our stay. Amazing value and a fantastic holiday. Thank you Stavros.
1690099,Kate October 2020 A very simple place which I loved. Really quiet and just a short walk to the beach (nudist) I loved it. The cooking facilities were unusual. The two hot plates were integral in a 1970’s (?) unit with sink and fridge with slightly fragile Tap on the sink. It was ok cooking for two for two nights but wouldn’t be easy for a family. Another side light would be a good addition to the place. We didn’t get sun in the mornings (in October not sure about rest of the day)!So it was a bit dark but the birdsong made up for this. We enjoyed staying there.
1690099,Stephanie October 2020 Truly exceptional vacation at Stavros' place. Communication beforehand was very fast and easy. At arrival the place was explained to us  we were given a few things to eat and great tips for our vacation on the island. The place was tidy and clean  we had no worries  Stavros was always available. The place is close to a shop  restaurants (great food and prices) and the beach. All in all it was the perfect place to relax and lovely to meet Stavros
1690099,Ronja September 2020 Very nice location near by the sea. Stavros is a very nice and helpful host! Everything was perfect and I will surly come back. Response from Stavros September 2020 Ronja you're always welcome would be a pleasure !!!
1690099,Tomas September 2020 We spend 14days in this studo and it was perfect  location is best i can imagine on Corfu  really calm area  all you need you have available. the closest beach is magic (one of the most beautiful in Corfu). Stavros is available to support you any time. It is definetelly worth to book.
1690099,"Mirka September 2020 The studio was perfect  all what we needed. It's ""in the middle of nowhere"" but still you can see 3 beaches by ""longer"" walk  beautiful places and you can find your spot away from the crowds. The studio is clean  communication with Stavros very nice  great place for a relaxing or active holiday. Highly recommended :) Thank you Stavros :)"
1690099,Petr August 2020 We truly appreciate all that Stavros offered to us - at first picking us up at the airport  then a fridge full of food  amazing studio!! with all the new furniture  garden  good equipment. Nice for a couple  but also for a group of friends or a family. Next and mainly - Stavros! Easy-going person who gave us many useful tips  had a talk with us  always smiling and making jokes. And the location was really good as well. Summarizing it -> perfect  thanks.
1690099,Anixa August 2020 Amazing! Stavros is a superhost! He is super nice and helpful.The studio is very clean and quiet and super close to one of the most beautiful beaches of the island. We will repeat for sure. Thank you Stavros!
1690099,Izabela July 2020 The studio is located in a very good place for people who appreciate nature and privacy  the studio has everything you need. Stavros is a great host that takes care of every detail. I highly recommend this place
1690099,Stephan July 2020 We had amazing days at Stavros‘s place. He warmly welcomed us and helped us with everything. The beach close to his place is amazing and has a really calm vibe going on! Definitely a place you should go to if you’re interested in a peaceful and relaxing holiday trip!
1690099,Paula October 2019 Stavros' place was recommended by some friends who have been there three times and it did not disappoint us; we had a lovely stay in a beautiful area .... Stavros was a super host who could not have done more to be helpful and kept in contact with us during our stay. In particular he collected us from the airport and returned us there (which got our holiday off to a good start). A welcome pack of good  local food was waiting for us when we arrived and it is helpful if Stavros knows if you are vegetarian or vegan. The studio is quiet and in a natural setting. Stavros has provided everything you might need. He also organised a hire car for us which was a lot cheaper than airport car hire. A local bus at the end of the road takes you to Corfu town. The local Myrtiotissa beach is a short walk away and very beautiful; we had some wonderful swims there. It is a steep walk down and back up. There are many steep hikes in Corfu so if you are an older person like I am  I would recommend bringing a hiking stick; you will certainly feel fitter by the end of it!
1690099,Dario October 2019 The studio's location is great and it has everything you need. Shopping and the beach are nearby. Stavros is a super nice host and communication worked perfectly  before and during our stay. We can warmly recommend the place!
1690099,Louise September 2019 Excellent place to stay  especially for those that want to be in a chill peaceful place away from the general tourists. Stavros was great! We were delayed~7 hours and he still met us on arrival. Fridge stocked with some food and beer  a warm welcome with local tips. What more could you ask for?
1690099,Elvis August 2019 11 out of 10! That's airbnb perfection!
1690099,Rui August 2019 Stavros is a dream host. Always happy to help. When I checked in I have some food at home  witch is a nice gesture from him. He gave me some tips to visit the city  the beaches restaurants. For those who nice nature this is a great spot. To go tho the nearest beach (15 min walking) Mirtiotissa beach. I will be back again for sure.
1690099,Gary August 2019 Lovely place. Secluded location. Regular bus at end of road if you don’t have car. Well stocked with coffee  food for arrival which is a ice touch.  Be mindful that check in is before 2pm if you have a late flight.
1690099,Marta August 2019 Cannot recommend Stavros' place enough. He was one of the best host we've ever met and we felt at home in the studio. Just brilliant!!
1690099,Julia July 2019 Just perfect.
1690099,Rachel July 2019 Clean  well equipped studio in a great location for Mirtitossa beach  about a 12 minute downhill walk. 20 minutes uphill back though! Really quiet  peaceful spot which feels safe and secure behind a set of locked gates  with parking space. Comfy bed  air con and nice clean bathroom with shower cubicle. Stavros provides a welcome pack on arrival with fruit  ham  cheese  bread and some wine  very thoughtful. We hope we'll be back someday  thoroughly recommended.
1690099,Maria June 2019 We had a wonderful experience staying here and exploring the nearby beaches and villages. Stavros is a great host and was there to greet us when we arrived and when we left. The place is very comfortable and we felt very relaxed and at peace. The nature around the house is really lush and it was great to be away from town. The nearby tavernas have good food and nice atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again!
1690099,Sam June 2019 Stavros was an excellent host who went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and knowledgeable about the local area. The studio itself was wonderful and stocked up with wonderful treats. The local area has a number of excellent beaches and places to eat  making it the perfect getaway spot. He was always on hand to provide advice and ensured we got to the airport on time  even during the early hours. I have no problem in recommending him or this place again and hope to be back soon :)
1690099,Paola June 2019 Nice and clean studio in very quiet place. Only 15 minutes by walking to Mirtiotissa beach. Stavros is an excellent host!
1690099,Jack June 2019 First time using air BnB outside the UK and was a perfect introduction  if you want an easy stay but away from all the big touristy things then 100% recommend
1690099,Anya May 2019 Beautiful   simple   quiet space. You have all ingridiens for perfect holiday. Hightly recomended.
1690099,Tom May 2019 Stavros' place was perfection; the perfect setting for a relaxing stay on Corfu. It's a very comfortable  compact space with everything one needs. The patio is so comfortable for coffee in the morning and throughout the day. The shower is strong and hot. The kitchenette enabled me to eat at home as much as I wanted. There are plenty of pots and pans and plates and utensils (and Tupperware!) Linda's well-stocked mini-mart is a 5-minute walk in one direction and the beach is a 15-minute walk in the other direction. Spiros 97 is a very good restaurant close by. I spent most of my time on Corfu enjoying nature and going on hikes and this is a perfect base from which to do those things. It's roughly in the north/south center of the island so everywhere was convenient. The road is shady and quiet. And Stavros is charming and helpful and returned every message I left him within minutes. Honestly  I can't say enough good things about this place. If it's available  grab it!
1690099,Ewa April 2019 Staying in this studio was absolutely amazing experience. Its beautifully located in a very rural area close to the beach and mountains. It's generously equipped in everything that a pair of nature loving tourists could want - from beautiful  sparkling clean bathroom  towels  hair dryer  iron  all sorts of pans and mugs and even a toaster and wine opener. Amazing value for money with birds waking you up every morning  fireflies in the night and fantastic host that will take care of you and make you feel welcome and safe. Bless you Stavros I hope we will meet again.
1690099,Lindsey April 2019 Stavros is a perfect gentleman who will help in any way he can. He made contact several times during our stay to make sure we had everything wee needed. The fridge was stocked with some staple items when we arrived and the studio was in good condition and very clean. The studio is set in a very peaceful location but is only a short drive to most destinations although there is a village shop in walking distance.
1690099,Kay April 2019 Great studio if you are looking to get away from all the hustle and bustle. It was roughly a 15 minute walk to a beautiful beach. Stavros was an amazing host. He provided a bunch of local recommendations and even bought us some food which we really appreciated. We highly recommend renting a car or moped so you can explore other parts of the island! Overall  a great value airbnb with an awesome host.
1690099,Mariana November 2018 We had a beautiful time in nature  next to beaches  forests  mountains with trails for long hikes. The accommodation is located really in the middle of nature and you can not hear the noise of cars or planes ... Stavros is a very welcoming and caring person. The equipment of the house is very simple  but functional. We will return!
1690099,Anina September 2018 I had a very nice stay at Stavros Studio. He picked me up at the port and also organized a rental car  which they brought directly to the Studio the next day. (No need to go back to the city to pick it up). That was awesome. There was food for breakfast and lunch in the fridge. I highly recomend it if you like nautre and peace :) thanks for having me!
1690099,Katarzyna September 2018 Cosy studio surrounded by the nice garden. Located close to beautiful different beaches. Recommended using a car or motorbike  because the nearest beach to walk on foot is dedicated mainly to naturists. But going by car you can easily find other beaches in the surrounding . There is a mini market in the distance of 8 min. on foot  opened 7 days a week. The host is very friendly and helpful. Do not be afraid of the food after arriving  because you will find some food products in the fridge submitted by the host.
1690099,Anne August 2018 Relaxed holiday in the nature. Nothing more  nothing less. Stavros is the best host we ever had.
1690099,Aneta July 2018 Great place - nice studio with a garden close to nature and walking distance to the village ( one way) or to the beautiful beach (the other way). Walk back from the beach quite steep but worth the effort. If you have a car great location to explore the island. Great host! I would stay again!
1690099,Mickaël July 2018 Stavros was a good host  very flexible about our arrival and departure  which we very much appreciated. The studio is super well equipped  everything you need and more is there. It is located in very calm and quiet spot  which was perfect with a car. There is also a nice terrace. At our arrival there was also some food available which was a nice touch. Overall we had a good stay  and we recommend the place to others!
1690099,Liz July 2018 Location location location.. The villa is just between 2 beautiful beaches .. and an Amazing host. Stavros is a legend full of tips and sorting all of life’s little storm in a teacup. Close to taverns and a private secluded space. We been to Paxos  Corfu town and our start of holiday was Stavros.. perfect way to start a holiday when he came to pick us up 5.00 am from the airport. Super host .
1690099,Norm July 2018 What a lovely place set in quiet space in the valley. Birds in the morning. Green space all around. Walking distance to Glyfada beach. Had a morning swim at Mirtiotissa beach before it gets crowded. Close to two eating spots. We found the little village of Pelakas 3 - 4 kms down the road. Real authentic Greek village. Greek music   food and old homes nestled on the side of the valley. Just happened to have a cultural festival on our last night. Thank you Stavros for meeting us at the airport. We enjoyed our stay.
1690099,Steven June 2018 An an exceptional host; willing to do that extra little bit for his guests to ensure our stay was pleasant  comfortable and enjoyable.
1690099,Alivia June 2018 simply amazing. couldnt have been better!
1690099,Anya May 2018 Lovely place. Ideal for nature lovers. Quiet and green location. Walking distance to beautiful small beach. Studio has everything you need for a happy holiday - little kitchen  comfortable bed  clean bathrom  hamak and little table outside  even beach parasol. We love it and will come back next year. Stavros is very friendly and helpful. Thank you :-)
1690099,Lai Mia May 2018 Lovely thoughtful host. Had snacks and essentials for us when we arrived  even dropped us to the airport at 4am! Would definitely recommend. Lovely studio very comfortable!!
1690099,Greg May 2018 Stavros deserves the great reviews he has. Very helpful  kind  easy to deal with  and a pleasure to talk to. The place is not huge  but it is a fantastic value (he could easily charge double and it still be worth it) and I hope we are able to stay there again sometime soon. Stavros is on of the best hosts I have dealt with through Airbnb and I have used it quite a lot.
1690099,Olivier May 2018 Nestled in nature  the Stavros studio is a haven of peace! We stayed for a week and enjoyed the island. To discover the majority of coves the rental car is indipensable. Stavros deserves his title of superhost: he picked us up at the airport in the middle of the night  when we arrived  he took the time to explain everything to us including the good plans to visit the island. He had even planned something to eat! Everything was great. We only want to go back with our children next time because suitable for families!  Thank you for everything !
1690099,Laetitia April 2018 Thank you for your welcome  we enjoyed our stay. Stavros is a very nice person. A beautiful meeting  thank you
1690099,Roland April 2018 The numerous positive feedbacks regarding Stavros and his studio in the nature (there are two identical studios wall-to-wall) have proven to be deserved and absolutely reliable. So we shall add this as one more thumbs-up feedback with an ‚efikaristo‘ to our gentle and friendly host Stavros. Nice cosy studio. Lovely nature surrounding it. Calm. Only a twenty minute hike to nice Glyfada beach. Perfect for us (father and two kids  age 10 and 12). We really enjoyed it.
1690099,Nicholas November 2017 Great  accommodating host gives you everything you need!
1690099,Olivia October 2017 I truly believe my time here was my best Airbnb experience to date. Not only did Stavros pick me up from the dock  I was greeted at the studio with a full fridge and the most relaxing ambiance. The studio is in the perfect location  perfect for families  couples  or  like me  the solo traveler! Stavros also gave me great advice on places to see while I was on Corfu and even helped me rent a car  which was delivered right to the studio. I am beyond grateful for my time here and can not wait to make another trip to this beautiful island in the near future! 💙
1690099,Koen October 2017 Amazing place and superb hospitality  thanks Stavros
1690099,John October 2017 We adored our stay and Stavros is a gent and I cannot give him 6 stars but he deserves them. The location is very quiet and this suited us wonderfully and nearby (3 km) is perivales where you find 3 super restaurants (Alexandros  jimmy and the pink panther). It's about 30 mins to Corfu town and a (real) supermarket or there's a corner shop 5 mins walk (aka in Corfu a supermarket). Myriotissa beach was an eye opener and down a very steep hill but worth the effort - or drive and park on the steep path at your peril!!!!! Glyfada beach is the same distance and down a different path and lovely too. Possibly the most beautiful beaches in the world? Had trouble with mosquitos so take some squirty for the evenings. The bed was comfy and the studio appt was wonderful for 2 (there's beds for 4 but you'd need to know the other 3 v well to have more than 2!). Go there - you wont regret it!!
1690099,Marine September 2017 Our time in Korfu was very nice! the Studios are nice  good situed and calm  there were everything we needed. Stavros is nice  guest friendly  he knows the area very good and helped us  answered quickly.
1690099,Katarzyna September 2017 We spent good time  Korfu is beautiful  Studio was good place to rest  Savros is good host  take care about us. Description studio was exact like it was in real. I can recomend this studio ;)
1690099,Veronica August 2017 Stavros is a fantastic host!!! He also left some food and water for us in the fridge and gave us many helpful information ! The house is little but very nice  with a big garden. Above all it has a wonderful position  close to mirtiotissa beach and in the middle of nature. We spent wonderful days at Stavros apartment! Thanks!!!
1690099,Sandy July 2017 We recieved a very good welcome  Stavros came to pick up us in the airport. The house is very pretty and clean  with some food on the fridge for the first day. He also call a taxi for us because we can't find a number. He is helping in all the problem you can have. It was a very good experience and if we have the occasion to come again in Corfu we will rent the same house. Thank you for all!
1690099,Ignacio July 2017 An excepional place for its location if you are looking for quietness. Ideal for relaxing holidays. A great cosy place in the middle of nature. Stavros  the owner is so very helpful and gives good advice. The proximity to an exceptional beach enabled us to go early in the morning and make the best of quiet moments. Exceptional and recommended. THANK YOU STAVROS
1690099,Michał July 2017 Location is perfect. House is perfect. Stavros is the great guy with a big heart. Must be here  meet Stavros  enjoy Corfu island.
1690099,Katerina July 2017 Our stay with my bf in Stavros's studio was very relaxing surrounded by nature and was very clean and comfortable. For the price you get more than you can expect included some food and water ready for you in the fridge. The owner is very friendly and nice person  willing to do anything for you. We can't even imagine better host than Stavros! If we will visit Corfu again then we will definitely stay here! The best beaches close to studio (Myrtiotissa and Pelekas beach was our the most favourite from all Corfu).
1690099,Maurizio July 2017 The location is lovely  and Stavros is a fantastic host. What you see is what you get  place-wise. However  Stavros might surprise you with his kindness and detail oriented mind. Book his place with ease of mind  you won't be disappointed.
1690099,Annie July 2017 Stavros is an incredible host. He picked us up from the ferry and skillfully drove us to our secluded little garden home  which is nestled in nature. He gave us bottled water  beers  vegetables and sandwich fixings for our afternoon on the beach  and there was coffee and plenty of cooking supplies in the kitchen. The room had AC and was very comfortable  and the garden terrace was lovely for breakfast in the morning. A perfectly clean  sparkling  clothing-optional beach is a 15 minute walk from the house  and plenty of people on their way down offered us rides in their cars. We had our last dinner in Greece at a beautiful restaurant a short minute walk up the hill called Spiros Taverna 97 - also highly recommended. This was a perfect end to a very dreamy trip - would highly recommend!!
1690099,Konstantin June 2017 Spending 10 days at Stavros’ house was the best airbnb experience for me so far. The house is fully equipped for a relaxing holiday. On the arrival the fridge was full with groceries for few days including fruits  vegetables  cheese  eggs  water  wine... The house is literary in the nature  with a big garden  quiet  with no neighbors  and still close to fabulous Mirtiotissa beach  market  taverns… Stavros is a great host  easy to communicate  fun  and always available to help. He welcomed us and gave us interesting and useful information about the island. I definitely recommend the Stavros’ house in the nature
1690099,Sam June 2017 Great stay!! Very relaxing.
1690099,Kath June 2017 So lovely to be staying at stavros' studio again! Stavros looked after us SO well with lifts to and from the airport  a fridge full of goodies and a very clean   well equipped apartment. Idyllic surroundings.... didn't want to leave !!
1690099,Anya May 2017 The place was perfect for us - clean  modern enough  quiet  private. Stavros is the best host we could imagine - helpful  friendly but respecting our privacy. He is there for you if you need him - very reassuring for first time traveler. It was very helpful to find breakfast food for our vegan meal first day. Very considerate. Thank you. Studio seems to be perfect for nature lovers. It is serine and green with a bit of private area around. Stunningly beautiful beach is near by and interesting walks starting from here. Corfu town is 25 minutes away. We used our own car but one can travel by local bus. I would highly recommend Stavros place to all my friends . Read description - and if you like sound of it - you will love the place . We would love to go there again next year. Thank you lots  Anya  UK.
1690099,Ingrid May 2017 Thank you so much Stavros: it was not just perfect: it was fun : )
1690099,Dean May 2017 This has been my best Airbnb experience yet. Stavros is a kind and caring host and will make sure everything is perfect for you. The house is cozy and the location is picturesque. The most incredible beach is about a 10 minute walk away. The water is crystal clear so I recommend bringing goggles for scuba diving. There is a fairly challenging hike up the mountain near the house that leads to a 12th century church. You can see Albania from the top of the mountain. Worth the walk. I can't really imagine anyway an Airbnb could be any better than this. Highly recommend
1690099,Stephen May 2017 Stavros is the perfect host - friendly  helpful and generous. Apartment was well stocked with essentials for our stay  including breakfasts. Lovely  quiet location (with fireflies); clean and comfortable; well-equipped kitchen. A great stay!
1690099,Andi April 2017 Great host  beautiful place to stay...
1690099,Gudr November 2016 Fluent communication with the host. Very clean and comfortable place with airco and/or heating and a practical mini-kitchen. The place was a little difficult to find when we arrived late at night  but the host was so kind to meet us on the road.
1690099,Hélène October 2016 Perfect host  very nice and full of attention. He helped us to find all we needed in Corfu  I recommend! And the studio was also very nice  clean and calm. Thank you Stavros!
1690099,Nick August 2016 This is a must Stavros is the best host in Corfu and makes your stay even more enjoyable. Stavros is a fantastic host. If the rating was out of 10 he would receive 12 from us. He says it is his job but it's more like a passion for him. He picked us up from the airport and had food and drink waiting for us in the fridge. He made our stay in Corfu much better than we could have imagined. He helped us with everything we needed and we felt like we could ring him at any point if we needed anything for the apartment or even advice. The apartment was fantastic and was everything as described. Stavros was our host when we arrived but when we left it felt we was leaving a good friend. Super host does not justify Stavros he is much much more!! The area is just as described and is a paradise in nature. Transport is advised but the beach is still in walking distance. Stavros was our host when we arrived but now consider him to be a good friend. He did everything and more than we expected from him we felt like at home but we were in paradise. We recommend staying at Stavros's apartment he makes your holiday unforgettable.
1690099,Coe August 2016 There is only one thing better than the house...the host  Stavros will make you love this amazing spot even more.
1690099,Yana July 2016 There is little to add to all the excellent reviews of the place and its host. A little heaven on earth  suitable for couples but also for families with children. Coming back from the beach (10-15 min uphill) may be a challenge if you do not have a car or a scooter but this is why the area is so intact by tourist. The scenery is amazing and for us this is the best region of Corfu. Efharisto poli  Stavros!
1690099,Patryk July 2016 Perfect!!! STAVROS knows meaning of word Holiday!!
1690099,Gosia June 2016 House is amazing - located in the nature as described  close to wonderful beach Mirtiotissa. This place is perfect for those  who would like to fully relax and prefer quiet than noise of tourist resorts. Stavros is very nice person - he is the best example of perfect host :)
1690099,Rob May 2016 No-one could have been more welcoming than Stavros. The perfect host  he greeted us at the gate and explained all the delights of his wonderful B&B including a full fridge of goodies! The studio was just perfect with every facility and all in excellent condition. We stayed in some lovely places during our 16-day Corfu holiday but this was unquestionably the best for both comfort and location  right in some beautiful country yet within half an hour's walk of the beach and incredible cliff walks. We were disappointed that we could stay only two nights with Stavros - we would have loved a longer time there. If we could give Stavros six stars we would!
1690099,Bronwyn May 2016 Stavros was a welcoming  friendly and extremely generous host. He offered to pick us up from the airport in the middle of the night because our flight arrived late and when it could not land due to bad weather came the next day to get us. The studio sits amongst olive trees in an area of corfu with little tourism and very sweet friendly village locals. We arrived to a beautifully clean  sunny studio with a fridge full of supplies including everything needed for a delicious greek salad! He was constantly reachable and gave us great tips about where to go  hiring bicycles/scooters/car. The nudist beach is small and beautiful and 10min walk from the house.  We would love to come back and stay there again  absolutely fantastic accommodation. Thanks again Stavros!!!
1690099,Eliška May 2016 Stavros is amazing host. He picked us up at the airport  did first shopping of groceries for us  showed around and explained everything.  House is located in small village  surrounded by breathtaking nature. There is everything you need - bed linen  towels  hairdryer  blankets  pillows. Kitchen is well equipped also - seasonings  oils  sugar  tea  coffee.
1690099,"Will May 2016 Me and my girlfriend recently stayed for a week at Stavros' apartment. We had the most fantastic time and rest assured Stavros will do all he can to take good care of you upon your arrival and give you all information needed when you stay(and food).  All the things that can worry you about arriving on holiday are taken care of. We were picked up from the airport promptly upon our arrival and taken back in good time before our flight. There was fresh fruit  vegetables and food in the apartment for us and we were given plenty of great information about the surrounding area and visits into Corfu town which is only a short bus ride away.  The apartment is 5 minutes walk from the beach and very a cheap mini market  restaurants etc.  It was our first holiday abroad as a couple and Stavros does everything to make sure we had a fantastic time and for this I not only want to return but I am also very very thankful for a great time. Peace out Stavros ""the Greek""and thank you for everything.  Super host is an understatement!  Show more"
1690099,Irene October 2015 Stavros place is really in the middle of nature. It is at the end of a small valley  filled with olive trees and cyclamen patches. You hear the birds  you can sit in the green  and the beach is 10 minutes walk away. The most beautiful and quiet beach of Corfu that is  Mirtiotissa beach! We arrived late in the evening  we were so happy that Stavros had arranged a full fridge for us! Everything was there to start a good holiday. The studio is just right for two persons. A nice kitchen  a very nice blanket and everything cleaned very well. Stavros is a very attentive host  and also speaks a little Dutch ;) It was so nice of him to take care of us  we also had a problem with the key  he solved it while we were on the beach. We will return Stavros  good luck and thank you for everything!
1690099,George October 2015 Stavros was the ultimate super host! He picked us up from the airport on arrival and made us feel warm and right at home immediately. We arrived quite late in the evening to Corfu and most restaurants were closed  but luckily Stavros had thought ahead and provided us with delicious dinner provisions  meats  fresh tomatoes  cheese  fresh bread and fruit. Delicious! He helped us organise a car for an excellent price and showed us great places to visit on the island. Stavros also organised for his mum to wash all our dirty clothes free of charge- his kindness and hospitality was the best we have experienced on air b and b. I do not hesitate in recommending this host to anyone  the place was so lovely and quiet and very clean. It is close to two beautiful beaches and an easy location to reach the rest of the island. We had an awesome time  and can't wait to go back. Overall  an outstanding experience!!! Thanks so much Stavros :))
1690099,Kati September 2015 Stravos is the nicest and best host of hole Korfu! You will not find a person who is so warmhearted  caring and sharing then Stravos. From the very first moment he made us feel more than welcome and during our stay he always took care that we felt comfortable and save. The apartment was more then clean  very cosy  just perfect! There is everything and more what made us feel at home. The wunderful garden around the house with trees and flowers and palms was one of our favourites. The nature is unbelievable! The beautiful Mirtiotissa Beach which is near took our breath alway! It is just unbelievable  christelblue water  sourounded by magnificent extraordinary nature! Very near is also Daniels small monestry  which is worth visiting. If you ever visit Korfu  please look no longer for accomodation  Stravos place is probably the best place where you can go!!! We really felt in love with everything! Thanks for your open-minded personality  your help in any belongs  your warm welcome  the perfect studio and your unbelievable hospitality! You are the best host ever! Hope to see you again!
1690099,Sarah September 2015 Go without hesitation to Stavros’s house! It is a very very nice place inside olives’ trees and corfu nature. We loved it!! Stavros made our stay very easy by caring a lot about us and he is a very nice guy  very friendly! Thanks Stavros!!!
1690099,Josipa August 2015 Stavros is such a nice host and his apartmament is perfect  clean  well equipped  with a little kitchen and full fridge that welcomed us :) terrace and garden are sooo beautiful and our best time in corfu was there  just chilling and enjoying! Location is also great  just in the middle of everything and 15 min drive from corfu town. Thank you stavros for everythink  kisses from croatia!!
1690099,Kiran July 2015 We had a really good time at Stavros apartment. The location is fantastic and the host gentle and sympatic! I would defenetly go again :D thank you!
1690099,Katie July 2015 Stavros was a brilliant host from the word go! The apartment was perfect for what we were after and really was relaxing and just a few minutes walk to the beautiful Mirtiotissa beach (be warned - the hill is not for the faint hearted but will help wear off the effects of the Retsina!). Sadly we were only able to stay for three nights but would genuinely consider returning one day as we never got chance to visit the rest of the island - we were far too busy bronzing on the beach! Stavros welcomed us with a smile and a well stocked fridge and very kindly provided us with a transfer to the airport on our last morning which was very much appreciated. If you are considering a trip to Corfu I would highly recommend Stavros and his lovely studio!
1690099,Andreas June 2015 Five Stars! Stavros is the Perfect host  and the Studio was Fine for us all  a Family with two children  busstop  Mini market and Beach near!
1690099,Jorg June 2015 The house was beyond our expectations! If you are looking for a private experience and away from the daily trouble look no further. Stravos provided a warm welcome from the moment he picked us up. On our drive back  he pointed out various points of interest and gave us fresh bread and various spreads for breakfast. The Mirtiotissa beach is just few minutes walk away  with a gorgeous little sandy beach surounded by nature. The house itself is amazing  new  clean and fully equipped. We can't wait to go back some day!
1690099,Niels October 2014 The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1690099,Lauriane September 2014 The perfect location close to Glyfada Beach (the nicest one on Corfu)  the lovely apartment and Stavros (a.k.a. the Host) made our days in Corfu into über-relaxed vacations. Epharisto Stavros ! :)
1690099,Carlo September 2014 Stavros had sent us a rather intimidating set of instructions to reach his house which we disregarded  relying instead on our GPS. Corfu is the one place where you will never regret the investment in a good GPS. Stavros proved to be a perfect host  nice  always available  smiling and funny. We could not have hoped for better. His description of the apartment was very positive but reality vastly surpassed expectations. The location is great  half way between Kerkyra  the main town  and Paleakastritsa to the north. The apartment is in the the forest  quiet and peaceful but you soon find out that the beach (Myrtiotissa nude beach) is within walking distance. A good climb  on the way back  but a great exercise. We never used the car to go to the beach. If you prefer a more family oriented set-up glitzy Glyfada beach is easily reached by car. Stavros apartment is very well equipped and nothing is missing. He gave us a WiFi egg which was a godsend. A mini market is nearby where you can find most of what you need but large supermarkets (Lidl  Diellas  Markato etc) can be reached in 15 minutes. Stavros gave us his WiFi egg and this proved of invaluable help. We really enjoyed our stay in Corfu and we are already thinking of going back. At Stavros place  of course. Show more
1690099,Deborah August 2014 Stavros was amazing! A great host  who went out of his way to give us clear directions to get to the house  showed us where everything was  even bought us garbage bags when we ran out! He checked up on us and made us feel right at home. He was very accommodating  and hospitable. Made our stay in Greece feel right at home.

It really all worked out  from the directions/bus line from the airport to the apartment in advance  then the great reception and with everything you need for the first day on vacation! The apartment is so beautifully located in the nature of Corfu that you can really switch off. I really loved everything about it:) the apartment was super clean and there was everything you need. The Mirtiotissa beach is about 10-15 min. away and really very nice.

1690099,Aurelie July 2022 Quiet accommodation  surrounded by nature  not far from 2 very good taverns and 2 beaches (quite steep  bring good shoes!)

1690099,Tina June 2022 The studio is very well located - in the middle of the countryside and close to 2 very different beaches. It was clean and well equipped - we filled up very well there. Nearby are 2 tavernas and a supermarket  so you don't miss anything. Kerkyra can also be reached quickly by bus.  Stavros was always there for us if we needed anything. I am thrilled with the Greek hospitality all over the island and look forward to the next trip there. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Patricia October 2021 The accommodation is rather quieter/more rural  which makes the charm absolutely. Stavros is a very friendly  helpful and fun host. Everything you could need is available in the accommodation. We also had water and something to eat for the first day in the refrigerator of Stavros. The beach is about 10-15 min walk away and really beautiful. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Iris August 2021 The apartment is simple and simply perfect! We felt very comfortable right away. Stavros is a perfect host and takes care of his guests.

We felt completely comfortable and will gladly repeat Translated from German  Show original

1690099,Jarosław August 2019 the host is very nice and helpful and it is ok  the location is quiet and calm  a little walking  we like it  we just like it  Glifada beach is quite steep but you can do it next to it  there is a nudist beach next to it so not for us with kids  next to a toddler as an alternative to the non-professional. when it comes to the cottage  it's actually one room and the bathroom we slept in. but for some people  it might seem a bit too small. An old stove model but working. The younger daughter was terrified. Unfortunately  it's everywhere in Corfu. Translated from Polish  Show original
1690099,Melanie July 2019 What hospitality!!!! Rightly a SUPERHOST! Stavros makes you feel at home from the 1st moment until you leave. The fridge was richly stocked  and wowww what a privacy  in the middle of nature!! The cottage has everything you need  an ideal base from which to explore Corfu! Stavros thank you for everything  we will definitely come back! Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Mickael July 2019 Perfect accommodation with nothing missing  excellent welcome  thank you very much Stavros. Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Olga June 2019 A beautiful quiet secluded place in nature  close to a picturesque wild sandy beach (the left part is for nudists  fenced with rocks). There is also another sandy beach nearby  equipped  with hotels around. The road to both beaches is quite sloping. There was already food and water on arrival  which is very convenient when you arrive late. There is a shop nearby 10 min walk  works until late. There is a place to relax both outside and inside. Thank you very much Stavros for your hospitality and comfortable accommodation! Translated from Russian  Show original
1690099,Mat October 2018 The place is exactly as it was described. The space and amenities are in perfect condition  the surroundings are fantastic. The guest friendliness radiates from everything.

1690099,Imkea October 2018 The cottage is great for 2 people. A very nice shower and everything well taken care of. Stavros is also possible in Dutch. Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Margitta Und Uli October 2018 The place was exactly as described. The studio was easy to find with Stavro's location via maps. Stavros is an excellent host  he personally greeted and instructed us on arrival. We got tips for excursions  restaurants  beaches  etc.  The communication with Stavros was very good via mail and WhatsApp. We were pleased with a great selection of fresh food on arrival. Basic equipment of everything necessary (spices  tea  vinegar  oil  toilet paper  detergent  etc.) was also available. The studio is very functional and there is everything you need for a relaxing vacation.  There are even umbrellas and a small cooler for the beach. Bed linen and towels can be changed during the stay if necessary. Nearby is a small but very well-equipped supermarket.  The path to Mirtiotissa beach is not far on foot  but very steep. You should be good on foot. We found the beach to be very nice  but it was unfortunately very crowded and tight even in the off-season. Only 4 kilometers by car is the beach of Glyfada  where you have much more space (at the end also possible nudist)  Unfortunately  there is hardly any sun on the property in the morning and evening (at least in September).  Overall  you can fully recommend the place and the host Stavros. It is ideal for people who like to be in nature. A car is a great advantage.  We would like to thank Stavros again for the two relaxing weeks. Show more Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Sophie May 2018 Stavros is a welcoming and very friendly person. Her studio is an ideal place to relax  admire nature while being close to beaches and walking trails.

In short  we highly recommend Stavros place and studio! Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Anne April 2018 Danielo is a perfect host: attentive  patient (he waited until two in the morning because our plane was late)  available and always smiling  he did everything to make our stay a success  until he left us something to eat for the first days in more quantity. The garden is the second room of the studio: terrace table and chairs for meals  hammock  sun loungers... ideal for lounging! Bringing a few muscles to get to the beach - it can be won! Go there without so much as a second thought  it's just perfect. Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Louis November 2017 Stavros is a beautiful person; he is very attentive and makes every effort to ensure that the stay goes smoothly: explanations for the itinerary  warm welcome with food in the fridge and a bottle of wine! Recommended! Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Carola October 2017 Stavros studio is perfect for living Corfu surrounded by nature. The best welcome I've received from a Host so far. The studio is essential but with everything you need and Stravos is kind and thoughtful. It's best to have a car to get around  even if it's Translated from Italian  Show original
1690099,Michaela October 2017 A great place for nature lovers  with lots of greenery and shade. The beach is probably the best one on the island  tiny  sandy. Accommodation is standard  big courtyard is also good for games. Stavros is great  responsive  and most importantly  he has prepared some basic groceries and water for us so we don't have to go to the store right away. Translated from Czech  Show original
1690099,Stéphane September 2017 Beautiful apartment a few minutes' walk away (it descends on the way  it climbs back) from one of the most beautiful beaches in Corfu (nudist  but not that  it's a public beach). In nature  quiet  extremely well equipped  perfect internet connection  close to shops and taverns (by car it's best if you want to eat very well)  this rental is ideal for couples or small families with 2 children. Thank you Stavros  we will come back without hesitation (this is already the second time we are coming  but at the time we did not book with Airbnb). Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Els May 2017 For us  Stavros' apartment was an example of the difference between being good and enthusiastic about something. We are enthusiastic.

Committed  hospitable  helpful and pleasant & fast in communication. He lives up to the announced promises! Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Eric April 2017 The Studio de Stavros is really very well located  clean and very pleasant. The city of is in Corfu is 20 minutes away and the island is really very beautiful. Stavros is really charming (He picked us up from the airport!...) as well as all the people we met a small beach next to the studio is very nice (nudist the beach!...)  in the village there is a nice bar and restaurant and a small grocery store where you can all find it. Our week-long stay in April was very sunny but not too hot so for this period you need to bring warm clothing for the morning and evening and short for the afternoon. So I would recommend this destination and the Stavros studio to everyone Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Véronique April 2017 Stavros is a lovely host  available and caring about our comfort. Her studio is simple but well-equipped and very clean. It is ideally located for discovering Corfu. Recommended without hesitation. Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Marine August 2016 We stayed 3 nights with my 5 year old daughter. For who owns a car the place is beautiful and really away from the tourist traffic of the island. The terrace is superb and flowery  the apartment very clean and comfortable and the presence of air conditioning a more pleasant. Stavros was particularly welcoming and attentive; the fridge was even full on arrival! He also helped us find a new place to stay during the busy travel season. A place to recommend without hesitation Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Lucie July 2016 Stavros is a great place to stay  location is nice  beautiful beach in walking distance  peace and quiet. Translated from Czech  Show original
1690099,Elsbeth July 2016 Want to discover Corfu as it's intended? Stay in a beautiful place that is full of comforts and close to the most beautiful beach? Do you like arriving at a place where the fridge is full of tasty things and warm and welcoming but not obtrusive? Then I warmly recommend this place! We have enjoyed this place in the green nature. Plenty of space and shade or sun  just what you want. Beach  hiking trail  mini market and eateries within walking distance. Rest of the island to be prepared within max 45 minutes. Cottage is neatly decorated and clean. The kitchen is at your disposal and all basic items  herbs  oil  towels  etc. are provided. The wifi was fast beyond expectations. By the way  you don't need it for tips because Stavros can help you with that in a pleasant way (not too present but cozy and available if you want). You can park in the shade in front of the door  but you can also be picked up/brought from the airport or boat. If we go to Corfu again  we will definitely come back.

1690099,Patricia May 2016 Stavros' house was the best of the ones we were in Corfu  by far! It is in a beautiful place  close to the beach and is the perfect place to relax and get to know the whole island from.  The house has everything you might need and Stavros is a lovely host. When we return to Corfu we will repeat with Stavros! Translated from Spanish  Show original
1690099,Anja May 2016 My break in Stavros' studio was simply pure relaxation and relaxation thanks to its commitment and support as well as the preparation and loving care of this small paradise! The communication in advance about arrival and possibilities on site already gave me a good and relaxed feeling. As a super service I found it to be picked up from the airport and brought back  even in the morning at 7am. A big surprise was the all-round supply with basic groceries  so I could just go on vacation without having to go shopping. The kitchen equipment including things you don't actually want to buy on vacation but need for cooking was great - various oils  salt  spices  teas  just thought of everything. I find the studio itself tastefully decorated. It radiates a friendly welcome atmosphere  so I also enjoyed staying in there during some rainy hours. The quite cool evenings were comfortably tolerable thanks to heating fans. Breakfast on the terrace in the middle of the countryside overlooking the colorful hammock  which made a really good mood  or the evenings where the dark garden sparked with fireflies - everything contributed to an intense feeling of well-being! Laundry detergent in the bathroom  an extra umbrella for the beach  towel change after three days - so many small details that I didn't expect  but I was wonderfully pleased about! Stavros has asked several times if I still need anything  was always available and answered all concerns very promptly. He seemed willing to organize pretty much everything for me as a guest as possible. His tips on the local and wider area including checking bus schedules and explanations for safe stay at various places were super helpful. Stavros was open to constructive improvement ideas  which I liked very much. Overall  I really liked his easy  friendly manner and  in particular  I liked the respect and goodwill with which he informed us of our presence in the other studio. So no question  Superhost is more of a minimum rating  in Stavros Studio and with him as a contact person there is nothing missing! A thousand thanks to you  dear Stavros - I highly recommend your house to everyone! I'd love to come by again to relax! THANK YOU!!! Show more Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Elena September 2015 Stavros is a great host. He has really thought of everything  every little thing and was always friendly and helpful. This apartment is very good in terms of value for money  we particularly liked the terrace and the location (very quiet). We also liked the beach closest to it best: fine sand  clear water and some rocks on the sides where you can visit various fish and crab with a diving glasses. Stavros will tell you what the area offers. We would recommend this place. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,"Hein September 2014 A very warm welcome was the start of our stay with Stavros. Surprisingly  he also spoke Dutch. Excellent and clean studio  clean bed and otherwise well equipped.

49451625,Katherine July 2022 Perfect one bedroom apartment minutes from the beautiful Glyfada beach. It's a beautiful place and the apartment had everything we needed and Maria and Stavros were very helpful answering questions about getting around the island. It was the perfect  relaxing escape from a busy life. We also enjoyed watching a few films on Netflix which was an additional bonus I hadn't expected! We will be back for sure!

49451625,Rob May 2022 Fantastic apartment with simply stunning views. Mapia was really helpful and met us very late at night to show us the apartment and our parking space. The welcome bottle of wine was a nice touch. Very impressive broadband speed (22mbs) and very effective quiet air conditioning. A hire car is necessary in off peak periods. Thoroughly recommend both the host and apartment.
49451625,Aurélien April 2022 Very clean apartment  beautifully located! Maria was welcoming  and available  in addition to her good advice. The beach and the view are sublime  the place is quiet  the parking beach is a plus. A great week in a great place!
49451625,Michaela April 2022 we had a very nice stay and maria was a very nice host!

49451625,Tom October 2021 Fantastic location with great views of Glyfada - we loved being able to walk less than 5 minutes to the beach for a swim. Transport to Corfu Town is also easily accessible with bus stop close by.  Maria and Stavros' apartment was well equipt with everything we needed for our stay. They met us from our connection and made sure we could get food and supplies etc which was much appreciated. We had an amazing holiday and look forward to returning in future. Would recommend this stay and hosts to others.
49451625,Piotr October 2021 This place is a cozy & comfortable apartament with the beautiful view and 2 mins from the beach. You drink your morning coffee seating on the sunny balcony and watching waves. Highly recommend!
49451625,Jasper October 2021 Perfect flat for a few relaxed days by a beautiful beach! Maria and Stavros are excellent hosts and made everything easy. We would recommend getting a car as Glyfada itself is very quiet  but there's a picturesque village  Pelekas  5 minutes drive away with good restaurants and tavernas.
49451625,Christopher September 2021 Ionian Senses is a nice  clean and comfy apartment in Glyfada. Communication with Maria and Stavros was easy and warm.
49451625,Ricarda August 2021 We stayed at Maria’s apartment for one week in august and had a really nice and relaxing time. The apartment is very sweet and comfortable  we had everything we needed (including extra towels  a welcome wine&water  oil/spices/coffee  and sun-umbrellas to take to the beach!) and Maria was very friendly und trustful. Plus the balcony with sea view was amazing. :)  The area or „village“ of Glyfada itself was a little different than we expected it to be but since we had a car rented we were able to get to other places if we wanted to.
49451625,Miguel August 2021 Perfect! Everything we needed was in the apartment. Super close to the beach!
49451625,Leoni August 2021 Due to personal circumstances I couldn't go to Greece. However  Maria was very understanding and accommodating. My friends went anyway and loved their stay! I hope to visit her lovely apartment someday :)
49451625,Bjarke August 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Mαρία’s apartment. She had great hospitality and gave us some great tips. The place was spotless and we got water and wine for us when we arrived :) The area is nice  it is one of the best beaches in Corfu. A sandy beach and a lot of space  with fever hotels around than other beaches. And with Pelekas just around the corner  and every other destination on the island within a driveable distance  this place has a perfect location.
49451625,Pia July 2021 Lovely  small apartment with amazing views. We almost lived on the balcony. Lovely resort and the most amazing sandy Beach with crystal clear water. Pelekas (the village up the hill) has many lovely restaurants. Maria is a good host - easy check in  wine om the table and she is ready to answer questions and give good advice about sightseeing and restaurants
49451625,Anna Christina June 2021 The apartment is small and kept to its basics but the view and balcony doesn't get much better. If you are looking for a great view this is the place for you! Maria and Stavros are extremely nice and always fast to reach ☺️
49451625,Sarah May 2021 We arrived in Glyfada quite late in the evening but Maria and Stavros met us at the apartment to greet us and show us the place. We did not rent a car at first and didn't prepare for all the restaurants and supermarkets nearby to be closed  as we traveled to corfu in late May and the season was just about to start. Also  due to COVID-19  there was not a lot of tourism  so we assumed that this was another reason for the beach restaurants and markets to be closed (it almost felt like a private beach  so amazing!). Our hosts kindly gave us a ride to the nearest village that night  so we could get some groceries and have dinner in one of the tavernas. They also arranged a rental car for us the next day (which I highly recommend while in corfu!). The apartment was perfect: literally a few steps to the beach  situated in a cozy resort  which felt more like a small village. The big balcony was amazing  you can see the whole sandy beach and the turquoise sea from there. Apartment 84 was equipped with everything we needed  the only minor thing we would have wished for was a better shower  as the one on site had to be held in one hand and the water pressure was quite low. Other than that there is nothing for us to complain about. We had the best stay at Maria's and Stavro's place and enjoyed corfu to the fullest. If you are looking for exceptional hosts and beautiful views - you've found the right place! Show more
49451625,Romain May 2021 We had a very nice stay at Maria’s apt 84. The view on the beach is just amazing  the appartment is clean and calm. The parking is very close to the home so it makes a very good place to go anywhere. Maria is a very kind person that helped us to spend great holidays there.

49451625,Patricia August 2022 Very available host. great tips for sightseeing and restaurants. Wonderful view from the beautiful terrace on Glyfada beach. I highly recommend this place which was very clean. Translated from French  Show original
49451625,Lars May 2022 We had a very nice time here with Maria & Stravos! We were expected in an easy to find place and after that the parking was shown to us. A rental car would be recommended here. The apartment is great with a mega view  but the sound of the waves doesn't make you feel disturbed at night (even a plus for us). There are of course also some tips on things to do and restaurants from the hosts. We would love to choose Maria & Stravos as hosts again on our next Corfu trip!

16991160,Indre September 2022 The most amazing villa we had ever stayed. Stunning views of the sea. Susi and Dominic was so lovely and helpful with whatever we needed  really nice couple. We loved It so much it’s was just amazing
16991160,Annie September 2022 The setting of this beautiful house is stunning with amazing views  stylish interior sand a fantastic pool it was a magical place to relax. It is isolated and that is a huge part of the appeal. It was the perfect place to come back to after busy  hot days exploring the island. Susi and her husband are kind and enthusiastic hosts. Nothing was too much trouble  from booking restaurants and water taxis for us to always providing spot on recommendations for places to visit. We really felt we made the most of our time in Corfu guided and helped by Susi.
16991160,David July 2022 Just perfect. Amazing view  beautiful pool  spacious interior and Susi was a brilliant host. Already planning a return trip
16991160,Jack June 2022 We had the most wonderful time staying at Susi and Dominique’s villa  truly a perfect holiday!  The villa itself was clean  homely  and looks like it should be in a magazine. We came with our two and four year old daughters who absolutely loved the pool and Susi and Dominique were kind enough to get out extra toys for them to play with which they were very excited by! They were both so accommodating and lovely  it made us feel so welcome.  The view over the mountains and ocean from the pool is simply stunning and we spent many evenings admiring the landscape after cooking on the bbq.  We really loved going down to Glyfada beach which was perfect for the kids and only about a 20 minute drive away through olive groves and other beautiful scenery.  Thank you so much Susi and Dominique for an unforgettable stay in Corfu  and especially for all of the delicious home-made treats! Show more Response from Susi June 2022 Thank you so much Camilla and Jack. We had a great time with you and the kids.
16991160,Xerxes October 2021 Beautiful place and the view is even better than the pictures. Susi was extremely hospitable and made our time in Corfu one to remember. Highly recommend
16991160,Fredrik August 2021 Amazing house for our vacation in Greece! Susi is a fantastic host who is incredibly helpful to book boat rentals and recommend places to visit and to eat. The illuminated swimmingpool is the perfect place to have a few beers in after dark after a day of Corfu adventures. Generous outside space with multiple sitting areas and a large propane grill. I recommend booking a smaller hatchback car  because the streets of Corfu are very very narrow and at the popular spots also crowded. This location is impossible without a rental car. Response from Susi August 2021 Thank you  Fredrik  for your public and private feedback. - We know that without AC its difficult for some guest and we will think about to install an AC. On the other hand  the airbnb advertise sais that there is no AC and August in Greece can be very hot. - Until now  the WIFI was working without problems  except some days when they do maintenance. This sommer we had some guests who had to work a few days and they didn' t complain. I'm really sorry that you had problems with the WIFI. For the 4G  we can't do anything  a lot of areas in Corfu dont have any connection. We live in the wild  away from pollution and noise  but have to accept some disadvantage. - The wasps are a problem for some people and we really try to do our best to limit her spreading killing the queens in springtime and putting wasp traps on our side of the house and every day some hundreds are killed inside this traps.  I wish you a nice indian summer and wish you all the best.  Susi Show more
16991160,Giulia July 2021 Wonderful place & wonderful hosts! If you are somebody you likes to be in nature and doesn't mind having to drive to go for food or a restaurant this is a special place....the view and the pool are among the best in Corfu. Susy and Dominque next door are very gracious hosts who went out of their way to help us out and respected our privacy at all times. We left happy and full of stories to share!
16991160,Geoff August 2020 Beautiful Hosts  wonderful location  don’t want to write too much as everyone will want to stay! Geoff
16991160,Daniel August 2020 We spent a week in Susi beautiful house. The location is stunning  the view is amazing and Susi is not just a great host but also great source of tips and inspiration. We felt home right away.
16991160,Philippine August 2020 Fabulous and Holidays!!! We are used to travel with Airbnb but this is the best we’ve been! The hospitality of Susi and her husband Dominique is lovely. They are so sweet and so discrete in the same time.but always here when you need them! And the house is incredible...the view  the nature around  the house inside is so practical and beautiful.we have a one year old baby and I’m 6months pregnant of the second: this house made us the life so simple and we could really rest and relax. We are planning to come back! We loved Corfu!
16991160,Milo July 2020 We had a fantastic trip in Corfu  the house met all expectations and the view was indescribable.  Susi was a super host and provided us with the best tips for our trip every day. 10/10
16991160,Phillip October 2019 Susi is probably the best host you can find on the island and so is the view!!! The outdoor space is not fully private but the hosts make up for it with their kindness and helpfulness. Corfu can be very busy in summer  so this house offers a rare opportunity to get away from the masses and be more in nature and surround by local villages. Very unique!
16991160,Laura September 2019 My family and I stayed here for a week and it is a beautiful location. Warning  you will need a car to get there! Well worth it for the views  the sun rises and sun sets! We were met by Susi at a local village where we followed her to the house (we would have definitely not found it by ourselves) as it was late  she gave us a quick tour of the house and left us to get some sleep. The next day she took some time to give us a welcome chat which was great and enabled us to get some good tips of where to go and what to see. The property was squeaky clean and tastefully furnished. The amenities at the property were good and we were able to enjoy a nice Sunday afternoon BBQ. The kitchen is a little small and wouldn't lend itself to cooking a big family meal (no oven) but was completely adequate for our needs as we ate out most lunchtimes. Susi and Dominique were consummate hosts and didn't leave us wanting for anything  even a daily service of freshly filtered water. If you are looking for a beautiful  relaxing place to stay whilst on Corfu then this is the place for you.
16991160,Laura July 2019 The house is fabulous   exactly like the pictures. The view is breathtaking  the swimming pool is just superb and warm ! It is a very relaxing and quiet atmosphere. Susi and Dominique are great hosts  always smiling and there to help. Susi gave us a lot of tips and beaches to visit and we were really happy with her ideas. Thank you so much for this great week in Corfou!
16991160,Brad July 2019 The location and views are AMAZING! We loved the pool  patio  outdoor grilling and the star gazing at night! Susi is a gracious host and provided prompt communication  great local recommendations and thoughtful assistance. If you're looking for something private and even a bit rustic this is a wonderful place. Please note that you will need a car as the amazing views do come with a somewhat remote location.
16991160,Vicki June 2019 Susi was a fantastic host with excellent local knowledge of beaches  boats and restaurants. The villa is perched on top of a hill over looking the coast. Lovely pool area to soak up the sun. You definitely need a car for this location. The villa met all our expectations. A perfect get away.
16991160,Jamie September 2018 Susi and Dominic were extremely welcoming  thoughtful and accommodating throughout our stay. We were impressed even before our arrival when Susi offered to go shopping and purchase some items of our choice for arrival.  Susi’s passion for her guests welfare and comfort is evident in every interaction  I felt she was always looking for opportunities to improve our stay E.G. Offering local tips/ guidance/ restaurant recommendations and offering to replenish household items. Welcome nibbles  drinks and chat were a very nice touch and civilised way to begin the holiday.  The House is beautiful inside and out and truly fits in with the surrounding area. The house is well appointed and offered all of the amenities we could wish for. Despite being quite ‘ bijoux’ in size  the kitchen was very well equipped and allowed us to make several meals with ease. Noteworthy that the kitchen knives were actually sharp  not always the case in Air BnB accommodations! We were a little apprehensive about not having Air Conditioning  though having the doors open created a nice draft and the ceiling fans provided sufficient cooling. It was pleasant being able to have an ‘open house’ in this regard rather than having to keep everything closed up.  We stayed with our 3 month old daughter  our first trip with her. The house was definitely suitable for an infant. Susi provided a cot bed  bedding and mosquito net. She also provided a small paddling pool which was a nice touch. No electric kettle to boil water but using the hob was no problem.  Lastly  The view! Simply stunning  photos don’t do it justice. We spent a lot of time enjoying the outside space day and night. There is a lot of seating available. My father enjoyed the secluded swing seat under the Olive tree as some respite from the rest of the family!  A great stay  would recommend and return. Show more
16991160,Sebastien Stephanie August 2018 Very nice and peaceful area  with amazing view  ideal to disconnect with the world. Susi and Dominique are very nice and always helpful to make your stay perfect. We enjoyed this wonderful place.
16991160,Ulrich August 2018 Korfu with Premium View and high grade of Hospitality  We have enjoyed the 2 weeks first holiday at Korfu as a guest of Susi and Dominique. The house is designed in a modern style by a dutch architect and fully equipped with everything we needed for our 4 head family. Susi and Dominique had a lot of ideas for secret beaches and restaurants for us. Accomodation is highly recommended. We will come back. Thanks to Susi and Dominique
16991160,Jerome May 2018 This is such a wonderful place. The views are extraordinary - unlike anything else I've seen. It's so calm and restful and I can't think of a more incredibly situated swimming pool. The house is super stylish and thoughtfully designed. But above all Susi and Dominique were incredible hosts. They went out of their way to make us and our one year old daughter welcome (including getting a paddling pool for the little one). They had great recommendations and were always on hand if we needed anything. I would recommend this place to anyone in an instant! Response from Susi May 2018 Thanks Lucy and Jérôme. It was a great pleasure getting to know you and you will be welcome at any time. Translated  Show original
16991160,Jenny July 2017 This is a FANTASTIC house & a real gem - even nicer live than on the fantastic pictures! Great standard in both kitchen  bedroom and bathroom - high quality through out.

We'd love to come back!
16991160,Jack June 2017 Our stay was incredible! Only two nights long but Susi and her husband did absolutely everything to ensure our time there was precious. The house boasts unbelievable views and exceeded our expectations having looked at the photos! Thanks so much - we will DEFINITELY be back!

16991160,Matthias September 2022 Susi and Dominique are fantastic hosts  from the welcome with wine  snacks and tips to the great dinner on the last day.

16991160,Marine August 2022 We loved our stay! The house and the view are superb. Susi and Dominique gave us a warm welcome and gave us very good advice/help throughout our stay (booking a rental car  supermarkets  restaurants  activities  landscapes not to be missed). They were also very attentive with our daughters by giving us all the necessary childcare equipment. Recommended! Translated from French  Show original
16991160,Morgane July 2022 A little piece of heaven on earth … Hosts like us have never had. Susi and Dominique take their role as very passionate advice and want us to discover the authentic and less touristy side of the island! A tastefully decorated house  very well equipped (including the kitchen) and turned towards the outside with several dining and relaxation areas at our disposal. The showstopper is undoubtedly the infinity pool from which you can see beautiful sunsets! We absolutely recommend:) Translated from French  Show original

16991160,Julia September 2021 Susi made our first holiday perfect as a small family. Their hospitality is exceptional and more than lives up to their Superhost status.  The very stylish villa is located on the slope and therefore probably has the best view of Corfu. The interior design is very tasteful  the kitchen is well equipped and Susi made sure that our four-month-old baby also has a comfortable stay (crib  baby pool  high chair  etc.).  You definitely need a rental car to reach Susi's villa. She will be sure to point out NOT to use Google Maps in the region  which is very followable from her own experience! Follow Susi's advice to reach the village of Giannades via its suggested route. Google maps led us to a road turn that was too narrow to pass as well as very difficult to leave backwards.  We had a wonderful time and wish we could have stayed much longer. A real gem on Airbnb! Show more Translated from German  Show original

16991160,François August 2021 Beautiful home with an idyllic setting  far from everything. The hosts are very welcoming and offer good advice. The pool with sea view is splendid. An opportunity not to be missed!  Small downside : be careful of the wasps  they are everywhere and very many.  Little extra : There are very cute little cats all around the house and the hosts generously offer fruits and vegetables from their organic garden.  It is imperative that you rent a car to get to this house and  more generally  drive on Corfu. Susi has good contact for that. Translated from French  Show original
16991160,Tilman July 2021 We couldn't have had a better start to our trip to Greece. Great house  great secluded location  great pool  spectacular views and romantic sunsets. Susi and Dominique were of course the best. 5 out of 5 stars. We will be back. Translated from German  Show original
16991160,Auke & Ingrid June 2021 Susi is a wonderful and inspiring host. She and her particularly convenient and nice husband took care of the house and location excellently. We were welcomed and we closed with a very cozy drink with delicious snacks. Susi is a big lover of flora and fauna and knows the area well. Susi and her husband's advice are very useful if you want to make visits or eat somewhere. In short  the hostess and host are very helpful  friendly and have knowledge of the island.

569304796810423392,Zixuan September 2022 We had a great stay here. The villa is small but you have everything you need. The view over the mountain and sea is amazing! Swimming pool also very clean. In walking distance  you could reach the beach and harbor  where there are lovely restaurants. The host is also very very nice. Highly recommended!
569304796810423392,Jenny September 2022 we had a lovely week enjoying local walks  food and drink.
569304796810423392,Martin July 2022 Great villa  comfy and excellent pool and outdoor area. It’s up quite a steep hill but the surrounding beaches and area are well worth the hike!
569304796810423392,Isabel June 2022 A perfect stay! The villa is just as pictured and in a lovely quiet area. We really enjoyed our stay.
569304796810423392,Amanda May 2022 My boyfriend and I stayed at Villa Folitsa for one week and absolutely loved it. The villa has everything you need to cook (or bbq)  a hair dryer and even a washing machine. We spent a lot of time on the beautiful private terrace and in the pool. From the villa you can walk to two beaches and several tavernas. George was a great host  the communication was easy and he gave us many nice tips for the island. We would always come back to stay at the villa and can really recommend it for couples.
569304796810423392,Maddie May 2022 The villa was perfect for my partner and I. We loved using the pool and the location is great. Definitely need a car but Kassiopi is only a 5 minute Drive with everything you need. We were also able to walk 10 minutes to a small shop to get essentials. George was amazing  he replied to my messages promptly and sent us all the perfect places to visit while we were there. The villa is gorgeous and it was very clean  we absolutely loved our stay. We have left feeling very relaxed and recharged!
569304796810423392,Yulia May 2022 Quiet and resteful authentic house with an amazing view on Albania! Close to a port with a few bars/tavernas - truly a gem. I advise you get a small car to get around the island :)
569304796810423392,Corentin April 2022 A perfect stay. Translated from French  Show original
569304796810423392,Kevin April 2022 George is a very attentive host! On a trip with our 1-year-old  he made sure we lacked nothing (folding crib  high chair  etc.). The typical house we were in was beautiful with the pool which is a real plus (I imagine especially in summer  because at the end of April it was a little cool).  The location requires renting a vehicle as it is nestled on the heights of Agnitsini. The road to get there is a little jarring when you're not too used to going on this kind of road  but after a few days you get used to it.  The location is perfect for bouncing back on the various points of interest in the north of the island (very nice corners were recommended to us by George).  Go there without so much as a second thought  it's peaceful  it's typical  it's beautiful  the view from the terrace is great. And if you have any questions  George can advise you as best he can.  Thank you again for this stay. Show more Translated from French  Show original
49543795,John August 2022 Johnny's place exceeded our expectations. It was wonderfully well kept  stocked with everything we needed  and located in a beautiful spot with amazing views of the Ionian sea. The location was in an ideal spot on the island as well - convenient to the Old Town and many beaches and sites in Corfu. Note that Yaliskari is an amazing beach w/ an incredible taverna just below (a couple km) from Villa Nefeli.  The layout was perfect for our group of 10. We had plenty of space for everyone to spread out. Accommodations were comfortable  well appointed  and as described/shown. There were numerous beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces for everyone to gather. We especially enjoyed the infinity pool and many lounge areas around it. The large covered porch was an ideal spot for coffee drinks and meals as well.  Best of all was Johnny's communication. He was always quick to respond and communicated clearly. He met us at the house upon arrival and gave us an excellent tour and provided all info we needed for our stay. During the planning phase of our trip  he assisted us with wonderful recommendations & arrangements including a private yacht to Paxos & Antipaxi and a private chef at the Villa one evening. Johnny definitely helped make our vacation easy  special and one to remember. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Corfu!  A few other activities we greatly enjoyed in Corfu -- The Governors Olive Oil Tour  Aqualand  & Angelokastro. All were ideal for families. Show more
49543795,Ellen July 2022 Absolutely gorgeus view  lovely pool and very spacious villa. We had the best time with our 4 kids. Johnny was so helpful with check in and everything else. Hope to come back someday.
49543795,Vidhaata June 2022 Johnny was an amazing host- he really went out of his way to help. Our flight was delayed so we didn’t arrive until the early hours of the morning so Johnny arranged a private minibus for us. He also went shopping for us so that we had food for when we arrived. The villa was stunning. The views were breathtaking (even better than the pictures)! An amazing holiday was had by the whole family. Johnny also arranged a boat trip for us around Paxos and Antipaxos- which was also amazing!
49543795,Sarah May 2022 Beautiful secluded villa with absolutely stunning view  amazing pool and backyard  spotless clean  gorgeous decor and everything you might need. I cant say enough about this place and would give it 10 stars if possible. Our host Johnny was great  provided water and wine and even helped park the car since my dad struggled with a manual car. We are all sad to leave and plan to go back in September.
49543795,Imogen May 2022 Where to begin! We were a group of 9  travelling from the UK for my sisters hen do. The stay at this unbelievable villa was absolutely prefect. To begin with  the communication from Johnny from start to finish was incredible. He helped us with everything. He helped with suggestions  travel  transfers and was always available by phone. He also arranged a car hire for us to make our stay a bit easier  very last minute. The villa’s pictures do not do it justice - we couldn’t believe the view  it’s utterly breathtaking. The villa itself had everything we needed  from cups / plates /cutlery to fully stocked kitchen. It had several seating areas on various levels of the villa  and a second private pool house with more beds. On one of the days we walked to the beach and did some exploring then we found a bar. This was a very steep walk however  but lovely. We even managed to hire a local saxophone player for our last night  who played against the sunset at the top of the villa. From start to finish  we were absolutely delighted with our stay. This hen do was perfect and is now the most incredible lasting memory. The only thing I would say is  it’s up a very rocky / steep and uneven road - our minibus transfer couldn’t make it up the road and we had to walk. We explained this to Johnny who immediately came to get us and offered to arrange transfers that could drive up the track. So  having transport is absolutely crucial for this villa - I would suggest 2 cars for a bigger group. But if you are thinking about booking  look no further - DO IT! A big thank you to Johnny and the villa - what a break! Love  from the hen do girls x Show more
49543795,Jean-Philippe June 2022 The house is simply beautiful  the views amazing. Everything is there to feel super good  the house is very well equipped and functional. The location is 25 minutes from Corfu  30 minutes from Paleokastrista  everything is very well done by car. Johnny is always available to help or give advice.

32511348,Kitty October 2022 Wow - what a beautiful location with stunning views. Corinne's place was the perfect spot to explore all the corners of the island. She was a great host  making us feel really welcome and offering helpful tips. We will certainly be back.
32511348,Keith October 2022 A phenomenal  absolutely gorgeous cottage with a super-hospitable host. A very romantic spot for our honeymoon.  Corinne was such as wonderful host  and helped us with recommendations on where to shop  and even assisted in preparing my luggage for shipment.
32511348,Monika October 2022 Corinne is very friendly and inviting person. She was very helpful and responded quickly to our requests. Her new dog is a bandle of joy also very friendly. Willa is beautiful and clean  bed very comfortable. Willa is located high in the mountains with amazing views. The only thing that was a bit misleading from the advert was that we didn't expect host to live on site and swimming pool not private but on host property garden. To get in and out of the Willa you need to pass host property. Perfect escape for young or retired couple. Response from Corinne October 2022 Dear Monika  I am happy that you and your family appreciated the confortable cottage and the beauty of its site. I am just surprised that you pointed out a lack of precision from me about the pool  as it is precisely described on the Airbnb site regarding the equipments. I must say I am a bit disappointed with your unjustified assessment... Show more
32511348,Jill October 2022 Stunning location. Accommodation is impeccably designed and furnished. Corrine is a really welcoming host. Its an absolute tonic away from everyday life. We would love to come back again.
32511348,Jack June 2022 We absolutely loved staying at villa eden. Everything about it was perfect. The view was breathtaking  one of the best on the island. The garden was beautifully kept  full of beautiful trees  flowers and butterflies! The villa was impeccably decorated  super comfy big bed and huge pillows! It had everything we needed. The perfect place to unwind and relax.
32511348,Matthew June 2022 Wonderful stay! All the photos actually don’t do the place justice. You have a wonderful view of the sea  great location close to numerous restaurants and beaches  and it’s super well hidden so you feel like you are in a world of your own.
32511348,Margaret May 2022 We absolutely loved our stay at Corinne's place. It was magical and such a nice oasis! We were greeted with wine  chocolates  and flowers around the studio to celebrate our honeymoon. Corinne was very accommodating and her place has everything you could want or need - as well as an amazing view! Highly recommend staying here!
32511348,Anna May 2022 It was a beautiful place!
32511348,Cody May 2022 Great place to stay. A little out of the way but that is a good thing on Corfu. It is a very quiet property. The Airbnb itself was fantastic and a great value for what it is.
32511348,Andreas May 2022 Let me start by saying this : we travel quite a lot for many years and always prefer AIRBNB vs hotel. So we have seen quite some places - but Corinne’s Guesthouse is anything but. It is nothing less than „a corner of paradise „! The stunning view over Ypsos   the sea   Albania and all the way to Korfu City has been absolutely breath taking. You wake up with a sunset above the sea and have sun all day long. The apartment is beautiful designed with lots of love for detail in every corner. It is very well equipped with everything you need for cooking and relaxing. Corinne also welcomed us any time using the pool. She also surprised us with flowers in the apartment   some gifts and a wine. We could not recommend this more and to everyone who is reading this : don’t hesitated a second to book it! You will not regret it   that’s for sure.  Corinna - thank you again so much for the warm hospitality and for hosting us for the 4 nights. We will definitely come back :) Show more
32511348,Rochelle April 2022 Highly recommend staying here! Corinne was a great host and her view was incredible. We especially loved the company of her dog Lilou  who enthusiastically greeted us anytime we were around. Corfu itself was a breath of fresh air and I recommend visiting if you’re deciding between places.
32511348,Daniel October 2021 This is a lovely little place with fabulous views over the island. It’s cosy  clean  private and is situated in a pretty garden amongst Mediterranean forest. It’s the kind of place you’ll get to know your partner really well.
32511348,Tilly October 2021 Honestly our whole stay at the villa as just magical. Such a beautiful setting and just out of the way enough that you feel at one with nature but also close enough to restaurants etc so that you’re not totally isolated.  Corinne was an amazing host and so super thoughtful! Everything about the villa is so well thought out and to such a high standard. Would recommend staying here to absolutely everyone! 😘
32511348,Jill October 2021 I can't rate this cottage or the host high enough and is one of the best AirBnbs I've ever stayed in. Corinne was spot on with her restaurant suggestions  help with figuring out transportation and all the little touches make this a five star experience. Not to mention the stunning views with our morning sunrise coffees and night time starlit glass of wine. I would love to return again.
32511348,Doug October 2021 AMAZING VIEWS  wonderful clean  beautiful and comfortable cottage. Words and pictures do not do this place justice! It’s probably the best spot on the island! Host was super helpful  and provided good restaurant recommendations nearby.
32511348,Luke September 2021 A really beautiful place to stay. The views are stunning and the apartment itself is really comfortable and well equipped. Corinne was very welcoming and helpful  providing a cot for our 5-month old baby (who also enjoyed bobbing around in the pool!).
32511348,Michael June 2021 Amazing little cottage in a beautiful surrounding - definitely a 5-star accommodation with a super helpful and friendly host
32511348,Harvey June 2021 Stunning location. Tucked away with the use of a lovely pool. Amazing views. Very comfortable bed. Highly recommended.
32511348,"Daniel June 2021 Wow! What a beautiful location. The pictures shown don't promisse too much. It's even more beautiful. Corinne is one of the nicest hosts we've experienced. She was helpful in organizing our trip with tips and managing activities. Even with the ""Covid-Situation"" it was no problem to fly from Germany to Corfu. We felt safe throughout. And Corinne gave us all the information like testlab in Corfu  etc. We'll be back!"
32511348,"Felipe May 2021 We absolutely loved this charming cottage nestled in the hills and offering a stunning view of the sea below. The cottage is tastefully decorated and built with modern amenities and good use of space. It's a perfect space for a romantic vacation in a serene setting. Corinne was a gracious and welcoming hostess and was always attentive to our needs throughout our stay. The added bonus was having access to the grounds of the larger house including a pool and an idyllic  comfy hammock. Pure bliss and relaxation. If you like dogs  Corinne's ""Lilou"" is an absolute treasure - a wonderfully gentle soul. She is sometimes seen relaxing on the premises and always happy to play if you want. She won't bother you at all  if you aren't a dog person though - so not to worry. Would certainly recommend this cottage and would be glad to return in the future!"
32511348,Gabriela September 2020 Corinne’s place is truly a piece of paradise. The views are amazing  the decoration is impecable and the bed is so comfortable! The house has everything you need for a short or long stay  and every amenity is new and of good quality. Corinne is also a great host  easy to communicate and accomodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Corfu and would stay there again if we ever go back!

Every little detail thought of and supplied everything we needed and more. The setting is so beautifully peaceful. Would 100% stay again if coming back to Corfu. Definitely recommend having a car here. Location is also great for exploring the island. Thanks again!
32511348,Katie Sol October 2019 Pictures can't truly capture the beauty and tranquility of this place. Tucked on a mountainside  the stone cottage had stunning views. The cottage itself was obviously well planned and the decor lovely. Bed very comfortable and had great sunrise views. Private from main house but close enough to pool and hostess. Favorite of all our stays in our 3 weeks in Greece!
32511348,Flo October 2019 We were staying at Corinnes´wonderful place for a few days in the north-east of corfu having a great time there. We were cordially received  the communication  check-in/-out was super easy and uncomplicated. Corinne was a very nice host taking fully care of us with help and recommodations. The small stone-house was cleaned-up well and neat with a lot of detail-love and everything you need. We really enjoyed our stay there and can highly reccomend Corinnes´place.
32511348,Hannah October 2019 Corinne‘s ‚Un coin de Paradis‘ is absolutly gorgeous! Everything is very (!!) clean and even more beautiful and stunning than the pictures can show! (Especially the view by day and night as well as the garden and the pool) The guest house is very stylish and well equipped. Unfortunately we only had 3 nights - but if we come back to Korfu we would definitly try to come back to Corinne. Response from Corinne October 2019 Thank you Hannah  always welcome!! Translated  Show original
32511348,Edward September 2019 A wonderful little cottage sitting alongside the main villa (where the owner lives) with it’s own private garden. NB the pool and hammock in photos are with the main villa but you are able to use the pool. This was our first trip with a baby (5 months) and Corinne was very accommodating in sorting a cot bed. Just make sure you are accustomed with 1st gear in the trip up to the property (more than worth it for the views)! Cottage well appointed throughout.
32511348,Mick September 2019 An amazing tranquil retreat in the hills with spectacular views of the sea. The cottage exceeded our expectations and the attention to detail to the interior was outstanding. The infinity pool was a welcome addition on the hot days. A great base to explore the island.
32511348,Lennard September 2019 I highly reccomand staying in Corinne's cottage. She is such an amazing host  willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is just stunning and simply perfect in every detail. Everything was clean  well decorated and the location has the most amazing 180 degree view over Corfu city and the coast. All in all the cottage exceeded our expectations. Photos can't tell the beauty of this place.
32511348,Celia June 2019 Thank you for a sensational stay in your little cottage. Corrine has put huge time and effort into creating an unrivalled get away in Corfu. You would struggle to find a better base for a couple looking to explore the island.
32511348,Cameron June 2019 This haven is even more beautiful than the pictures! We didn't want for anything and the interior was beautifully contemporary  keeping buckets of charm. Our host was helpful and lovely and if we do ever come back to corfu  there's no question we would come back!
32511348,Elisa June 2019 Wonderful cottage and good situated in Korfu. We enjoyed every moment there  the view is gorgeous and enjoying it while taking a bath in the pool makes it even better. Corinne was really friendly and helped us with all of our questions  by the way she speaks french  english and german which is also a bonus. I really can fully recommend it! Our trip was worth every single penny of it.
32511348,Eden June 2019 Corrine’s cottage is exactly like the pictures show! It’s very clean and very quiet and peaceful. The view is something you will never see again! I would recommend this cottage and Corinne’s kind and helpful hospitality to everyone!
32511348,Christopher May 2019 This really is a little corner of Paradise!!! A brand-new  comfortable and very tastefully decorated little cottage with the most stunning view ever! It has all the amenities you need when you want to get away from the noises of life and just unwind for a bit. Corinne is very friendly and helpful and she wants her guests to be as comfortable as possible. You can also tell she developed the whole property (including the beautiful garden) with so much love and sense of style! We absolutely loved our stay there and we will definitely come back on our next trip to Corfu.
32511348,Alessandro May 2019 An outstanding piece of Paradise!!! It is a brand new cottage with a breathtaking view! The place is immaculate  all new and planned to be perfect.

The best part is the great view you have from your own garden. We highly recommend the place and would book it again if we are in Corfu again. As the view suggests  the location is a bit remote  which makes the accommodation wonderfully quiet. It is recommended to have a rental car so you can explore the island from here. Corinne is a super host and was always available to us. :) Translated from German  Show original
32511348,Nele September 2020 Dream house! Chic  new  down to the last detail just beautiful. 🤩 We could use the great pool and hammock at any time.

Everything is exactly as in the pictures and in reality even 100 times more beautiful - even if that is hardly possible:) The cottage is new and very clean  has the perfect size for two people and is lovingly  stylish and furnished to a very high standard. If you are looking for peace and quiet and dream of enjoying the view (down into the valley and over to Albania)  you have definitely landed here in the right place. We could use the pool at any time - another highlight! The cottage is a good starting point for many explorations around the island and the nearest beaches and restaurants can also be reached quickly by car. Corinne and her husband are wonderful hosts and we felt immediately welcome. If we come to Corfu again then definitely come back to this wonderful  unique place! Translated from German  Show original
32511348,Patrick June 2019 Great hosts  an exceptional place to stay. Corinne is a warm and great host who always cares about the well-being of her guests.

The nearest beaches are about 5-10 minutes away by car. If you are looking for peace  quality and a great view  this is the place to be. Hospitality is paramount with Corinne  on the last evening we were even invited to barbecue. Simply excellent! Translated from German  Show original

Everything is easy to explore with a car or scooter  and supermarkets and restaurants can be reached in a few minutes. Translated from German  Show original
49088870,Hanna October 2022 This house is the perfect location to explore Corfu. We were within a 20 minute drive of many great beaches and restaurants. The host left us a bottle of wine and snacks upon checkin which was very sweet. I would highly recommend this Airbnb for your stay on Corfu!
49088870,Dutu September 2022 The house was excellent  photos were accurate  ammenities inside were as promised  very clean and modern  if you have a car rented then it is perfect.
49088870,Bozhidara September 2022 The house is amazing just like in the pictures  the communication with Dimitris was very easy and smooth. If you have a car the location is great - close to many beaches and to the old town of Corfu  the average travel time to the beaches and town was 20 min. Dimitris gave us a list of recommendations for beaches  restaurants and places to visit which was very helpful for us and I recommend following it. All in all we are completely satisfied!
49088870,Oded August 2022 Great place   great central location..highly recommended
49088870,Øystein August 2022 We had a great time at Iliopetra house. The house and interior was fantastic. Great location central on the island with good access to beach and Corfu town (you need a car). Restaurant recommendations from Dimitris was super 👌
49088870,Vicky July 2022 We have just returned from a week stay in illiopetra. The property is stunning and exactly like the pictures. The pool area is shared with a smaller joining property which was no problem  we made friends with the 2 lots of guests who were there. Lovely little private patio area to eat at on an evening. Everything needed to cook and eat in and was a nice surprise to find nice cold beer and wine in the fridge after a late flight. Communication with Dimitris was always quick and gave us all the information we needed. I would definitely recommend hiring a car as there is nowhere near enough to walk to from the villa. We used vidos car hire which were a lot cheaper than many we looked at. We also found a nice little restaurant/grill nearby called Paprika  food was really nice and cost under 100€ for 6 people. Would definitely recommend this place.
49088870,Marie-Theres July 2022 Its a beautiful house in the near of Korfu. The house was clean and Dimitris put some Snacks for us in the house before we arrive. Everybody of us were really happy with everything in the accommodation. Three Days somebody was coming to look at the Pool  but the persons are all kindly. We were a group of eight people and we would always come back.
49088870,Rasmus July 2022 Very lovely place. Dimitris was such a good host  when why had any troubles. Would recommend to rent a car.
49088870,Matthew June 2022 We had a fantastic stay here. We reviewed different properties in Corfu before deciding on this one and I'm so glad we did. It looks as nice in person as it does in the photos. There is a lovely pool  which is shared with the residents of the house next door (we made friends with the couple who stayed during our time there) and sometimes we had it to ourselves. It has fantastic air con throughout in all the rooms  which is great  particularly on a hot day. Dimitris kindly left us some snacks  fruit  wine and water when we arrived  especially helpful as you can't use tap water to drink from in Corfu. Initially it was difficult getting through to the host to book  but oncer we did  Dimitris was great and was able to answer all our queries. He also very kindly allowed me a call before we arrived and was able to provide us with tips of where to go  what to see and when we arrived very late  he messaged to check on how we were doing and that we had arrived safely and had all we needed. He had also sent photos/map details to help us find the property and allowed us a late check out  which we were grateful for. It's a great place to relax  the pool is fantastic  a great temperature in the heat and which is regularly cleaned. We loved using the espresso machine too while we were there and there was a range of really nice plates and cups to use for the days we stayed in and cooked. It's a great size  good to have a washing machine and although there was only 4 of us  more could have come  as it's a big enough space. Dimitris and the family have also added a table  chairs and umbrella which we could use outside every morning and evening. A nice touch was a family member stopping by in the week to check we had all the supplies we needed. It's 15-20 minutes from Corfu town  5 minutes from a nice water park which we visited and 10 minutes from a local bakery and other shops are nearby. We were glad we stayed in the middle of Corfu  rather than south or north  as it gave us the option to get to wherever we wanted to go. I'd recommend a stay here - it's great value too! Show more
49088870,Luaai March 2022 Many thanks to Dimitris for making our stay as pleasant as possible. The actual villa is exactly as was shown in the pictures  no regrets about picking this place whatsoever. Would highly recommend. Just a tip to anyone who wants to rent this villa  either have a car in handy or have a taxi driver contact as there are none in the nearby area.
49088870,Nunzio August 2021 The house is very beautiful  better than in the photo. The host is always available and polite. I suggest everyone who wants to visit Corfu to take Liopetra House.
49088870,Dragos August 2021 A charming piece of architecture. Warm and welcoming  yet spacious and modern. The architect made her point here. The pool  the details of the courtyard  the little touches of design within the olive snags and stone carvs  the combination between classic and modern furniture...really felt excellent. The location is ideal for explorers  being located in centre and  therefore  able.to travel 10 to 25 min to all beaches in the central part of the island or points of interest (the old city of Corfu  Achilion etc)
49088870,Melina August 2021 Our stay was perfect! The host is accommodating and the house is exactly like the pictures! Dinitris left us some breakfast  local products and wine for our arrival.This was beyond every expectation. If you rent a car this is is a great location to stay near Corfu center. Thank you for everything!
49088870,Leon July 2021 Dimitris is super welcoming and did everything to make our stay outstanding. We really enjoyed our stay at this fantastic place. Thanks! :)
49088870,Daniel July 2021 The house was as described in the pictures  and the place was clean and perfect when we arrived. Dimitris has been a perfect host and I definitely recommend staying at his place!
49088870,Luca September 2022 Beautiful house  very friendly host and available if you need it.

35185445,Tamara October 2022 Effie's place is fantastic! It's a great location in a charming mountain town; very clean  and wonderful views. Effie was great at communicating and welcomed us when we arrived  explaining how things worked in the house and answering any questions we had. An added bonus was the family's wonderful garden below the house. Absolutely gorgeous scenery!
35185445,Gabriela September 2022 We had a perfect stay at Effie’s. The flat was lovely and spacious  sparkling clean. Pentati is a lovely village with three restaurants (all delicious). We didn’t have a car but this didn’t matter  there is a sweet little harbour for swimming just a 10-20 minute walk from the flat. There is also a coastal path which leads to Agios Gordios (roughly 40 minutes). We also walked to Paramonas beach (50 mins). We would definitly come back!
35185445,Michael June 2022 We really enjoyed Effie’s Appartement. It was clean  well furnished with nice garden and a great view onto the sea and the beach. Effie is a great host. Communication with her was fast and easy. Everybody in the village is very friendly  especially Effie’s grandma supported us with lots of fruits from her garden.
35185445,Shahab June 2022 It's a lovely Town full of lovely Town folks  It's a lovely Apartment  It's a lovely View   I couldn't wish for more for my first Stay in Corfu. Everything was as described and Effie did a really good Job of communicating and checking on me.  I just can recommend her  her apartment and the the lovely village.  (also visit Angela's tavern  you gonna love it).  BUT 1 thing i have to warn everyone that books the place. Be a confident driver. the streets aren't dangerous but you need a lot of confidence to drive time. From time they feel dangerous!!
35185445,Alexander May 2022 We had a very nice vacation at Effis house  we can absolutely recommend it.
35185445,Carolyn April 2022 Great “off the beaten path” location! Beautiful view of the sea and the mountains. Effie was great at communication and helping with any need we had.
35185445,Florian April 2022 Effie's place is a little cosy paradise. It is tidy and clean. You have everything you need and in case there is anything that you are missing  Effie is always there for you. She is always helping and super friendly. The fire place is also a great freature that we came to enjoy as the weather was unusually cold for this time of year. The view from the terace is amazing and the beach is just a short drive away. We will definitively return!
35185445,Olga March 2022 Very nice cottage in beautiful local village! Well equipped (air conditioners  fireplace  hot water  wifi).  Great view from the terrace. There are two local tavernas in the village and mini market.  The road to the village is a little bit extremal  but if you are a confident driver it will be ok :)  Effie is a very friendly host  she helped us with everything we needed! Effie  thanks a lot!  Strongly recommend this place!
35185445,Giedrė November 2021 The calm stay in a local village with a beautiful small old town.
35185445,William October 2021 An amazing place to stay in the beautiful village of Pentati. Sitting out on the terrace and enjoying the sunset/stars was beautiful. I would highly recommend staying here.
35185445,Cédric October 2021 Nice place with a awesome view. Well equipped and clean  we loved this place and the village.
35185445,Maria September 2021 It is a shame I cannot rate this stay with more than 5 stars! Effie is a great host and amazing at communication - she helped with everything we asked. The house is in a lovely location with a breathtaking view  very clean and comfortable. I would definitely 100% recommend Effie and her apartment :)
35185445,Anneke September 2021 Effies apartment was the perfect place for a relaxing vacation on Korfu. It's fully equipped  nicely decorated and very clean. It's located in a small quiet village on a hill  so you have a beautiful view on the bay. There are two authentic greek restaurants just around the corner and with a rental car you can reach all areas of the island. Effie is a very kind and friendly host who was always there for us in case we needed something.
35185445,Lena September 2021 We really enjoyed the stay at Effie‘s apartment. Communication and check-in went well. To get to the village the path is quite steep and has many curves but the view from the flat is worth it! We even got some fresh fruit from the garden which was lovely :)
35185445,Ángel September 2021 The village and this apartment were for me the nicest place in all the island. Authentic greek life  calm and with an a amazing orchard and views.
35185445,Sebastian July 2021 Great apartment! Clean Airbnb with an amazing view. Effie was very helpful and quick to respond.
35185445,"Marta June 2021 The Effie's house is cosy place  located in beautiful traditional village Pentati. From the yard there is stunning view on the mountainous coast. The village isn't ""touristic"" spot at all. Old buildings  monastery  grocery with bread and fresh products  traditional taverns and hidden path to the empty beach. The house is clean and have everything what is described and even more. We were surprised with fresh fruit picked up from her garden. Effie is wonderful host. We have great communication during all stay and she helped us everytime we need. We hope to see Effie and Pentati village again!"
35185445,Tony October 2020 Effie’s house is a very nice place  breathetaking view to the open sea (view to the Agios Gordios Beach) and beautiful surroundings in a nice little village. We had wonderful breakfasts in the garden and enjoyed the hammock. The house is very cosy and comfortable  also with German and international TV. Everything was clean and perfect. There was also a very good baby bed for our three-year-old. Effie has a good sense for design. Thank you so much  Effie!
35185445,Lars October 2020 Everything fine

35185445,Andrea August 2019 Pentati is a magical piace to stay and Efi apartment was perfect for us: a beautiful view  an incredible harbour and all the traditions of Greece! Thanks. We hope to return soon.
35185445,Sini August 2019 Our stay in Efis apartment was amazing. Garden is just perfect and view was even better than we expected! We got all the help we needed and communication was easy. Pentati is quiet little village  just what we were looking for. There is little beach in walking distance from the house and whit a car you find many nice beaches close by. We tried one restaurant in Pentati called Angela's tavern  food and service was great  highly recommended. On departure day we were surprised whit fresh figs from our garden  efharisto! :)
35185445,Maksym July 2019 The house has been recently refurbished and now everything iside is OK including kitchen facilites  bathroom  badroms. It has 2 spacious apartments on the ground and 1st floor  small garden and nice view to sea and mountains. Located at the upper part of the village in a quite place.  Blocks of neighbor buildings are not completely finished  so you can observe some constructing equpment and a bit mess with matherials.  Efi is great and responsible host. She helped us with little things and presented a bottle of home wine. Actuallty two bottles.
35185445,"Michael October 2022 Communication with Effi went perfectly  as did check-in and check-out with personal key handover and instruction. The apartment was clean  spacious  as described and equipped with all important things. 2 bottles of water  some juice  lemonade and 1 bottle of wine were chilled ready for arrival. The coastal view is breathtakingly beautiful. The place offers 3 good local tavernas within walking distance with the best Greek home cooking and warm service as well as a small shop where you can buy everything you need (basics without too much selection  but sufficient). The ""swimming bay"" can be reached on foot in about 15 minutes  by car in about 3 minutes via a small  very steep road. Sand IS only available here IN the water. But always sufficient for an evening refreshment. Otherwise  the nearby beautiful sandy beach of Agios Gordios is ideal for swimming. Translated from German  Show original"
35185445,Madlen August 2022 This unique view of the ocean and the outdoor shower in the middle of the flower sea were unique! Effie is super nice and is available for all questions and excursion tips. Thank you Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Stefan August 2022 Effie was very available and kind. We had fruits and vegetables from the vegetable garden. The house was clean and the kitchen very well equipped. We'll be happy to go back to Pentati. ☺️ Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Miguel August 2022 Fantastic Translated from Italian  Show original
35185445,Tanja August 2022 Effie is one of the nicest hosts we've ever had. She was always available and responded and helped to all of our concerns within a few minutes. Whether taxi  supermarket  etc.  she took care of everything. The apartment looks like the pictures and the terrace is really amazing! Although the small village of Pentati is located outside  it is a super beautiful old village  in which we felt village known within 3 days and welcomed into the village family. There are two super nice tavernas where you can still look into the kitchen and choose your food without a menu. However  we would not recommend this stay without our own rental car. If we travel to Corfu again  we will definitely come back. Thanks for all the Effie! :) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Sophie July 2022 Very nice house with beautiful views and garden. The house is spacious and well-equipped. We really enjoyed the village of Pentati close to the beaches. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Andrea June 2022 Effie is a perfect host  she was there when needed but never unnecessary. She was also available by phone at night! Her house  with a garden anda view  is beautiful. But above the apartment  there's an apartment for rent so we didn't have the whole house to ourselves. The soundproofing of the house is very weak  and the people who live above us have heard every step of the way. Kitchen equipment is a bit weak  with little cooking pots but it's a creative way to get through it! 😉 The setting is perfect  the small village is really quiet  but there's a restaurant andconvenience store. It's the perfect place to hang out. Translated from Hungarian  Show original
35185445,Marion May 2022 the view is sublime  quiet place. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Thomas April 2022 Effi is a very good host. She was always available to help with any questions or problems. We enjoyed staying in the delightful village. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Juliane October 2021 We had a great time in Effie's apartment and in the small mountain village a bit away from tourists. Nevertheless  the beautiful beaches and hotspots of Corfu are easily accessible.  The communication with Effie was very easy and hassle-free. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Stephan October 2021 Great place   great location Effie looked after  advises excellently and makes you feel the Greek hospitality. - and all this authentic and without a lot of fuss - I would book again at any time Translated from German  Show original
35185445,卡拉卡拉仙人 October 2021 Located on a hill in the west of the island  the village has a beautiful view of the bay at any time.The host and the people in the village are very welcoming and warm  and the experience is great. Translated from Chinese (Simplified)  Show original
35185445,Flore August 2021 Very nice house  very clean. Terrace with stunning sea views  quiet  in a very pleasant and authentic village. Effie gave us a warm welcome  and was very available to avoid any difficulties on several occasions (coming in the evening to call a doctor for us  looking for a package). Effie's grandmother is lovely too and gave us delicious figs from her garden every day. In short  a little paradise  a big thank you ! Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Jasmin August 2021 It was absolutely perfect. Top furnished apartment and very large feel-good ambiance. Amazing view :) Very clean. Effie welcomed us so warmly and was always there for us with questions. In Pentati itself there are 2 tavernas - highly recommended. The nearest village for shopping is in Argios Georgios - about 8 minutes by car or moped. Tip: Be sure to rent a car or moped:) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Marie July 2021 The accommodation enjoys magnificent views of the bay  it is spacious and the outside is a plus. A small downside however regarding the cleanliness of the floor (under beds and sofas) and the lack of kitchen equipment available  which I found a little limited. Nothing bad though. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Juliette July 2021 Very pleasant apartment with a private garden and magnificent views. Effie is very responsive and welcoming. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Jean Michel July 2021 Accommodation with magnificent views  very quiet. Effile welcomed us around midnight ...She is very attentive. It takes a gps to find the village ( especially for a night arrival like us!). The village has two restaurants including a really typical one..We enjoyed the surrounding countryside  a small road in olive groves with century-old trees. The accommodation is well-equipped. We had a pleasant time. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Hannah July 2021 A beautiful place with small tavernas and a small bay that we could walk to in 15 minutes. Fantastic. The garden below the apartment was a happiness. We were provided with delicacies from the garden! :) Translated from German  Show original

35185445,Robert June 2021 We had a very nice stay at Effie's house. The apartment is equipped with all important utensils and the hostess is very nice  friendly and helpful. The sitting area overlooking the sea is particularly noteworthy. There are some animals such as cats and dogs in the area who like to visit again and again. Very likeable! Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Roghieh October 2020 It was beautiful and we had a relaxing vacation at Effie's place. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Cecilia September 2020 It's been beautiful at Effie's. She is super nice and the apartment really nice! Very clean! The garden and the view of the sea are unforgettable. We got fresh vegetables and fruit directly from the garden every day. Definitely recommend! Next time! :) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Floriane September 2020 The house is clean and functional located in a quiet village  enough to spend a relaxing holiday. However  the house is in the mountains  a vehicle rental would be expected in order to make the most of the island. Effie is very kind and caring  she will do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Pierre September 2020 Very convenient accommodation in a beautiful setting Translated from French  Show original

35185445,Βασιλικη August 2020 Thoughtful and welcoming hosts!! Efi asked us how many times we were okay  or if we needed anything  and they were always willing to help or help us with something. The house is very clean and tidy and has a disinfectant and has a washer so you won't need a lot of clothes!! If you are lucky you will leave with fresh goodies from the garden completely fresh and delicious!!! We were gifted it by Efi's grandmother  a very kind lady!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
35185445,Manuela August 2020 We just got back from the Corfu holiday and had 2 great weeks at Effie's apartment. She is a great host  the apartment just remodeled her  new photos should come soon  the garden  the flowers  the view of the sea...just magical. Half an hour from the airport  it is recommended to rent a car to explore the beautiful island. Here  too  Effie is here to help. We were travelling with our 3 sons and had plenty of room. Walk to the beach in the morning (over the floor and over stone) ... wonderful 😊Effie's grandma spoiled us with delicacies from her own garden 😋  So if you are looking for relaxation and recreation  you will get 100% money in the small mountain village of Pentati away from tourism.   🍀☀️🐬We are very grateful to have found this enchanting place 💖 Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Magali July 2020 We were charmed by Effie's warm welcome who was available and always smiling  the very nice touches from her grandmother  the magnificent view of the terrace overlooking the sea  the cleanliness of the house  the modern amenities ( air conditioning  washing machine  kitchenette  shower ...)  the decoration   the comfort ... We loved our stay in Pentati  a typical village from which we were able to enjoy the beautiful and quiet beaches of the west coast of the island. Only 35 minutes from Corfu  I warmly recommend this property. We'll be happy to go back! Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Achim September 2019 Efi's apartment is a cozy place with family connections and a great view of the bay. We have always been spoiled with things from the garden by grandma. Highly recommended. Translated from German  Show original
22682902,Kate September 2022 A beautiful  spacious villa in a great location  convenient for Corfu town  beaches and the rest of the island. The pool is fabulous and really private and peaceful. The photos really don’t do the villa justice. Peter was a great host  with clear and helpful communications. There are a few local bars and tavernas well worth visiting.
22682902,Blair September 2022 We had a great stay at this villa while visiting Corfu for a week. The villa was way better than expected and Peter was so helpful in organising taxis  boat hire etc. His communication was excellent and he was able to offer late checkout for us due to a late evening flight. The villa had a nice pool  and a well-kitted-out kitchen and the bedrooms were a good size. We would love to stay here again  it was absolutely perfect! Thanks Peter
22682902,Owen July 2022 The villa was fantastic  much bigger than I expected! The location worked great for us  day trips to beaches (pelekas and paleokastritsa) and Corfu town within 15-30 mins drive and quite a few good places to eat within walking distance (Costas Taverna and Pizza Nostra). The hosts  two brothers  Costas and Peter made us feel at home and provided great local advice. The private pool was very welcome to shake off the current great wave!
22682902,Aileen July 2022 Villa Lydia is a beautiful villa  and we really loved are time there! The villa itself is much bigger than you would imagine from the pictures  and really is the perfect retreat. It is well located  just over 10 minutes drive into Corfu town  and there are 2 tavernas  a supermarket and pharmacy within a short walk. A car is needed to travel around easily. Aqua land is very close by and worth a trip if you are that way inclined! The pool area of the villa is really great  and it’s lovely to drift off to sleep on the sunbeds whilst listening to all of the wildlife around you. Peter and Kostas are superb hosts  and are always on hand if needed  but never intrusive in any way. We have no hesitation in highly recommending this villa and are already looking forward to our next visit!
22682902,David June 2022 Great villa  had everything you need. Hire car is needed  then you have fantastic beaches within 20 mins drive  waterworld is 20 mins walk. village taverna 5mins walk and they are lovely people. Burger bar  supermarket (from meat to nappies) and ice cream/cake/coffee shop (ice cream was delicious) only 10 mins walk. plenty of day trips and all within 30 mins drive  then back to the pool. Would definitely come again. Peter was fantastic  places to go or eat

Villa is better than photos without a doubt  pool fantastic and whilst location is remote  there are great tavernas around  a supermarket  aqualand and bus & taxi within walking.  We had a great week. Would recommend Costas Taverna a short walk from villa for a great authentic Greek dinner. Also the Ambelonas Vineyard is about 30 mins walk away and is well worth a visit - stunning food and great wine at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend staying here. 10/10
22682902,Annet July 2020 The villa is very beautiful and it's location is practical. It's a spacious villa (inside and outside) and a relaxing place to enjoy a vacation.

5263938,Marian July 2021 Grigori’s place is simply amazing! Everything is thought for you to spend the most relaxing and exciting vacation! We had a two room apartment which is big and the begging is very good quality. The rooms are at shadow and it doesn’t get hot inside during the day. The kitchen and bathroom are exactly what is needed ( although there are also some good restaurants on the beach : check Spyros  simply delicious). The best of all are the people : we met Grigoris and Eleni  his mom  the most wonderful and welcoming people. Thank you again for our amazing vacation!

5263938,Philipp August 2018 A super nice place  with a nice view over the sea  the beach in walking distance and a very friendly host.
5263938,Shami August 2018 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Maistro apartments. The apartment was very clean and well organised  and had everything needed for a comfortable home from home holiday. The air con was a blessing and made cooking in the evenings a relaxing pleasure. The location is great  only a 4 minute walk to Pelekas beach which easily caters for every age group. There is a choice of restaurants to eat in  water sports and inflatable activities for all ages  sunbeds and umbrellas available if you don’t have your own  and beautiful clear water which is fantastic for swimming  snorkelling and playing in. On the way back to the apartment there is a small well stocked supermarket for all your daily needs.  The apartment is a good base to explore other areas of the island. From the top of the hill there is a regular bus service to Corfu Town. From there you can take to bus to anywhere you like. Car hire is recommended as it does give you more flexibility.  The key selling point of Maistro apartments is the hospitality. Grigoris and his family looked after us incredibly well. Grigoris took us to a large supermarket on our first day so we could stock up with essential items. He gave us lifts to the top of the hill so we could catch the bus to Corfu Town  put us in touch with a car hire company  and organised a birthday cake for my son. He also gave us general tips and advice on the island. We can’t thank him enough for his kindness and generosity. Show more
5263938,Judith July 2015 Our stay with Grigoris was magnificent. He was extremely warm and generous  helping us get to his house  sharing his love for the island  opening up his exquisite apartment which had every thing you might need. The view of the sea  short walk to the sea  wonderful porch were lovely. We felt welcome   cared for  and very grateful for the hospitality of him and his family. Next time  we will stay much longer Many thanks.
5263938,Bernhard July 2019 The apartment is spacious and very clean. It is additionally cleaned in between and the bed linen  as well as the towels  are changed. The terrace has an amazing sea view.

Alexandros was super helpful: He sent us very detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment (pictures and everything)  he was always available to answer questions and he even gave us lots of recommendations on rental car companies and places to eat and visit! Definitely recommended!
26626389,Allen September 2022 Our stay at Alesandro's place in Kokkini was lovely......his top floor apartment there in the village was perfect for a quiet  view-filled stay off the beaten track a bit.....it was a little tough to find  but worth the looking.....we highly recommend his place for a stay on Corfu....Allen & Kathy  Boise  Idaho  USA

Alexandros was really responsive and helping with everything  the place was really tidy and clean  had everything you need in the bathroom  kitchen  bedroom. The view from the balcony is stunning and the environment is enjoyable. The place is quiet and a bit distant  so to have a car or other vehicle is necessary. In total  best recommendations!
26626389,Laura July 2022 We had a really nice week at Alexandros apartment in Kokkini  everything was just as we wished! Unfortunately we didn’t had the ability to meet Alexandros in person nevertheless check-in and check-out was super easy and Alexandros gave us the opportunity to text or call him whenever we need something! Also he gave us some useful information about car rental and transfer for which we were very grateful. All in all we can recommend a trip to wonderful Corfu and a stay at Alexandros nice apartment.
26626389,Erik July 2022 The one word we had for our stay at Alexandros place was Magical. Was located in a beautiful small village a short car journey to multiple beaches and more. About the apartment  11/10! The view from the terrace was beautiful and the apartment was the perfect size for two people. Alexandros was also an terrific host. Nothing to complain about  the only note is that a car is neccesary for getting the most out of this gem.
26626389,Maria July 2022 Good place  but it's a little bit hard if you have a lot of baggage  because of the stairs. I was there with car and it was perfect because two good beaches Glifada and Kontagialos is 7/8 kilometers . and beautiful Corfu old town is 12 kilometers. But without car it will be hard. There is good Tavernas in Pelekas  5 kilometers from Kokini. If you have car everything is Ok. Thank you Alexandros!
26626389,Craig June 2022 We stayed for a week at Alexandros' studio  the view is fantastic and the perfect place to sit and have a drink after a day at the beach/exploring Corfu.  We rented a car (I highly recommend a car for this location) and we had no issues parking in the square below the studio  the locals were very friendly.  There is a small shop at the bottom of the hill to buy bottled water and other supplies. A 5 minute drive to the beautiful beach at Pelekas.  Would recommend 100%
26626389,Austra June 2022 Everything was great - we enjoyed our stay. Easy check-in and view was spectacular! Bonus -> free parking near house.
26626389,Jeff May 2022 Alexandros' rooftop studio was perfect for our holiday on the beautiful island of Corfu. It is located in a small village  which we much prefer to the busier tourist areas. We had a car (essential) and went out every day but had somewhere peaceful to return to. The location is quite central and was perfect for seeing the island. Parking was never a problem  we got a space in the square every night and the car is visible from the apartment. You can get to the coast within 15 minutes. The larger resorts and Corfu town are about 25 minutes away. Make sure you visit The Kaiser's Observatory in the next town for an amazing view of the island followed by a drink on the beautiful terrace of the mountain-top hotel. One word of warning  the stairs to reach the apartment are a little tricky. Getting our medium sized case up was a bit awkward. I wouldn't take a large case. Once you are used to it  it's fine though. All-in-all we had an amazing time and look forward to returning soon. Thanks Alexandros.
26626389,Stella April 2022 This apartment has everything you need for a wonderful stay I Corfu. The apartment is really well equipped and clean and the view from the big terrace is amazing! It is well situated in a calm little village with beautiful surroundings and lots to explore. I did really nice hikes to the nearest beaches small villages. I would definitely recommend this place!
26626389,Karin October 2021 A lovely place at the highest point of a lovely  sleepy town. Very clean & comfortable. Enjoyed the sunrise on the terrace  hearing singing from the church nearby. Would come again for sure.
26626389,Nikolett September 2021 We spent a wonderful time at Alexandros's place  he was helpful and friendly  the view was delightful and of course the apartment was clean and so cozy. I can only recommend this place  if you're looking for a peaceful apartment where you can rest  but in the same time the great beaches are still available from there.
26626389,Alexander September 2021 Nice flat  which is not too far from Kerkyra  but away from mass tourism. Everything is very clean and the size is ideal for 2 people. The kitchen is well equipped and has an oven and a large fridge. The roof terrace is a dream and you sit very nicely under the pergola. The nearest beaches Glifada and Mirtiotissa can be reached quickly by car. Alexandros is a great and very nice host who responds quickly to any questions.
26626389,Ezgi September 2021 Alexandros place is just incredible! It looks exactly like in the pictures and it super clean. The location is perfect. You can reach anything without any problem and have a quite location at the same time. We spend amazing evenings on the terrace with a breathtaking view! I would recommend this accommodation to anyone!
26626389,Hugo August 2021 If you are seeking a quiet  secluded place  this studio is the place to be! The terrace  which is up in the trees  offers a panoramic view on the hills and the valley  having dinner there is truly wonderful - especially since there is a barbecue. The room and kitchen are neat and well equipped. There are beautiful beaches nearby and Corfu town is only 20min away by car. Alexandros and Kathrin were very welcoming and available  they're great hosts! I definitely recommend this apartment.
26626389,"Maximilian August 2021 Everything is exactly as described (and i mean it). The Appartement was clean and had everything you could need. The view from the Appartement is absolutely amazing  we loved watching the sunset and to eat outside.  Alexandros is a very helpful host. He gave us a lot of information and helpful tipps for our stay and he answers very fast. Definetly deserves to be called ""Super Host"".  Kokkini is beautiful and calm  the people there are very friendly. Especially with the view it is a nice place to spend quiet calm evenings. For us  way better than some Tourist Hotspot.  Kokkini has a Bus Station  5 minutes from the Appartement  bus transfer is alright. We had a rental car  but ended up not using it that much. Instead we used the bus. Driving on the Island was pretty difficult for me  since everything is narrow and steep and i am not used to driving shift. I'm used to drive on my hunting grounds in the German forrest with my Truck  but driving here ist something else  maybe consider using other forms of transportation  or maybe you're just better drivers 😅. Be aware  Google Maps sometimes gives you directions to the Appartement which are not streets and end. The safe way (space for 2 Cars)to drive up is at the Taverna.  We had a beautiful stay on Corfu and are very happy we chose to stay at Alexandros AirBnB. Show more"
26626389,Bri August 2021 My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay at Alexandros’ apartment. We did not know much about Corfu but I read that most of the sandy beaches are on the west coast which is why we were looking for a place on the west side of the island. That being said  Alexandos’ apartment in Kokkini could not have been more perfect! The first 3 days we did not rent a car but Alexandros was very helpful and sent over the green bus schedule to us. This allowed us to take the bus to and from Glyfada beach (which was also an amazing recommendation from his listing). The bus stop was only about an 8 minute walk from the apartment. We could also take the bus to and from Corfu town. Once we had rented our car  which we also found through Alexandros (https://1carental.com) we were super well connected to everywhere on the island as well while staying in Kokkini. I definitely recommend this car company  too. There was also parking right below the steps to the apartment which was great. There is a very delicious bbq restaurant down below the apartment as well and the supermarket is about an 18 minute walk/3 minute drive away. Overall  I cannot recommend this place enough! The location  the terrace view  the helpful host and much more made our Corfu vacation one to remember. Thank you to Alexandros and to your family for the best stay ever! Show more
26626389,Freek July 2021 We had a great stay here with a beautiful view around the area! Alexandros gave us a warm welcome and the apartment was amazing and very clean. We really enjoyed our time here!
26626389,Giorgia July 2021 Alexandros’ apartment with its breathtaking view is the perfect solution for couples or friends exploring the west coast of Corfu. The terrace overlooking the mountain was unique! The apartment looks new and clean - AC works perfectly. Alexandros is a very kind host and helped us with everything we needed during our stay.  Definitely recommended :)
26626389,Sophie June 2021 We had an amazing stay! the place is super cozy and looks exactly like in the pictures. worth mentioning is also that because the appartment is on the very top of a small village located on a hill  you get a nice breeze and it doesn't get too hot  which is a true blessing in the night!! it's also super private and quiet at night and you can see so many stars! 🤩 very romantic! walking down from the hill there is a small supermarket and a cute little tavern. Alexandros was a very friendly host and lives just downstairs  so it's easy to get to him if you would need something. clear recommendation!!
26626389,Miguel October 2020 Such an amazing view from the terrace looking to the sunset in Corfu. Small studio on top floor with a few ups and downs.  UPS 4 stoves and a great bbq in the terrace (amazing view) A lot of extras which saves you some good money: foil and film rolls  charcoal for bbq and ignition tablets  mosquito repelent plug (such a basic need in Corfu!) Intimacy and parking space for rental car...  DOWNS We weren't able to turn the oven on when the roast was ready to go in (even tho bbq served us as plan B). Small indoor space with no other place to seat than the bed. Water pressure is low and no curtain - mess after every shower! Knives need sharpen up  so frustrating.  Overall  we'd indeed stay again - but there's other options in the north of the island with more space and a full kitchen. Show more
26626389,Olivia September 2020 I just loved my stay at sunset studio. It is the most beautiful spot  with the most incredible view over the hills to the ocean. It is a quiet and special spot. The studio itself was spotless and had everything I needed. Alexandros was super helpful and responsive even though I arrived late at night. The whole experience was flawless. Hope I can go back soon!
26626389,Michal September 2020 Nice and equiped rooftop apartment (highest place in Kokkini ;) for 2 persons  a cozy place for your holiday. The marvelous terrace with superb BBQ. Sometimes and on some spots the WiFi is weak. Kokkini is a peaceful old village; one of the most suitable places to start your everyday explorations of the island. The most beautiful beaches on Corfu are nearby. I recommend! Thank you Alexandros!
26626389,Samuel August 2020 Perfect location if you want to explore the island and visit different beaches  particularly in the west and north coasts. I rented a quad bike and had a fantastic week exploring the island. The terrace is beautiful! Alexandros is a kind and attentive host  highly recommend.
26626389,Sannamaija February 2020 Apartment was very clean and cozy. View from the big terrace was realy beautiful. You need a car or some vehicle here.
26626389,Edgaras October 2019 Very cozy house in a great location. Very easy to reach all the north and west side beaches from the apartment. You won't need to go through the busy streets in the city. I would definitely recommend Alexandros place for your holidays.
26626389,Alex September 2019 We had an amazong time at Alexandros' place. The place itself is exactly as displayed in the Photos  and the view from the terrace is awesome  especially during sunset. Alexandros and his father took care of all our needs  we felt very welcome. Hihgly recommended for a longer stay on Corfu.
26626389,Daniela August 2019 My husband and I stayed in Alesandro’s studio for 3 nights during August. Incredible terrace and very peaceful view of the surroundings. The studio is more than enough for 2 persons and it’s equipped with everything you need and more.  Thanks Alesandro!
26626389,Jake June 2019 Alexandro’s place was perfect for our stay. It was very clean  and had amazing views. The balcony is spacious and lovely. It really was amazing  thank you Alexandro! We appreciated the touches like the candles and the comfy green sun loungers. Made our stay in Corfu very enjoyable.
26626389,Raphael June 2019 Great host and super cool apartment with a view! Close to beaches and Corfu town
26626389,Max May 2019 We had a wonderful stay at Alexandros place in Kokkini. The small flat in the middle of Korfu  is a perfect starting point to plenty of beaches in Korfu and to Korfu city. The view over the valley was perfect as promised. Communication with Alexandros was good and prompt. It was a really relaxing trip.
26626389,Astrid May 2019 Alexandros is a very friendly and nice host. The appartment was comfortable and cosy. Thank you for a good time in Kokkini :)
26626389,Katharina April 2019 We had a great time in Kokkini. The apartment has a beautiful terrace with a great view of the landscape. Kokkini is a great location for exploring all of Corfu by car as it is in the center of the island. The apartment is clean and the kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook yourself.
26626389,Joschua April 2019 It was a great time! The location is so great. We definitely want to come back in a few years and when its summer! We had everything we needed and the people are very very friendly. Thank you for that great holiday. :)
26626389,Tessa October 2018 We had a great time in Corfu. The apartment is perfectly located for trips around the island by car. Beaches and restaurants are not far away. Alexandros provided us with info about everything and we got welcomed by his mother. The place is great for a couple to stay and the terrace is just amazing. The neighbors are very friendly. So are their dogs. :-)  We definitely recommend a stay in kokkini!
26626389,Fenna October 2018 Great apartment just in the middle of the island. Explored the whole island and could easily go to the city in the evenings. Clean apartment which was also cleaned another time during our stay. Awesome view in a nice small village.
26626389,Maximilian September 2018 The Appartment is located in a backyard of a small village in the centre of the island. Alexandros and his family took really good care of us and they are helpful anytime. Thea room was cleaned after a couple of days and we get new towels and bedclothes. Wen enjoyed the sunset while we had a barbecue on the huge patio. The beautiful beach of Glyfada and Mirtiotissa is not far away (10-15 Min.) by car.
26626389,Виктор September 2018 The house is located in a small peaceful village. It is well furnished  very homely and comfortable. A large terrace's got an incredible view and is equipped with a brick BBQ  which came in very handy during our stay. Alexandros and his parents are very hospitable and friendly people  who are there to solve any issue without delay. I highly recommend the place and willing to come back the next year.
26626389,Marius August 2018 The appartment was clean and comfortable though the big terrace with the amazing view was definitely the best part!
26626389,Roel August 2018 We really enjoyed the stay. The apartment (top floor  clean  comfy) has a roof terrace with an amazing view of Corfu island. Alexandros was really friendly and helpful  for example helped us arrange a scooter to get across the island. Cost of scooter is around 20-25 euros. We do recommend renting a car or scooter. The town of Kokkini is small  quiet and not touristy. There is one very nice taverne at the foot of the hill the town is built on (5 minute walk). By scooter it is a 20 minutes drive to the nearest beaches and towns. Overall a great apartment to have had as HQ while exploring the island. Thank you Alexandros!!
26626389,Nina August 2018 The apartments are located in a small village  about 6 km to the nearest beach. To the bus stop and a small tavern about 7 minutes walk. The apartments are perfectly clean  freshly renovated  the furniture is almost new  there is everything for cooking. From the huge terrace offers a stunning view. The presence of a car  a motorcycle is mandatory. Alexandros kindly agreed to settle us ahead of time. I was lucky enough to get acquainted with his beautiful parents. I highly recommend this place to stay.
26626389,Sam July 2018 A stunning  stylish home that is immaculately clean. Located close to beaches and is tastefully decorated and has an huge balcony with a very beautiful view of corfu to look out on when you eat at the outside table. The kitchen is extremely well equipped  has an excellent oven and cooker  fridge and freezer but could do with a kettle. The hosts regularly provided new towels  fresh bed sheets and cleaned the home and were very welcoming. More than worth the price and would definitely stay again.
26626389,Alessandra October 2022 We stayed in this apartment for 3 nights. It is located in a small town  mini market on the main road to reach it. You need the car if you want to stay in this apartment. There are spiral stairs to get to it  so it might be a little uncomfortable for travelers with big suitcases  but it would be worth it. Alexandros is very kind and available for directions to the apartment and in its management. I also asked Alexandros for directions to which company to support me for renting a car and his advice was really helpful. It is a very quiet country and rest assured for those looking to get out of the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
26626389,Laetitia September 2022 original accommodation with a beautiful terrace but disappointing regarding the quality of the bedding where you can smell the springs from the mattress  the shower that is fixed on the sink  not very modern  and the kitchen with few utensils to cook  old pans that stick for example  and there is a duvet missing when it is cool! Otherwise clean accommodation  pleasant terrace when the weather is nice. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Guillaume September 2022 Accommodation with all amenities  the terrace is just wow. In addition Alexandros is very responsive and did everything to facilitate our arrival and setup. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Daniel August 2022 Charming little apartment in the heart of Corfu island. Located in a valley with beautiful views of the mountains and in the distance  the sea. We recommend this accommodation for its excellent value but also for all the amenities available (excellent air conditioning and free parking spaces). Alexandros was very available and was able to guide us throughout our stay! However  a vehicle is essential to visit the island. We hope to be back! Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Philippe August 2022 Very nice apartment with a beautiful terrace and a great view of the village  the surrounding area and even the sea in the distance. We enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend Alexandros's place  as long as you are motorized. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Jan July 2022 We enjoyed the apartment very much. Kokkini is a small idyllic place  located away from the tourist strongholds inland. It is therefore advisable to book a rental car  but the island can also be explored by bus. The bus stop is only a 5-minute walk from the property and the bus runs 6 times a day. The terrace is an absolute highlight. It was clean and tidy. The exchange with Alexandros worked smoothly  he was very accommodating. We would choose Kokkini and the apartment again at any time! Translated from German  Show original
26626389,Dominik June 2022 A simple  clean 1-room apartment with a large terrace and beautiful views. The narrow spiral staircase to the apartment is outdated and initially scared us a little. Our sensitive backs had a hard time getting used to the feather mattress. Alexandros was not on site  but the check-in and check-out were pleasant and straightforward. Alexandros always responded quickly and kindly. Best regards to Kokkini Translated from German  Show original Response from Alexandros June 2022 I apologize if the stairs of your house made you doubt its safety. I can guarantee you that it is completely safe  as you are only there for 6 years and you are maintained every year! I also apologize for the mattress of the bed if you are tired! It was my choice among thousands of mattresses to choose a classic spring mattress that you would recommend for hotels  and so far I have not had any customer complaints  but that does not mean that I do not understand that one mattress is not for all tastes.Regards Alex!

26626389,Aude May 2022 This place is a little slice of heaven with beautiful views and away from the tourist hustle and bustle. Having a car is a must to fully enjoy this accommodation and be able to navigate the island in complete freedom. The accommodation is comfortable and the views are really beautiful at sunrise and sunset. Alexandros is very responsive and available to give advice and directions on staying in this beautiful island! Looking forward to coming back! Translated from French  Show original

26626389,Lonneke July 2019 The apartment has a beautiful view and terrace. It was wonderful to sit here. I myself am quickly bothered by my back and the bed has bothered me a lot from my back this vacation. That was a small downside. Furthermore  the apartment is super clean. We found the shower a bit less as you have to hold it yourself and the jet is on the small side. The well of the shower also smells.  The location of the apartment is ideal if you want to discover the island from different sides. Everything is easy and quick to reach by car or scooter.  Alexandros is very hospitable and always ready to help. He responds super quickly and is very nice.  We had a good holiday in this apartment. Translated from Dutch  Show original

49837107,Uriel October 2022 The villa was explant  quiet with great view  fully equipped and convenient. We loved it. Leon and his team were very helpful and ready to solve any problem.
49837107,M October 2022 Please use the other message. Thanks
49837107,Joanne September 2022 We really couldn't fault anything (apart from the track  which has already been mentioned). The villa is beautiful  exceptionally clean and very well-equipped. The service while we were there was brilliant - regular towel and sheet changes and cleaning to a very high standard. The pool was beautiful and just the right temperature. There were plenty of tavernas within walking distance. We particularly liked Byron's and Piazza. We were also well placed to explore the island. Finally  everything was extremely well-managed by the property manager  Leon. He was so attentive and very quick to return any queries. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you!
49837107,Phoebe June 2022 Such an amazing location About 30-40 minutes from town but the manager happily arranged transfers Beautiful views never wanted to leave Great recommendations for local cuisine and beach only a short walk away
49837107,Howie May 2022 Stayed at the West villa in May 2022. Stunning villa in immaculate condition with amazing views of the ocean. Leon and George were excellent hosts and were quick to respond to any questions. The villa was also cleaned almost every day during our stay with pool also cleaned every few days. I would however highlight the hill to access the property is exceptionally steep  making it challenging to drive up with a full car. Also  note that the swimming pool does not have a shallow end  I am 5ft 9 inches and could stand on my tip toes at one end of the pool only. Therefore  extra caution is required if travelling with kids who are not yet able to swim. Overall  a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it  the place is stunning and excellent service provided throughout.
49837107,Stephanie May 2022 We really enjoyed our stayed at the house Leon and his team were very helpful. The Villa is very good maintained and view very beautiful. Also very nice bar a restaurant in the town. Surely recommend this place.
49837107,Anna May 2022 The house is beautiful (the best beds ever!)  the location is fantastic and the view is simply gorgeous. Communication with the owner and the level of service he provided was the best. We had a wonderful week here with our family of four boys (age 9-15)  would definitely recommend!
49837107,"Jane April 2022 All I can say is ""wow"" what a fantastic villa in an amazing location with stunning views across the ocean. The villa had everything you could possibly wish for and more. The service we received was outstanding  nothing was too much trouble with great communication from the team. Quite simply it gets little better than this with the best recommendation we can give being that we are definitely going back !!!"
49837107,Evigna September 2021 This is a beautiful and modern house with a fantastic pool and sea views. Anything you'd want is available  from sun chairs to BBQ grills  outdoor and indoor lounge area  equipped kitchen and mosquito nets for all windows! The communication was easy and fast and the welcome basket was very thoughtful. Definitely a place to stay for longer than just a few days! The only thing to know is that it's a steep uphill with the car  our super tiny car just barely made it (due to the weight of passengers  luggage and AirCon ;-) )
49837107,Maya September 2021 We were staying at this amazing villa 7 friends. We couldn't ask for more than this (its even better than the pictures). The host was super friendly  He took care of anything including a pickup from the airport and arranging a chef who cooked us greek meal. The view from the swimming pool is absolutely gorgeous  all is tidy and clean  the interior design is beautiful and the kitchen is fully aquipped. We will definitely come back!
49837107,Daniel July 2021 We (family of 4) really enjoyed our stay in this stunning villa. We appreciated the privacy enormously. We received the villa very clean and well maintained. The lovingly furnished villa made the stay perfect. Communication with the landlord was always straightforward and our questions were answered quickly. We enjoyed our vacation to the fullest and I can't report anything negative. I can recommend this villa 100%.
49837107,George July 2021 Beautiful villa with stunning sea view! It's brand new  comfortable and luxurious! The fully equipped kitchen is perfect for families with young children. The outdoor area with the large infinity swimming pool provides great view to the Ionian Sea from every point. Perfect place to relax. Highly recommended for families or group of friends.
49837107,Alex July 2021 This is a great villa which I highly recommend to everyone who can fit into 4 luxury bedrooms each with a bathroom of it's own. The house is brand new. architects and designers spend a lot of time figuring out how to make it beautiful for everyone. Everything is modern and yet very Greek. The views  the pool  everything was amazing. The host helped us with restaurant reservations. Top villa for the money. Great.
35058113,Sixing January 2023 Nina and her family are so nice and kind，and house is really lovely and clean，I think maybe I will come again in the October haha！
35058113,Nerija November 2022 It was amazing stay! The host Nina was very kind and thoughful. We got some stuff for breakfast and some local wine from Nina's dad. The house is very cute and has everything you need for your stay. The backyard and the view from it is spectacular..We felt like home. The restaurants and beaches are very close. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT! We hope we can come back soon❤️
35058113,Darren October 2022 Nina's place was AMAZING. She is the most incredible host and from start to finish  we felt so welcomed  comfortable  safe and happy staying in her place. Her welcome gift of homemade wine was so wonderful  but there was so much more. She had eggs  bread  juice  coffee  water  and so much more waiting for us  which was so much appreciated. We were so happy staying in her place  with many different options of tables  chairs  hammocks  and spaces ready for us to relax in  looking out over the Mediterranean. The space was so well-equipped  the bed so comfortable  the shower hot  the WiFi good  the place so clean  cozy and wonderful. We'd return in a heartbeat. Such an incredible place with such an incredible host!
35058113,Joe October 2022 Better than advertised!  Everything was perfect about the property  the photos dont do it justice. We arrived to a bottle of homemade wine (made by ninas dad).  Nina was very a great host  always making sure we were well catered for. During a storm the power went out and she arrived within 10 mins with her dad to fix the power. Would definitely reccomed this property.  Also  a car is handy getting to the beach and back.
35058113,Jule October 2022 We had a wonderful time at Ninas place. The garden is so lovely decorated and the view is breathtaking. We enjoyed every minute. Nina was always very helpful and caring. We absolutly recommend to go there
35058113,Mona October 2022 Such a great place. Nina is the most amazing and kind host  she made our stay so special. The house provides you with everything you need in a home away from home. It has a terasse and garden with great sea view  and beautiful surroundings like olive trees and the sweet village of Pentati with great restaurants. Thanks for everything!
35058113,Isaac September 2022 Nina’s place was so beautiful! It is a perfect place to have a getaway from the loudness of a busy city. Nina and her family were so amazing it was like being greeted by my own family. Very hospitable and good vibes all round ❣️❣️❣️. Nina left some homemade wine which was delicious! ‼️‼️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 can’t wait to come back soon! 🙂
35058113,Marko September 2022 Wonderful place and amazing family  we realy felt like we have holidays with extended family. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we will definitely come back..  Marko & Martina
35058113,Julia September 2022 We had a very enjoyable stay at Nina’s place and didn’t want to leave. It’s clean  fully equipped and the garden is so pretty with olive trees  lots of flowers and views of the sea and sunset. Nina is very friendly  attentive and helpful. A car is probably the best way to get around the area but there are some lovely tavernas and beaches within walking distance.
35058113,Catherine September 2022 Nina's place is in such beautiful place! There are wonderful sea views from the windows  the patio and the garden! The house is small and comfortable  with everything you need. The WiFi is good and I had good signal in the garden too. There are fans to keep the air moving  and excellent mosquito screens at all the windows and the door. She has thought of everything even providing anti-bug spray and slippers! She left us homemade wine and also food and coffee for the next morning  which was great! She gave us excellent advice about a lovely taverna and an amazing beach and we were able to pick peaches out the garden! It's definitely a place to have a hire car and the roads are a bit of an adventure  but we had a wonderful time and loved lying in the hammock looking at the amazing view! Nina helped us with all our queries and is so kind and attentive.
35058113,Gabriel August 2022 A very nice and romantic spot with a spectacular view of the see  in a quite surrounding. At first we were a little concerned about the distances to all major interest points of the island  but coming with our car made things a little easier. The roads to the property were not the best I've ever drove  but there were asphalt works in progress during our stay  so the things will surely be better for future hosts. Nina is a great host  doing her best to make you feel welcome and a great communicator. So  thank tou  Nina for fully contributing to my family's holiday success!
35058113,Luísa August 2022 After staying in Pentati last year  we had to come again to experience Nina’s wonderful hospitality and the easiness of being in this magical place. Everything is perfect  the location  the place  the food  the nature  but the best is Nina and her family. They make everything great and fun! We will come back as much as we can!
35058113,Daisy August 2022 We had a wonderful stay Nina is so lovely and helpful when we arrived there was homemade wine which was so good. We had fun at all the near by beaches and would recommend staying here (having a rental car is probably easier)
35058113,Elena July 2022 We really enjoyed two weeks we spent in Nina's house. It is exceptionally clean and comfortable and perfectly equipped so you don't suffer from mosquitos  heat nor anything else. I appreciated the bathroom - hot and cold water runs smoothly and it is well ventilated. The place is very private  the garden is safe for children. Nina is an amazing host  she is always available and helpful. The location is little populated  very calm. In the nearby village there are great tavernas and a shop and the beach is 5 minutes diving from the house.
35058113,Jessica May 2022 The place is beautiful and perfect for relaxing. Nina is a lovely person and always ready to help. Can only recommend it!!
35058113,Gordon May 2022 We had a lovely stay at Nina’s house  which is simple but perfect. We especially liked the garden  and the hammock and swinging chair  with their beautiful ambiance  and great views of the sunset. The house had everything we needed and more  and we enjoyed walking to Pentati  and it’s tiny  and in our experience empty  beach. We also liked Paranoma (sp?) Beach. And enjoyed both tavernas at Pentati and Paranoma - Angela’s was delightfully informal. Nina helped at every stage  and was always quick to answer questions and give advice.
35058113,Lena April 2022 We had a fantastic time. Nina is a great and caring host  from the start (helping us to get to the house from the airport) right to the end. We were welcomed with home made vine  into the clean nice little house with a extraordinary view from the terasse and even the bedroom window! Nina was available our whole stay and gave us great tipps for locations  hiking routes and places to go around the area. We're planning on coming back one day soon! Thanks for everything :-)
35058113,Jihee April 2022 Nina was a super host. We were contacting per whatsapp and she always reminded us that she‘s there for any help.  We were at corfu for few days just to rest  and ninas house suited us perfectly. Big garden with nice view of the ocean  the neighbours were very nice and friendly. Theres also a beach 10-15min away by foot. The only thing was that the wifi didn’t work very good  but you dont need it when you are there. Once again thank you nina for your welcoming :) hope to be there again.
35058113,Martina October 2021 We had the most awesome family holiday at Nina‘s place. The hospitality of the Greek people is outstanding. The family of Nina gave us not only a very beautiful Place to stay  also their friendship and life stories. We will never forget the experience of having a home away from home. The place is amazing to chill out  the view of the ocean is magical and the wine tasty. 15/10 points and more - I recommend going to Corfu and staying at this hotel place at least once in a lifetime.
35058113,Anne Christine October 2021 Wonderful view from a beautiful garden
35058113,Luísa August 2021 Like visiting a friend  staying at Nina’s place feels like being at home away from home. Me and my family were welcomed with generous warmth that made our stay memorable. All details were taken care of  from umbrellas for the beach to mosquito bites treatment. Nina and her family are professional hosts  looking after the people they welcome in an outstanding manner  but they do it in such a natural way that you can’t help but falling in love with the place  the people  the food. This is a jewel location for families that want to escape the busier parts of the island and have a true local experience with the benefits of the modern times. There’s nothing that can be improved we just hope Nina keeps her house open so we can go back next year!
35058113,Katharina August 2021 Our stay was amazing! The scenery is beautiful with seaview and Chillout area under the olivetrees! The communication was also very pleasent! Thank you Nina for all the speacial information and for having us!!
35058113,Lauren August 2021 Nina is possibly the most wonderful host I've had yet with airbnb. Extremely helpful and friendly. She even found out the age of our baby which we realised was to leave us some nappies for her in the correct size! She had really thought of everything. The place is absolutely beautiful  the garden is stunning  covered in olive trees  plants and beautiful flowers and has a sea view which can be enjoyed from the rocking chair on the patio  the table  the hammock  the swing or the chair swing - paradise! We will definitely only consider staying here when we go back.
35058113,H July 2021 What an amazing place to stay on Corfu. The fist thing you have to know is the spectacular view from the lovely garden with al it’s flowers  old olive trees. Great view at the blue sea en mostly every day sunset. It’s quite and we loved it. Big private garden with hangmat  cosy chairs and tables. The house had everything you need and is very well equipped. It is a traditional small house big enough for two people. And than we have Nina! She is so helpful with everything. She answers directly en is so kind and friendly. Highly recommended! If we have to point out what we missed is maybe the airco. The ventilators where good so we didn’t miss it. And we find out Greek people like quit hard beds.
35058113,Livia July 2021 Nina is a great host  she was totally helpful for every need and question we had and her place is simply amazing: the garden ist wonderful to enjoy the fresh wind from the see and incredible sunsets  the house is tiny but completely equipped with all you can need on holiday and even more. We would be happy to spend some days at Nina's again  thank you!
35058113,Teresa June 2021 We had an amazing time at Mantzaros Traditional House! It is a wonderful place. Even more beautiful than the pictures can tell. It is peaceful  calm  cozy and has a very beautiful view. We had everything we needed and even more. Nina is such a lovely and caring host. Thank you very much  Nina  we are very glad to meet you and your lovely family. We are looking forward to visit you again soon! Response from Nina June 2021 Tereza and Daniel were a great couple. Very polite. So excited when they got home. We had very nice communication.Great people.
35058113,Alena June 2021 We had the Most beautiful stay at Nina’s place  the house an garden designed with lots of love and it’s very well-equipped  you’ll have everything you need  even games for the beach! The area is quite  a 20 minute Walk or 5 minute drive through olive gardens to the small village Pentati. Beaches in the area were not crowded at all  it was the perfect Place to escape city crowds and noises. Nina and all of her family are very nice hosts who are always available to give recommendations about beaches and tavernas in the area. Her dad makes the tastiest honey wine. Thank you very much!!!
35058113,Carmen June 2021 Everything is perfect. Authentic greek house in the middle of an olive forest. Two nice beaches 5' by car. The house has all kind of comodities   Many things for breakfast and nice garden. Nina is wonderful : helpfull  friendly and with very easy comunication. Also her father who we made fun with. Taberna CHRIS PLACE near Nina's is a wonderful recommendation to eat. Response from Nina June 2021 Carmen and Maria are two great friends with very positive energy! Their Mediterranean tamperament contributed to a beautiful communication! I would like to host them again during a new covid free season !
35058113,Alessandra June 2021 We stayed one week at Nina‘s magical place and had wonderful vacations with the most beautiful sunset from the garden. The place is very calm located between olive trees and the sea. In the house we found everything (even more) we needed in that time. Nina prepared some stuff for the first breakfast and cared for us the whole stay very well. She had always good advices for trips also she was aviable for us the whole time at whatsapp. Her father came around  we had some nice talks  he welcomed us with homemade wine and we could order some of the best Fish we ate - with some cooking advices on top. We are so thankful we could stay in that little place of heaven on earth and met Nina and her lovely Family. Thank you so much for everything 🌷 Response from Nina June 2021 Semir and Alessandra were amazing guests  a beautiful young couple  we had nice communication. I would be very happy to host them again .
35058113,Miriam May 2021 We have been there for 2 weeks with 2 little kids. We had such a great time. The house is cozy and especially the garden is amazing! The view is spectacular and the kids could play safely.  While there are many tourists at the rest of corfu  this area is very quiet  But the best is nina and her family. They are so nice. They brought fresh fishes and octopus and homemade wine.  Totally recommendable!
35058113,Lukasz August 2020 Do not go there. Do not build another hotel! Just leave this place as it is 😀 Calm with nature. Wish more places were like this one. Nina is super host! Big up!
35058113,Dmitrij August 2020 Me and my gf had an amazing stay at Nina`s house. This house and area is perfect for those people  who like peaceful and authentic vacation. It is away from tourists  loud city noises and similar things  which may steal your peace. It is located between Pentati and Paramonas villages (or even small towns  with local people) in olive forest  with stunning coast and mountain view. Therefore you`ll be able to try amazing traditional Greek food  hear beautiful singing from Church while walking in the evening in Pentati. -> I`d recommend to visit Angela`s taverna. Big beaches are also not far away  only about 15 min. ride by car: Paralia Agios Cordios and Paralia Paramona (Paramonas beach). We traveled by car and within 5 days we were able to see most of the Corfu. Nina`s house has absolutely everything you may need during your stay. It is very clean and was above any expectations. Nina was very kind and thoughtful  we arrived in the late evening and she bought some food for us to eat  as well as bottle of vine  which her father produces locally. You may also order fresh seafood from Nina  as her dad runs a fish store :) We bought and cooked some fresh prawns  which were delicious. I`d highly recommend that option. Nina`s father visited us as well  told us the story of the village  farm itself. We had a great talk  he is a wonderful person with generous heart.  Nina was very responsive to answer our questions and guide us  she was always online per WhatsApp to send us locations and tips. We had clean sheets and towels the whole time. There is a big area in front of the house (garden) just for you  at night you can lay down into hammock with a glass of vine  relax  listen to the sea and look at the shore in the moonlight. <3  My only advice/tip for visitors would be to rent a good car  as Corfu is a mountainous terrain in general. :)  We`d definitely like to come again and 100% recommend this amazing place of Nina`s.  Best wishes  Show more
35058113,Amelie August 2020 Nina‘s house is everything is says in the description and more. The house itself is small but cozy  fully equipped  and completely spotless. From the hammock and swing in the backyard you can watch the sunset with a glass of wine that Nina‘s father made himself. The area is perfect for anyone who wants to get away from masses of tourists. Everyone in the area knows and helps each other and we felt incredibly at home. I‘d recommend renting a scooter (at Nina‘s best friend‘s place) since the house is sort of in the middle of nowhere  but even if you don‘t  there are still beautiful beaches you can walk to. I think Nina is the best host I‘ve had in my life. She helped us rent the scooter  answered any question immediately  called a supermarket to check at what time they‘d open (since it was a holiday)  and even dropped us off at the airport. I can‘t recommend her place enough and I will definitely be back one day.
35058113,Agata July 2020 This place is special. You can really relax there. The house is cosy and equipped with everything you need and more. The view from the olive grove surrounding the house is outstanding. If only I could  I'd like to come there every year. And Nina is the kindest and most caring host I have met on Airbnb.
35058113,Mag March 2020 Nina's place was great. Nina and her family made us feel like home. We highly recommend this place!
35058113,Daniel October 2019 Perfect spot for a quiet getaway in a less frequented corner of the island. The house is small yet absolutely cozy and has everything you need  with a spacious terrace perfect for yoga and an even more spacious garden of olive trees  shady enough to keep cool but still offering a perfect view. Nina is absolutely amazing and thoughtful  she provided us with all kinds of useful things from mosquito repellent through binoculars to a sewing kit. The kitchen was equipped with basic spices and the fridge had some starter food in it. Anything we asked for  she provided in an instance. She regularly inquired about our wellbeing but without being pushy or intruding on our privacy. Highly recommended!
35058113,Peter September 2019 Nina is very kind  the house is really nice  clean and well-equipped. The view from the garden is amazing. Absolutely recommended  if you plan to rent a car.
35058113,Tonka September 2019 Nina's place is a little hidden treasure. As we had no gps  we took some time to find the place  but Nina gave us instructions and came to pickus up. The house is tiny  and is equipped for a self-catering holiday. The house is so well isolated that it kept cool on hot days too and the ceiling fans are effective. The olive garden is very nicely arranged  with seating and resting equipment and flowers. We liked watching the sunset from the terrace or the garden. Nina is a fantastic host  caring and relaxed. You need a car to access this place  but once there the village (for shopping and restaurants) and the beaches are close driving. There are also some interesting tourist spots close-by. There is safe free private parking at the house. We gladly recommend Nina's place.
35058113,Christian August 2019 We had a really nice time in this well equipped and very clean accommodation. This calm place with a great view over the sea is a good place to calm down and relax. We enjoyed the shadow in garden with the hammocks so much. As it is located in the middle of the western coast  we could easily discover the north and the south of Korfu (with our scooter/Vespa). Swimming and snorkelling was possible and really nice in the bays nearby (by Vespa). Nina is a great host and was disposable for all our questions and needs. She even invited us to a church celebration where we danced Sirtaki together and ate traditional greek food. We can definitely recommend to stay at Nina’s place.
35058113,Vinca August 2019 The first reason you have to choose this house in Corfu is to have the chance to meet its amazing owner  Nina  as well as her family. Nina is an exceptional person whose generosity is only matched by her cheerfulness. It's also someone you can truly rely on during your stay as I have experienced it! In short  the best possible host! And I thank her a thousand times for her hospitality. The small house in the middle of an olive grove is charming  very clean and well equipped. The outside is all the charm with the large terrace and hammocks at the end of the field with a magnificent view of the sunset. We stayed a week and we made every day very beautiful discoveries all around the island. Take care Nina & see you soon! 😊
35058113,Ted August 2019 Mother and daughter had a wonderful peaceful stay at Mantzaros House. Sparkling clean with all the touches of home overlooking incredible views of ocean and coastline. Nina and her family were kind and generous hosts and We felt so lucky to have met them. A true local experience in an authentic natural environment of Corfu. You definitely need a car. We hope to return some day. This is a really beautiful special place run by hosts who really care their guests have a positive experience.
35058113,Nicholas July 2019 Easily the best host I have ever experienced with an Airbnb stay. Nina was so hospitable and made our stay incredible. We felt very safe  welcome and at home the whole time. I wish every host could match Nina!!!!! Thank you so much. I definitely recommend to anyone wanting an amazing stay in Corfu :)
35058113,Andy July 2019 A beautiful corner of traditional Corfu  off the beating track so download directions to your sat nav beforehand as reception can be spotty on the way. Angela's taverna up the road is great and there's everything from beaches to supermarkets a short drive away.
35058113,"Zoli July 2019 This house has an amazing view of the sea  we had great breakfasts there. The house is very close to ""Pentati"" a lovely village with 2 best restaurants of Corfu. You need a car  but it definitely worth it  the host is very kind and helpful with everything! :)"
35058113,Annakarin June 2019 We stayed for one week and we really loved the place. It's quiet and beautiful with an astonishing view over the sea. The house was perfect for us (two adults and one little child)  it had everything we could need and it was perfectly clean. The garden was wonderful. We had all meals outside  in the shadows of the olive trees. We enjoyed the hammocks so much  watching the sea and the sunset. During our visit the plums in the garden where ripe  sweet and delicious! There is a private parking place in the garden (you will need a car). Nina is the sweetest and most helpful host I have ever met. She received us so well and made everything she could to make our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible.  About the surroundings: Pentati village is a very nice  calm and picturesque village  with a very cute minimarket with a terrace  and the charming and tasty restaurant Angela's. There are many nice beaches nearby.  I can highly recommend this place to travelers who want something less touristic  close to the nature  calm and romantic. Show more
35058113,Marc November 2022 Super nice location and property. The house has absolutely everything you need and Nina is the most helpful and friendly hostess you could ask for. Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Andreas October 2022 This house has everything you need and is well equipped. Here you can nest in for three weeks and would not need to leave the house  but who wants that on vacation? Everything is very lovingly decorated  both in the house and in the garden. Nina takes care of everything in an abundance and loving way. The only reason I have to take a star off is because unfortunately you do not have evening sun when you come home from the hiking tours or swimming afternoons  as the house and garden are completely embedded under ancient olive trees. In high summer probably awesome  but not in October. Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Laurence August 2022 It's an extraordinary garden with sea views  a little piece of paradise maintained by Nina and her parents... The welcome is just as perfect   Nina is very present if needed and attentive...Thank you for a lovely week Nina   we hope to come back ... it was great. Laurence and Alain Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Alexis August 2022 The place  the garden  the view  the location  everything is wonderful. Nina's welcome is very kind  she is lovely. The area is worth it  it is some of the most unspoiled in Corfu. Our stay was perfect. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Emmanuelle July 2022 We had a great time at Nina's place! The house is very nice and what to say about the garden and the sea view which is beautiful! Although it is not far from a road it is very quiet  well-equipped  super efficient fans keep the house cool  we slept very well. Nina gave us good advice for restaurants and a great beautiful beach not far from the house. She booked for us because the WIFI is a little finicky and our phones sometimes had trouble working...  Nina had planned small gifts on arrival and breakfast supplies...we can only recommend NIna's house. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Anne-Marie July 2022 Our stay at Nina's was beautiful and magical.  The House: Very clean. You're all caught up. There are screens on the windows and doors  from fans to the ceiling. When we arrived (late)  we were happy to find everything we needed for our next-day breakfast in the fridge. A lovely welcome gift awaited us. The beds were made and the towels nicely folded.  The terrace and garden: One word  magic! The terrace  with its table and chairs  is beautifully decorated with plants. There is a rocking chair to enjoy the sea view and rest. The garden is magical. It is a true olive grove with a hammock  swing  hanging chair. Under the sound of cicadas  you can admire the sea. There is an enchanting view  especially at the end of the day  where you can admire the sunset each night. We didn't miss any of them! This was the mandatory end of day appointment! You can park the car easily. Pentati is a short drive away. There's a great hostel where Nina's sister works. We ate here several nights happily every time. Thanks to Sophia  the lovely and kind waitress.  And there's Nina and her family: Nina went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. She's so thoughtful  and you can tell she and her family love to host. She was able to advise us  was considerate. Thanks again to everyone we met for their hospitality and kindness. Especially Nina's dad who gave us grilled fish and wine  thank you for the good stories and also thanks to his wife.  Thank you for your smiles  good humor  thoughtfulness and kindness. We won't forget you.  It's the big heart that we left.  See you soon Nina  I hope.  Anne-Marie  Juliet and Nicolas:-) Show more Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Patrick June 2022 This place is just amazing! The house offers everything you need  the garden is pure nature and the view of the sea is breathtaking! Hostess Nina and her parents are just adorable and warm. Absolutely recommended! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,"Petra June 2022 We stayed in this beautiful place for 12 days! I agree with all previous positive reviews! Nina is really a very warm host and always trying to make it as beautiful as possible for you. Always available  responds very quickly  has good tips for excursions and taverns. The garden with hammock and hammock chair is a treat and the sunsets from there are really a dream! The house is small  but nice! Clean and everything you need available. The terrace of us is used a lot to eat and sit together. Car essential in my opinion. Streets also partly adventurous on the island - potholes and narrow streets  but you get used to them. Beaches not within walking distance  but by car/scooter no problem  few minutes. Supermarket similar. There are several taverns within a few minutes. The area is much less ""lit up"" by tourists compared to other corners of Corfu. Which we found very pleasant and had hoped for. Translated from German  Show original"
35058113,Lisa May 2022 The small cozy cottage with a beautiful view leaves nothing to be desired. The terrace is wonderful and you have the perfect view of the sunset. Nina is a wonderful host who is always available for questions and tips. We felt very comfortable in the 2 weeks:) Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Sabine April 2022 If you want to have it quietly  you love to watch the sun sinking between up to 1000-year-old olive trees  this is the place to be. Nina is a host who is with all her heart to her guests  always and at any time. The apartment is really equipped with EVERYTHING you need. The fridge was already full and there was homemade wine.  We actually never travel to the same place a second time.... so far 😀 Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Gilles April 2022 The garden and its stunning sea views are the major asset of this accommodation. We really enjoyed the hospitality and availability of Nina and her dad. We felt like it was people who love to host and connect. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Michel April 2022 The stay exceeded our expectations. The house is lovingly and very tastefully decorated. Nothing is missing. The garden also keeps what the pictures promise. A gigantic view  a variety of plants and lush greenery. Nina was an excellent host. We were received very warm and friendly  even the fridge was filled with all kinds of things (eggs  bread  milk  juice  cornflakes and croisannts & spread). I was there with my 4 year old son for a getaway. The garden is absolutely safe and small explorers find plenty of space here. The nearest beach is a few minutes' walk away and if you want to go a little further  Nina has the right tips. I'm sure we'll be back! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Lydia August 2021 Nina was a super host  we were welcomed with wine and a full fridge. She gave us numerous tips  was always available. Her parents gave us fresh fish. The house is fantastically located  directly above the sea  you have your peace  yet come quickly to Pentati or to the Paramonas Beach  in 30 minutes you are in Corfu city. We recommend renting a car or a Vespa. Overall  a perfect place to unwind!👍👍👍 Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Hakim July 2021 We loved our stay at Nina's home! We were blown away by the beautiful garden and the sea view. It is a real haven of peace that we couldn't wait to find after visiting the various tourist sites during the day. All the must-see places in Corfu are very easily accessible from the house by car. On foot  you can also access various very charming and intimate beaches. Nina and her father went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. We loved talking to Nina's father who regularly brought us his homemade wine. He also brought us some freshly caught shrimp and fish and helped us prepare them. We absolutely don't regret our choice and hope to come back soon ! Translated from French  Show original
35058113,"Louis July 2021 As soon as we arrived  we were seduced by the bohemian style of the garden. Nina gave us a tour and explained the place as well as everything she had prepared for our first breakfast to be great. Nina told us about the places for the beach  groceries and meals at the taverns ( I recommend Angela). The whole house is filled with provisions  utensils  unimaginable things that can help ""just in case."" What to expect. The view is magnificent under the sound of cicadas. We went to the tavernas and the beach on foot via romantic paths. Translated from French  Show original"
35058113,Jean June 2021 This is really a beautiful place  everything is top notch. Nina and her family are very welcoming. The village next door is very pretty  the sea nearby and it's also wow! A great place to stay and visit the rest of the island. Translated from French  Show original Response from Nina July 2021 Wonderful couple with their little daughter Loulou. We had beautiful communication.would gladly host them again.
35058113,Fabian October 2020 Beautiful and lovingly furnished cottage with a wonderful garden. There you can have a good breakfast and look at the sea. The accommodation includes everything you need. Even the fridge was stocked with food items by Nina for the first breakfast. We also got two bottles of their delicious wine. Since we were at home at her place for a total of 11 days  she brought us fresh towels and changed the bedding halfway through the time. All in all  Nina is an extremely enthusiastic and caring host!  The property is suitable for people who like it quiet and secluded. The nearest place (Pentati)  where there are two tasty taverns  is 2 5 km away from the property. That is why and because the accommodation is rather remote  we advise you to rent a rental car. This allows you to explore the island well. We thank Nina and felt very comfortable in her accommodation and on the beautiful island of Corfu! Translated from German  Show original

35058113,Pascal October 2020 Nina is an exceptional host we were hosted terribly  with great care. Everything was there to start our stay  the well-stocked fridge  wine made by her dad  and a lot more that we have never seen anywhere else. We stayed for 1 month  Nina was always attentive to make our stay as pleasant as possible. She brought us fish to grill  wine and a lot of little things to make us happy. We had the chance to meet her family   very endearing people and despite the language barrier we had unforgettable moments with them. Nina's house wonderfully matches what we're looking for. Far from the tourist resorts  a haven of peace with crazy charm tranquility and magnificent views of the west coast of Corfu. And as a bonus  magnificent sunsets each night. Neighborhood is a beautiful island very green we were able to see all aspects of the island. What to say plus  everything was perfect. Contrary to our habit of never going back to the same place  we'll go back. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Frank September 2020 Fantastic house including garden with magical view! Super nice and thoughtful hostess! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Lidia July 2020 Nina's incredible hospitality  running across the street from every need  made our stay extra comfortable. The place is beautiful  the photos don't capture its charm. The home is secluded  so it's convenient to have a car (it's affordable to rent at the airport). Nina thought of everything from Covid 19 fluids and disinfectant wipes  through welcome wine  first breakfast products  to cosmetics and even pads! It was clean and lovely everywhere. I recommend it sincerely for those who like peace and quiet. Translated from Polish  Show original
35058113,Léo Nico July 2020 It is close to the small village of Pentati  standing on its centuries-old cliff that you will find at the turn of a snake road: Nina's small house. Nestled in a green setting where the olive trees mingle on which cicadas lounge  you will find the house at the turn of a small path that leads to the large terrace. There you will be welcomed by Nina  who for us  despite a late hour  opened her door to us with a smile like the island: warm. The house is not big  but everything is there to feel good. Whether it was for the different rooms that make up it or for the multiple touches left on site by our host (Nina was kind enough to buy us something to have breakfast the next morning). When we first woke up  the enchanting continued realizing that the garden overlooked the Ionian Sea. Going up to a small table in the shade of the olive trees you will reach one of the most beautiful views of the house: a gazebo that overlooks part of the west coast of the island  here you can dream the cliffs dip in the Mediterranean and hear in the early morning and for the rest of the day: the melody of the waves. Nearby  a 15-minute walk  you can walk along the uncrowded road that leads down to a small stone path down into a small fishing port. There you can swim in the turquoise waters of Corfu island. And if you're lucky  just like us  maybe the beach is yours for a swim. Nina  since the beginning  has always made it easy for every part of our trip  and I'm sure  one of the keys to her success. So I can't recommend your stay at her place enough  because the house is just like the person: welcoming  warm and caring. Thank you for this stay  and we hope so: see you soon.

35058113,Sonja November 2019 Nina is a super host! She picked us up cigar from the airport and drove us there! If you had any questions  she was immediately available and gave you all the information you need! The house is super nice  well equipped and has a great location. You could easily reach everything with a rental car and also on foot. There were wonderful holidays we spent there we can only recommend it and would want to stay there again any time if we come to Corfu again! Best wishes Sonni and Tanja Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Damien September 2019 Nina's place is very nice  very quiet and pretty well located for visiting the south of the island. The equipment is of very good quality and it has everything you need for a pleasant stay. Nina is very friendly and present if needed. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Chloé September 2019 Nina's house and her garden under the olive trees with sea views are really more than charming  the very warm welcome  the house with everything you need in it. Nina gave us a small deserted beach address right next to the house  brought wine made by her father  we were also able to have fish and octopus to grill on the barbecue. In addition  nature is beautiful and this corner of Corfu remains sheltered from resorts. We highly recommend this rental and these perfect hosts! Thank you very much. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Iris June 2019 A beautiful holiday home with a large garden and fantastic views. If you are looking for a quiet place to feel good  this is the place to be. Nina was an attentive host  was always available for us and we felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Frederic October 2022 My best experience with Airbnb! Crazy place  2 meters from the sea! All the commodities to kitchen  to rest and to listen radio / watch TV . Very quiet place  5 minutes from the village.
576002487041317086,Ragi September 2022 Axilleas cottage is a little dream come true! We had the best time there  everything is like you see it in the pictures and the description. If you’re looking for a place to relax and forget the world - then this is your spot to go. He welcomed us with fruits and self made wine and was every time available. The little dog and the cats are all well educated and are just adorable. If we’re ever going to Korfu again  we’re definitely going again to Axillea and this beautiful place.
576002487041317086,Franziska September 2022 Axilleas’ place truly is a little paradise. Somewhat hidden offside the road and with the Mediterranean right in front of the doorstep (not exaggerating!)  it is the perfect getaway if you’re looking to rest. The little stone cottage might look small from the outside  but feels bigger once you’re inside  and offers practically everything you need…fridge  stove  coffee machine  shower  wardrobe  a tv set (which feels somewhat redundant)  etc. Axilleas will often be in the neighboring shack  do his thing without ever disturbing you. He’s a paramount example of friendliness and always quick to help if help is needed.  The cottage is literally in the middle of nowhere  with the nearest (and very commendable) taverna being a 20-minute walk  and the next supermarket an estimated 45-minute walk away. We recommend renting some sort of motorized vehicle to be mobile. We rented a little quad at the taverna  paying €80 for the 3 days and it turned out to be the best decision as you wouldn’t want to schlep all the bottled water from the supermarket. We used the tap water twice to brew coffee and it didn’t kill us or anything  but it’s definitely no drinking water. We recommend shopping at Lidl as it is far less expensive than the Masoutis supermarket which is slightly closer to the cottage. (Masoutis has oat milk tho)  Some advice on top: Best bring some earplugs  as the rushing sea can be quite irritating at times  the more so if you’re a light sleeper. The fridge unfortunately adds to it. It’s not awfully loud all in all  but it’s there for sure. And if you have a well-tried mosquito remedy  bring it with you. We used Autan and it didn’t help. At all. Corfu is rich with midges (mini mosquitoes) that usually swarm out around sunset. And they’re merciless. Also worthy of note: if you stand taller than 180cm or 5’9  you might struggle with the short bed frame. It’s wide enough for two  but your feet will definitely have to come to terms with the foot of the bed.  But all of the above mentioned shouldn’t keep you from booking this gem. If you need a timeout from the hasty everyday world  this is where you get it. We’re planning to come back next year for sure.  Big thank you to Axilleas for being such a sweet and helpful host and just a great person overall. Show more
576002487041317086,Bibiana August 2022 The little house is very beautifully located  directly by the beach and in a quiet area. There are only a few other houses close by and you can enjoy your stay completely undisturbed. The water is super clear and it is also a great spot for collecting shells and snorkeling. If you have a reantal car  you can also easily reach some supermarkets/stores or restaurants. Axilleas also showed us how to fish for razor shells  which we successfully did and then were able to cook for dinner. All in all  we would have loved to stay longer and would definitely recommend this accommodation for everyone who is looking for a quiet place to relax  enjoy the time by the sea and just forget about their daily routine.
576002487041317086,Charlotte August 2022 Axilleas' place was the highlight of our trip. The studio was perfect  and the beach was amazing. We drove to a few different beaches around Corfu but found the one just outside where we slept to be the best. We got there at night time and woke up to the most spectacular sunrise over the ocean that I have ever seen - felt like a dream! Axilleas and his friend welcomed us and were very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here.
576002487041317086,Yu August 2022 We stayed here for three days and we loved it so much. This is something really unique. It is in a quiet place  with the forest on one side and the sea on the other. It's so close to the sea that you can literally jump in and swim at any time. This beach is great for swimming  and it's your own piece of the sea! We enjoyed swimming at different times  watching the sunrise and sunset in the sea  and blowing the sea breeze in the porch. . . and watch the orange moonset! The room is also lovely. It has everything necessary. You can cook your own meals  order meals  or drive to eat nearby. Axilleas offered his own olive oil and wine! We made our nice salad. Anyway  we are so happy to find this place and hope to visit it again next year.
576002487041317086,Haddy July 2022 Wow wow wow! This place is like heaven on earth. We were given olive oil and wine that the host had made himself. As we checked in Axeillas was there catching mussels and he was so friendly and gave it to us  which went perfectly with our pasta that we prepared. He is also more than happy to show you how to catch them. The area is very quite  which is very relaxing. You also have access to basic things like towels  goggles  pool mattress  coffee tea  salt pepper sugar  things to prepare food to cook and even a wooden boat at your disposal. On another night we decided to grill some fresh fish  which was also very cozy with the private beach and amazing views of mountains. We will never forget our stay in this place  it was nothing but wonderful!!! Thank you Axeillas for providing us a lifetime memory and the best Airbnb ever.
576002487041317086,Lejla July 2022 We can just confirm the other reviews and say when you are there it is even better than described and expected. Axilleas is a great host. He welcomed us with fruits  self made olive oil and wine. He even picked us ip  because we could not find the right turn to the cottage. The cottage is recently renovated  its well equipped with everything you need and perfectly located directly at the beach. The mornings and evenings there are amazing and our daughter loved playing with the dog. We loved staying at this airbnb!
576002487041317086,Robert July 2022 Axilleas is an excellent host and We had great time in his beach-house. Its a very quiet place  little paradise right at the beach with everything you need for relaxing vacation. If you are planning to visit some tourist attractions or public beaches of Corfu  be sure to plan your trips in advance with some schedule  otherwise you might just feel like staying around the house all the time  which is the best in the end.
576002487041317086,Sandra June 2022 Very nice place  a little paradise in Corfù !
576002487041317086,Xenia June 2022 it's a paradise! if you are looking for peace and want to be away from tourism  the small house by the sea is perfect! the sea is right on your doorstep and crystal clear. achilles is super friendly and nice and provided us with fresh fish and vegetables every day. we would definitely come back!
576002487041317086,Owen June 2022 Possibly the best Airbnb we’ve ever found! An amazing property in a truly fantastic location. Axilleas is a great host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Highly recommended and will be staying again soon!
576002487041317086,Josina June 2022 Axilleas house is like paradise on earth! We were welcomed by him and his cousin who showed us all we needed to know about the house and the area around it which was so helpful. The house is  exactly like in the pictures  right on the beach and we spend most of our time on the beautiful terrace overlooking the sea. The sandy beach has very shallow water which is great for long peaceful walks and catching mussels (which Axilleas was so nice to show me how to). We have enjoyed the beautiful sunsets  falling asleep with the waves in the background and the privacy that this airbnb provides. Axilleas is such a wonderful host and always surprised us with local specialties like local fruits or fresh fish that he caught. Lefkimmi is a beautiful sleepy town and there is tons of small beaches you can visit in the area. Having some way of transportation  a car or bike  would be best to explore the area.  We would recommend Axilleas Airbnb to anyone who is looking for a peaceful getaway! We'll come back next year!
576002487041317086,Maria November 2022 Dear Acxilleas  We enjoyed the time at your place very much. The house is so cute  the view amazing and the sweet animals that come to visit every morning made us wake up.   Thank you for your warmth  fruits  delicious olive oil and homemade wine.

576002487041317086,Rémi November 2022 Axilleas is a welcoming  simple and respectful person.  We were amazed by the place which is just a short walk from the sea. The property is well equipped and maintained.  If you're looking for peace  this is the place.  There are also some cats and a dog that may visit you 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
576002487041317086,Meike October 2022 We can only agree with the good reviews. We stayed at Axilleas' place for 4 days at the end of our Corfu holiday and it was the perfect ending. The small house is wonderfully simple  perfect for couples (as a large room) but really equipped with everything you need  now there is also a gas stove and a covered terrace  which is currently not yet visible in the photos. We ate there in the morning and evening and enjoyed the sea and sunsets. There are basic things for cooking: spices  pasta  oil  coffee  tea  honey  drinking water  fruit  own vegetables  wine and olive oil. Mosquito coils  sunscreen and shower gel and shampoo were also available. Axilleas is super nice and relaxed  he does his thing and is happy to help if necessary. He even gave us a squid from his catch. There is good company due to the friendly  trusty dog and the small and large cats  but they always stay outside. Two large supermarkets are 10 minutes away  otherwise Molos is very quiet in the off-session  which we enjoyed very much. Axillea's studio is really a wonderful place to switch off and relax  Axilleas is a great host  I hope we could come back sometime and that the place keeps its magic!

576002487041317086,Christiane September 2022 The studio is well equipped and the place just fantastic. Quiet  stunning scenery  the sound of the waves and changing colors offer such relaxing moments. Swimming is very pleasant. Thank you Axilleas. Translated from French  Show original

576002487041317086,Silvia September 2022 A little paradise - this proposal is our ideal beach vacation: quiet  directly on the beach  very nice and curated by the owner. Spacious and comfortable space  simple  but with all the necessary comfort  we were welcomed by Axilleas and his friends with simplicity and warmth; we appreciated their products   offered with spontaneity and courtesy: oil  wine and fish caught on sight  in addition to the charming place  which allowed us to spend 15 days of absolute peace and well-being  surrounded by the sea roll and the summer wind and to walk inside the wonderful forest of ancient olive trees and cypress trees  which surrounds the house inland. In the immediate vicinity is the excellent Petrakis Taverna  which in addition to the local food  also offers a beautiful equipped beach and several pleasant and quiet places: Lefkimmi  along the river  with a choice of typical restaurants and shops  and Kavos  on the west side  more touristy  in addition to the beautiful beach of Arkoudilas Highly recommended!

576002487041317086,Pierre July 2022 I was shared between the desire to keep this Paradise's address secret and share my enthusiasm to others  at the risk of not being able to return  as this rental is likely to be taken over quickly. To keep it brief  and to paraphrase some other reviews  we have the ultimate Airbnb! Quiet  secluded in a beautiful forest  but shops are still within walking distance  if you like to walk a little  and the sea view is idyllic. Axilleas  the owner  stays discreet during the few moments of daily presence  but full of small touches (thank you again for the tasting of sea knives from the last night!). A big thank you also for picking us up when we arrived and bringing us back to the village on the last day in her pickup! The fisherman's house is very well equipped  everything is there  even valuable masks for diving! We will surely come back very soon  if this Paradise is not taken over and therefore made inaccessible! It was a dream vacation for both of us! Thanks again to Axilleas!

576002487041317086,Malte June 2022 Axilleas' apartment is absolutely unique. It is a quiet place in the middle of a beautiful forest and right on a secluded beach with turquoise water. The sound of the waves accompanies you to sleep and wakes you up in the morning. If you open the door  you have to walk two steps and stand in the water. The apartment was excellently equipped and Axilleas has been an exceptional host who has accommodated an earlier check-in than usual  provided homemade wine and even offered a transfer to the next connected places. I've never experienced such hospitality before. I highly recommend staying at this place and would like to come back myself  best regards to Axilleas! Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Thorsten May 2022 This was the highlight of our Corfu trip for us! I would even say our Airbnb highlight so far. A unique place to stay with unique impressions that we will never forget. The sea noise  the clear water on the shallow beach  the sunset and and and...if you are looking for peace and seclusion  you will find your place here. Unique!!! That's all I want to give away at this point  everyone has to experience this for themselves:) In my opinion  you should have a car  quad or the like for self-sufficiency  as the supermarket is about 2.7 km away. It is about 2.0 km to the nearest tavern. We definitely want to go there again. Axilleas is a lovely and great host who gave us so much impressions  simply indescribable:) Great  great  great...!!! Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Robert May 2022 We were warmly welcomed by the two brothers. The house is fantastically located directly on the beach and you can fall into the water from the bed:) and you are rocked into sleep from the sea. The old house has been completely newly renovated but kept its charm. We especially liked the open fireplace. We also liked the location  the garden and the secluded beach also very much. The swimming facilities are great it goes into the water very shallow and you can harvest mussels if you know how to do it. We enjoyed walks in the vicinity. We would like to book this accommodation again  on our next stay in Corfu. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Linda September 2022 We stayed at Kiriakos’s place at Glyfada. We loved the views. He left us coffee for the morning which was a nice touch. If his place would have been available we would have stayed longer! I highly recommend Kiriakos’s place for your stay on Corfu Island.
6224037,Innokentiy August 2022 Great communication  incredible view. Spectacular apartment . Highly recommended
6224037,Gordana August 2022 We had great stay at Kiriakos apartment. The balcony view was amazing. Kitchen was well equipped. Just few minutes walk from the lovely beach. Wi-Fi was working perfectly. Great hospitality from Kiriakos  he greated us with tasty home made red wine and few fresh home eggs for our liitle daughter :) Thank you!
6224037,Georgina July 2022 We had a lovely week staying here. The balcony view is priceless and it was so nice to be able to hear the sea. As others have mentioned  you can also hear the beach bar but it wasn’t loud and on the one evening it was louder the kids enjoyed dancing along. The apartment is really clean and well equipped and as a family of four it was fine with the one bedroom. It’s a short walk to the beach and with two young kids we spent most of the time at the right side of the beach as the water is super shallow  little or no waves and it’s only sand in and out the water. Perfect! We also found a nice taverna with a pool which the kids used almost everyday. The Green Bus runs in the summer and we took a lovely evening trip to Corfu Town for the price of 6 euros! Kiriakos was friendly and helpful including organizing our luggage storage when we had a long wait for our flights home.
6224037,Arbri July 2022 Amazing host. Answered any questions we had very quickly. The apartment is very clean and in a great location. It's a short walk from the beach with a great sea view!

6224037,Angelica May 2022 Very nice apartment in a great area  close to many beaches. Kiriakos and his dad have been kind and helpful with us. The flat has a super view  priceless! We had a great stay - I definitely suggest this place to everyone!
6224037,Sándor April 2022 The view is amazing  just like in the photos. The kitchen is well-equipped. Glyfada is a secret calm place and you can easily reach every part of the island by car in 30 minutes. Highly reccomended.
6224037,Maya April 2022 Incredible view! The apartment has everything you need for your stay. In the off season you have the beach just for yourself! The host gave us a tasty self made wine as a welcome gift
6224037,Olesya October 2021 Wonderful stay at the apartment! Kiriakos was welcoming and kindly explained how everything works. Very convenient if you have a car as there is a dedicated parking spot with gates. The apartment is quite (we stayed in the end of October) and you can hear the sea from the bedroom. Plus  great sunsets from the balcony. Would totally recommend!
6224037,Antonia September 2021 Very nice Appartement on the seaside. As the restaurants are all rated rather poorly  we decided to cook for ourselves which is a pleasure in this Appartement. Everything you need is there and the terrace gives a stunning view.
6224037,Selena September 2021 👍
6224037,Snjezana August 2021 Hristos (Kiriakos‘ dad) was really helpful. Picked me up  drove me back  left wine in the apartment and provided tips. You can hear the sea waves at night in the apartment when it‘s calm. So relaxing. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
6224037,Gregor August 2021 A very nice apartment with a great view! 3min walk down the hill to the beach. Great sand beach. Sun shades available at the balcony  which are totally necessary!  There’s is only one con: - the Beach Club pazuzu is playing music the whole day (august) which is a little bit annoying - there is no real supermarket- they are just small and super expensive  so you need to rent a car to get to a normal priced supermarket  Overall we recommend a stay at this apartment! It’s a lovely place to be!
6224037,Tine July 2021 Very happy with our stay in this little paradise. The beach is next to the apartment and very kids friendly. Most amazing view from the balcony and many things to do and explore in the area. We will defiantly come back!
6224037,Lydmila July 2021 Excellent location and great view from the balcony. Kiriakos was always available and ready to help. Twice during our stay was the apartment cleaned and the clothes changed.
6224037,Karel June 2021 Nice and simple apartment close to the beach. Perfect communication with host.
6224037,Angela May 2021 Great location on a long sandy beach  perfect views from the balcony. The appartement is located in a lovely resort  but there is no village closeby. The appartement is as shown on the pictures. We had a magnificent time in kiriakos appartement.
6224037,Thomas November 2020 Very nice place with everything you need in an amazing location right on the beach!

6224037,Sophie August 2020 Thank you
6224037,Janeta August 2020 Very nice and clean apartment with a spectacular view over the sandy Glyfada beach. It`s located in Menigos resort - gated community with free parking. Kiriakos and his family were very nice  polite and easy to reach and communicate with. If you want to visit the villages near by  to shop or to explore the island a car is a must. The only minus is that there is no washing machine  which is a problem for longer stays. Thank you for everything!
6224037,Kyzzhibek August 2020 Nice and tidy apartment  ideal for 2-3 people  basic but decent equipment. The view from the balcony is spectacular! The host is very nice and helpful. The beach is 2-3 minutes walk.
6224037,Yalda February 2020 Kiriako's place was really nice. Just by the water  we ran on the beach in the mornings  and there was a nice private beach close by as well. The kitchen is equipped so we could cook. They have a private parking lot so it was very convenient to park our car. Overall everything was great.
6224037,Marianna July 2019 The host canceled this reservation 356 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6224037,Wojciech July 2019 Lovely place.worth recommendation.
6224037,Anita May 2019 It was the second time we chose this apartment. And we are still in love with it. :) the apartment is just perfect as it is. We had everything we needed  even more. The communication was always fast  easy and kind  the whole apartment was very clean and comfortable. We got a surprise gift for Easter :) and loved it :) in our last phone conversation I said thank you but I say it once more  thanks for everything  we had a perfect time♥️
6224037,Hubert April 2019 Location is an uniqueness of this place - beautiful sandy beach and stunning view of the half rocky  half green hills descending to the blue waters. We were able to taste extraordinary Greek nature but the sea in particular being not disturbed by the crowds as it was still out of the season. The apartment is what you ask for the money  basic but cosy  rather recommend for a couple than full family. I'd definitely recommend it and consider to come back some time in the future.
6224037,Tony March 2019 Our stay in Glyfada at Kiriakos’ place was unique in ways more than one; mainly because of the time of the year that we chose to be (early March). We had Glyfada beach to ourselves  or at least as much as our eyes could see. It’s just a 2min walk down the pathway/stairs to the beach from the apartment. View from the balcony is amazing. House was clean and well equipped. Can’t comment on how it is during the summers  but we definitely enjoyed the solitude this time of year. So if you’re coming during the low season  remember to get all the ‘supermarket stuff’ on your way there. Kiriakos’ father was kind enough to give us a ride to our next stop- Acharavi (for quite a reasonable charge).
6224037,Veselina January 2019 The balcony view is unafirgettable! The most pleasant place where I can hear only the sea waves and see endless sea horizons! Our host Kiriakos was very kind and was always ready to help us. Glyfada is very beautiful and green village and our apartment was just perfect for my family to have a wonderful holiday. It is sutuated in just a few steps away from the beach!
6224037,Christopher October 2018 We had a perfect time in Kiriakos Appartement!
6224037,Nasirai September 2018 Apartmentequipt as descriped. Beautiful balkony. Nice view. No mounting for the showerhead. Check in welcome was not the best.
6224037,Desislava September 2018 The view is just the best! Having your breakfast at this balcony with the awakening sun on Glyfada beach makes your stay unforgettable! Very nice and sweet place! It is very well equipped - the host has thought for everything  even coffee and anti mosquito device. The host waited us close to Corfu town and has guide us to the place even though we arrived a little bit late. Thank you very much! Perfect place for vacation!
6224037,Peter August 2018 Very nice place. Same as described. Flat is situated in Menigos Resort. Nice view on the beach. Quiet place. We enjoyed sunrise and sunset from the balcony. Near are small shops with everything you need but for higher prices. Beach is sandy and clean  without algaes  you can go in to the sea 50 meters and water is still not very deep. Kiriakos answers fast and was prepared to help all the time. I recommend this Kiriakos`s place.
6224037,Anastasia August 2018 The flat has a very nice view and it is 2-3 minutes far from the beach. It is fully equipped for a family with a baby ( a baby bed and chair was provided).
6224037,Carol June 2018 Great place in the Menigos resort. Though it is high up in the hills  the views are fantastic. The place was very clean and had a wonderful balcony. Nice bedroom and bathroom. Enjoy Glyfada in this beautiful apartment.
6224037,Milda May 2018 The apartment was lovely with better views out of the balcony than the pictures. We enjoyed our stay in the apartment and the beach was fantastic. We came during low season in Mid-May when there were not too many people so it was very peaceful. The water is crystal clear and the apartment is well decorated. We were greeted with fresh flowers and homemade wine. I hope to return here soon!
6224037,Marek May 2018 The place is really nice. The apartment is situated in the small village. It’s really close to the beach (5min walk) which is very beautiful. Some say it’s one of the best at Corfu. The only disadvantage is that it’s hard to get anywhere without a car. The closest village it’s about 2h walk. But if you just want to enjoy the beach or you rented a car I think it’s perfect place. We’ll definitely come back.
6224037,Marloes April 2018 Beautiful location and a clean house. Also the hospitality of the host was amazing! We were out of season  so in Glyfada were a lot of things closed. But with a car you can see everything and it is nowhere too busy!
6224037,Anita April 2018 The house was awesome with beautiful view  we had everything we needed. The beach is also beautiful and it's really close to the apartment. Kiriakos and his father were both really kind and helpful. :) It was not my first time on the island but it was the best accommodation where I've spent my time. :) I can just highly recommend for a perfect stay :) (for shopping and traveling around the island - especially before and after the summer season - a car needed but to have a relaxing week on the sandy beach  perfect without it :))
6224037,Tamas April 2018 Perfect location with fantastic view from the terrace to the see!! Communication was very easy. We got everything we needed for our stay including coffee  sugar  salt  juice  and also a bottle of good wine!! Thank you! We had a very nice stay in the apartment!
6224037,Sanne October 2017 Lovely apartment  in good condition  beautiful sea view and really quiet. Nice place to stay with two kids. The only problem we experienced in october  was dat the holiday season was over  so all the supermarkets  beach bar/ restaurants in Glyfada were closed.
6224037,Melanie September 2017 We spent a realy good time in Kiriakos' flat. The vew from the balcony is just wonderfull ! The appartment is clean and well equiped. You can access to everything on walk (supermarket  restaurant  beach). We met his father  he is realy great person ! ;-) We hightly recommand this flat.
6224037,Dafinka August 2017 Wide sandy beach and crystal clear water of the Ionian Sea plus the great hospitality of Kiriakos and his father makes Glyfada beach magical place for your summer holidays.The apartment is just a few minutes walk to the beach  very clean  equipped with everything you need to feel like home. The view is breathtaking!
6224037,Elize July 2017 Great stay! Amazing location  close to the beach  market  restaurants. We went with our 10 month old and it was very easy and manageable. Would definitely stay here again.
6224037,Jana June 2017 We enjoyed our time in Kyriakos's apartment. He and his father are very friendly and helpful. The apartment is very nice (like on the pictures) and close to a beautiful sandy beach. The view from the terrace was stunning too! We will recommend to anyone travelling to Corfu.
6224037,Dobril June 2017 Great place to stay may be even with two kids. Close enough to the wonderful beach. The host has made all the effort to provide a comfortable and unique accommodation. Personal touch in every detail helps. Gated community - safe and pleasantly quiet. Beautiful see view. We would gladly stay there again.
6224037,Kevin May 2017 Lovely location right on the sandy beach. (Many beaches in Corfu are stoney) Location is quiet area  away from tourist center (good for us) Rental car is needed.  Apartment is clean and comfortable  in good location with private parking. South facing balcony with great views of the beach and coastal scenery. Comfortable bed with airco. Furniture is basic but totally functional. Good value for the price (we paid around 50 euro a night)  Wifi was good enough  worked most of the time  a few blackouts for a few hours. Fast enough to stream Spotify but not Netflix in our experience.  Only suggestion is to improve some of the kitchen equipment. The pans are hardly usable  and lacking knives and chopping boards. (We had to buy our own knife which we left in the apartment) Also a basic stock of some kitchen fundamentals is expected: salt/pepper  oil  sugar etc.   Show more
6224037,Laurent & Kathleen April 2017 Fantastic place with a wonderful view ! Kiriakos was very flexible about our arrival et departure time.
6224037,Ali April 2017 A very pleasant stay. Great beachside location. Excellent communication with Kiriakos throughout.
6224037,Emily April 2017 We had a great time staying in Kiriakos' apartment it was very clean and the view from the apartment was beautiful. Great location  beautiful beach and very easy to explore other beaches and the town from Glyfalda. Thank you so much:)
6224037,Hugh October 2016 A lovely place. Very peaceful just out of season.
6224037,Aliyah October 2016 We had a lovely time in Glyfada  we only stayed for two nights as it was part of a longer trip in Corfu and Albania  but would definitely like to come back and stay for longer. There were four of us staying in the apartment and there was plenty of space to accommodate us all. It was lovely inside with a great balcony and only a few steps to the beach. The beach was beautiful and there were plenty of bars and restaurants. If you are self catering it pays to be organised and stock up on food before you arrive in Glyfada as there aren't many food shopping options in the resort. Kirakos and his dad were incredibly helpful  providing us with all the information that we needed and arranging transport for us back to Corfu town on our last day. We ended up going for a big walk to Pelekas and had some delicious food on the beach and drinks in a taverna at the top of the hill in the town. Would highly recommend this trip and apartment!
6224037,Aleksandra September 2016 Everything was wonderful. The apartment is just like in the fotos. The hosts were very helpful  beach is right under  and it is great!
6224037,Christina September 2016 We have just returned from a lovely stay in this apartment. The views are wonderful  it was peaceful and very clean. The kitchen was very functional  the bed was large and comfortable and the apartment included all of the basic amenities you would expect. Kiriakos has been delightful to speak with and his father met us from our taxi to show us around the apartment and give us useful guidance on the local area which we really appreciated.  For those who have not been to Glyfada before  beware there are only 4 places you can eat in the resort (all within 5 minutes walk)  two of which are not great. If you want a wider selection  be prepared to take a bus to Corfu town or a taxi elsewhere. There are two small mini-marts which sell essentials but other than that  it is just a lovely beach with very calm  shallow water.  Overall  a very comfortable and enjoyable stay and we would love to return again!
6224037,James August 2016 Great spot - clean had all we needed for a nice 2 night stay
6224037,Anna August 2016 The apartment was great  big enough  very clean and close to the beach. Kiriakos answered me quickly and his mother helped us a lot when we arrived there  I totally recommend it!
6224037,Daniele July 2016 Kyriakos and his father Christos are very reliable and nice persons. The description of the house is exact and accurate. The house is really as it looks in the photos. The beach and the sea are wonderful. However the resort and the surroundings are very poor in terms of shops and restaurants (low quality and very expensive!). Moreover the wi-fi connection is very bad and should be improved  but probably this depends on the overall resort's network.
6224037,Hollie July 2016 Loved our stay with Kiriakos. His father welcomed us and was very patient while we got lost and took a bit of time to find him. He showed us everything and had great instructions. We were very close to the water  which made it so easy to take our little girl. The AC worked amazing and we did not have to worry about the heat. One of the best things was the soundproofing which is so important if you have a little one. Apparently there was a large celebration (this only happens once a year we were told) on the beach  but we had no idea this was happening until we walked outside. We couldn't hear the music from the beach until you walked outside  but even then it was not at all bothersome. We would definitely stay here again. Very clean  great hosts  and family friendly!
6224037,Pamfili July 2016 Kiriakos and his father were perfect hosts. Very easy to reach and eager to make sure everything is going well for their guests. The flat has a beautiful view  was very cleaning and provided for everything you need  including Coffee and Juice and Kiriakos father's homemade wine (thank you again!). The resort was very quiet and the sea very beautiful  so perfect if you're looking for something quiet in corfu. There is a very beautiful Mountain village nearby that has a few restaurants and bars and even corfu town is only a 20 minutes drive away. I recommend warmly
6224037,Kerstin July 2016 We really appriciated the stay in this cute and nice flat. Especially the balkony with the sea view is just wonderful - we used to have breakfast and dinner there. Kiriakos as well as his father and mother were really helpful and kind with everything. We had a great time and missed nothing in this fully equipped place. The beach of the resort is really nice even if we recommend to rent a car and visit different beaches - there are a lot around. Furthermore  we suggest to buy the foodstuff in a supermarket outside which is a lot cheaper than in the resort. In summary it is a really nice place to stay and we felt really comfortable. Thanks a lot for the hospitality!
6224037,Deborah June 2016 Lovely little apartment  big enough for our purposes  very clean and tidy with everything we needed. Very nice balcony with sea views. Peaceful resort  just what we were looking for. It was wonderful to wake up and fall asleep to the sound of the sea. Shop a few minutes away. Sandy beach with umbrellas and sunbeds for 8 euros  also just a few minutes walk (down a very pretty little path full of flowers  with swifts flying overhead). Couple of tavernas right on the beach  a fabulous bar for evening cocktails and a super restaurant at one end of the beach. Just enough for a perfectly enjoyable and relaxing holiday. Kiriakos kindly helped with arranging airport transfers. Sheets and towels were changed and apartment cleaned during our stay. Problem with the drains on arrival but Kiriakos was very responsive and helpful and his father arrived with a plumber almost immediately. His father also brought us the most wonderful homemade wine and gave us a lift into Corfu Old Town one day. I would not hesitate to recommend both the apartment  our hosts and the resort and would happily return. Thank you very much!!
6224037,Richard May 2016 Fantastic appartment. Clean. Nice view from balcony. Close to the beach and restaurants  supermarket  greetings Richard and family
6224037,Callum May 2016 Kiriakos is very responsive and quick to offer assistance. He answered all our questions throughout our stay. The apartment is situated in a relatively remote holiday resort  which we weren't entirely expecting but otherwise enjoyed. The apartment was clean and very comfortable and overall we are delighted to recommend Kiriakos and this apartment.
6224037,Sarita May 2016 The house was better than in the pictures  the area was amazing relaxing and the views you need to be there just to imagine. The landlord was very nice! Hope to meet again!
6224037,Frank April 2016 Wonderful accomodation hosts father came late at night to greet me and was very friendly. Fantastic views spotlessly clean appartment. Beach looked clean and inviting.
6224037,Stefan September 2015 We enjoyed staying at Kiriakos place a lot. Glyfada was the perfect spot to explore this beautiful island or to relax at its wonderful beach. The apartment was as in the pictures and the environment quite and Kiriakos as host always reachable. Thank you and your family for these great holidays!
6224037,Saskia September 2015 It was absolutely a great place. In the apartment there was everything we needed. One of the things we loved was the sound of the sea. And ofcourse the view.
6224037,Elena September 2015 Nice and cosy apartment on a lovely beach! We really liked it and enjoyed our stay. Apartment is nice  just as you see it on the photos. Clean. Kitchen well equipped. Just few minutes walk from the lovely beach. Wi-Fi was working perfectly.  There is a bar on the beach and sometimes the music is loud but it doesn't happen all the time and never after 22h at night.  Lovely setting  nice villiges to go around  good location for exploring Corfu. I recommend it!  We would like to come back :-)
6224037,Tina August 2015 Kiriakos' apartment was perfect for our stay in Corfu. It was clean  well equipped and had an amazing view. The WiFi signal was strong and much appreciated. We loved that the kitchenette was so well equipped and that the apartment was furnished tastefully. We were lucky enough to find a bottle of homemade wine and fresh eggs in the refrigerator  both courtesy of Kiriakos' parents and their hens. Such lovely hosts  and the apartment was perfect. After visiting every coast in Corfu and many different beaches  we still felt that Glyfada beach was the best! The restaurant on the beach (near the rocks and private residence on the hill) was top notch and consistently good. I would highly recommend Kiriakos and his apartment.
6224037,Marija August 2015 The apartment looked exactly like in the photos. The location was perfect the beach with an amazingly blue sea and golden sand could be reached in 2 min by walking. The host was super friendly and helped us as much as he possibly could in all the situations. Everything was pretty much perfect and our holiday was unforgettable. The only minor disadvantage could be a really poor internet connection  but even that didn't ruin our stay because if needed you could always find proper internet connection down at the beach. Would recommend this place to everyone  especially if you're looking for a quiet getaway with a possibility to travel around Corfu as the apartment is located right in the middle of the island.
6224037,"Xabier August 2015 My wife and I originally intended to stay at Kiriakos' place during our 2 week honeymoon but we simply couldn't stay. The apartment was clean and as in the pictures. Kiriakos also kindly organized a Taxi to take us from the airport to Glyfada.  Upon arrival we were dropped off by the driver with a set of keys and nowhere was Kiriakos to explain anything about the apartment. Internet was not working and we couldn’t even find how to turn on the water heater to take shower. After sending a text message Kiriakos agreed to meet and explain a few things about the apartment.  One big problem is that internet doesn't work. In itself that's no problem  but here what is advertised as WIFI  and paid for  is not the apartment's WIFI but a resort wide internet which never worked.  Secondly  we have never encountered such a dishonest and misleading advertisement. Quoting directly the description:  ""between 14:00 to 17:00 you are in a lively atmosphere  after 18:00 you enjoy absolute tranquillity of the Mediterranean seaside.""  ""at post evening hrs you can only hear the sound of the waves.""  Well  every night you hear music until 9pm from the bar  so you can’t enjoy the ""absolute tranquility of the Mediterranean seaside"". Every Sunday there is a huge party which lasts longer and also on other nights (for us Monday  but after moving we saw that big parties were also held on Friday and Saturday too  it was advertised on posters all over town and on the bar's facebook page). Even if you close all the windows and doors you can still hear the music inside  therefore we couldn't even enjoy the terrace. If you enjoy listening to electronic music above the waves then it's ok  but when you look for a place defined for its absolute tranquility and hearing the seaside it is horrible.  The worse was Kiriakos  when we asked him about internet he said he would fix it with an alternative solution and then we didn’t read from him for 2 days. Considering the above points and not having any news we decided we had enough and would cancel our additional days to look for a different place to enjoy our honeymoon. Of course within minutes we are graced with news from Kiriakos who very passive aggressively demanded how we could dare cancel the days (flexible cancellation policy Kiriakos has chosen!). He blamed us for spending his money fixing WIFI and that it was ready to install if we could drop whatever we are doing to go meet him  even demanding us ""Where are you right now?"" and ""Where are you exactly?"" to talk. 2 days later internet was still not working (we see later guests still had the problem)  Overall the place is ok but we would urge Kiriakos to honestly describe the noise and WIFI so he can attract the right type of guests and also to learn how to treat people respectfully (being honest and reliable).

6224037,Dániel July 2015 Kiriakos and his whole family welcomed us replay warmly  his Dad even gave us some home made presents  such as melon  which was growing his own garden! The apartment is awesome  everything is as you can see on the pictures. Kitchen fully equipped  the whole apartment is extremely clean (they even cleaned the apartment during our longer stay)! Kiriakos even brought some fish for us  since we couldn't by fresh fish to cook ourselves nearby...! Thank you for that again! The beach is just perfect and it is about 2 minute walk from the apartment. The host even arranged us taxi from and to the airport! The whole island is precious and can be easily explored by renting a little car at the reception  where the apartment is located. If you are looking for a place in Corfu Island  Glyfada is the perfect beach and Kiriakos's apartment is just perfect. Greatly recommended!
6224037,Christian July 2015 My girlfriend and I stayed at Kiriakos's place for a week and we were made to feel very welcome. When we arrived we got a bit lost and Kiriakos made the effort of coming to meet us where we were and take us to the apartment. He even showed us round explaining how things worked.  The apartment itself is great and has everything you need for a short stay  but we were a little disappointed to find that it is actually on a resort as this wasn't mentioned in the listing. Menigos Resort is reasonably nice and has mainly families and couples  however  we would have preferred a more authentic Greek setting.  The best bit about the apartment has to be it's balcony that looks over Glyfada beach  this was one of the main selling points for us before we made our decision of where to stay. It is much bigger in real life compared to the pictures  however  it does look over a rather busy sun-bedded area which is not shown in the pictures. There is also music coming from the bar very close most evenings  but it is normally at a low volume other than on Sundays when they have a beach party.  The only other issue we had during our whole holiday was the fact that the resort wifi had extremely bad signal in the apartment. We would have to go out to the beach to get any wifi most days and this made it very hard to communicate with Kiriakos  receive and send some necessary work emails and also plan our day trips around the island.  Glyfada beach is in a beautiful location and is very sandy with crystal clear waters. When in Glyfada we spent most of our time towards the right hand side of the beach where it is a little calmer and has no music playing. The middle area is quite busy and definitely has a younger crowd. We were in Corfu to relax and so didn't go there much.  All in all we had a fantastic holiday and would definitely recommend Glyfada beach as a destination to visit  however  if we were to holiday in Corfu again we would probably not stay there as we prefer a more quiet  less touristy location.  Show more
6224037,Steven July 2015 Our stay in this flat in Glyfada was great. It's located right in the beach resort  a short walk to the beach. The view from the balcony is beautiful  looking right over the sea. The flat is perfect for a couple  or like us with a small child. The sandy beach has an ideal area at the end for small kids and families. There are a couple of good food options with one mini market with some fresh groceries. We'd definitely recommend the flat and the location. We look forward to our next trip to corfu!
6224037,Ash June 2015 Perfect location to enjoy Corfu! A stone throw away from the beach and close to Corfu town. The host was inviting and very helpful with recommendations!

6224037,Gabriele September 2022 A great holiday in Corfu on one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. The apartment is minutes from the beach with fantastic sea views. An ideal starting point for excursions. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Lukas September 2022 A lovely stay and great location on the beach! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Christos September 2022 Everything is fine. Good location on the beach. Kerkyra can be reached quickly. The streets of Corfu are just extremely poor. This has nothing to do with the listing. Very satisfied overall. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Isabelle August 2022 Very good stay in Kiriakos apartment. The sea view is breathtaking  the beach is beautiful  very lively during the day. Kiriakos is a thoughtful host. I would recommend this property. Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Tetyana August 2022 Host is very nice and friendly! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Florian June 2022 A really nice apartment with everything you need for small meals. Wonderful view from the balcony. Even in the high heat  you can tolerate it superbly there. An easy way to the beach is available  where back up is a bit more exhausting;-). The communication with Kiriakos was always given and quickly accessible for questions. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Paul October 2021 A beautiful small apartment with great views of the lake. The furnishings are a bit older but it is clean  cozy and finds everything you need. If you are looking for party or nightlife  you have to drive a little. There are a few bars and taverns  but unfortunately they were already closed at the end of September. However  if you just want to go on a beach vacation  it is ideal. In Pelekas there are a few very nice tavernas. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Andrea September 2021 Very nice place with a great view of the sea and easy access to the beach. Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Pascale September 2021 Very nice location  quiet. Charming apartment. We arrived late but welcomed without worries with 2 bottles of homemade wine and water in the fridge. On the other hand  the village is far from everything  it takes a car to visit the rest of the island. Convenience stores are very expensive but the owner is nothing. We recommend ! Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Julia September 2021 Beautiful apartment with fantastic views of the bay - the balcony is larger than expected and offers sun protection on all sides. The communication with Kiriako's father was very nice  we were even allowed to check out later and received a bottle of his wine as a gift! Great location for a beach vacation  but car is a must for further excursions and shopping (small mini markets on the beach offer everything but expensive) Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Nadine August 2021 It was very nice. However  we were a bit surprised by the other reviews  as the information about the surroundings is not quite right. You are quite cut off from the surrounding villages and you need a rental car if you want to get out of this bay. The bus only runs every hour and otherwise you can get anywhere by taxi  but is quite expensive. The supermarket is extremely expensive there and it is worthwhile to drive towards Corfu city to shop in a large supermarket. The 2 taverns that are there are also in the complex and are therefore expensive! So if you want to see something of the island...definitely organize a rental car. The beach  on the other hand  was one of the most beautiful we have visited. And the apartment was also okay. The bathroom does require renovation  but otherwise everything you need was there. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Majcol August 2021 it is a paradise both the sea view and the location of the house in the residence ..... kilometer beach with sand and the possibility of renting sun loungers or going to the free one you will not find large gatherings anyway. Highly recommended Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Paul June 2021 Very good stay in Corfu at Kiriakos apartment!  Check-in was smooth in the evening  around 11: 00 p.m. The apartment is good  but it can only accommodate up to 3 people. It is generally well-equipped  even if it was missing some items maybe (a large stove  garbage bags for example  deckchairs for the terrace). Nothing that has forced us to honestly.  Kiriakos' father came to change the towels for us in the middle of the stay  which is very nice.  The apartment was very clean. Air conditioning is a real plus.  Glyfada is a beautiful place. All of them were there in June  so there weren't many people. I imagine it must be a little less friendly in July/August. Proximity to the sea is a real plus (it takes 3 minutes to get to the beach). Fine sands on the beach and in the water.  The beachside beachside/restaurants are not amazing  but the views are nice.  For departure  Kiriakos and his family were very accommodating  so no problem with that.  I highly recommend this apartment and its owners ! Show more Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Ryan October 2020 We had a very great stay in Kiriakos's apartment. The contact and communication was very good and we could easily contact him with questions. The location is great  the beach great and the view from the balcony is simply beautiful. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Pascal August 2019 Cozy apartment with a great view of Glyfada Bay. Close to the beach and parking. Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Stine July 2019 Super lovely little apartment. Good location and beautiful area. We enjoyed the beach which is 5 min from the apartment. We stayed 2 adults and 2 kids (it went fine) You definitely need a car if you want to get around the area. The apartment was as pictured and we had a lovely stay. We highly recommend it. Translated from Danish  Show original
6224037,Marie-Chantal June 2019 The apartment is small but well appointed in the colors of Greece in blue and white. It's well located if you have a car. We highly recommend the Spiros 97 restaurant near Vatos. And the value for money is exceptional and the decor under a pergola of vines   very Mediterranean.

6224037,"Hanna June 2019 I loved staying with Kiriakos. Everything is well-organized. If you don't want to rent a car or take a bus  you can get help with cheap transportation. And Kiriakos was lovely all around. We came with our baby and he arranged us a crib and high chair  and even beach toys. The apartment has a terrace with beautiful views of the sea  the beach  and the ""green"" rocks. We don't like it when it's loud  so we choose off-season trips. We were recently in October (warm water and 27-28 degrees  now we were on the turn of May and June - a little colder). Recommended! Translated from Polish  Show original"
6224037,Anja October 2018 Kiriakos' apartment is so pretty and well divided and is in reality as seen in the photos. Plus a fantastic view of the bay and  if you look a little side  also of the sunset (we were there at the end of September/ early October  in summer this is probably different). The furnishings are sufficient but above all very cute and tasteful. The apartment is located in a complex  but which is very nicely laid out and very green. The individual houses and apartments are arranged offset from each other so that you are not very close to the neighbors and it was also quite quiet and pleasant. However  if the whole bay is fully booked in the height of summer  it could be different  as there are several restaurants on the beach in front of the complex  some of which were already closed. There are convenient mini-markets in the bars  but of course they are a bit more expensive than in Kerkyra. There is a reception service that has always helped with advice and action. And there are buses to Kerkyra and back several times a day  travel time about 45 min. Price 2.40€ Overall a nice place in a beautiful bay with beautiful clear sea and we would come back and can recommend the apartment. Show more Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Sebastian September 2018 Perfect for a few days of relaxing on the beach! The apartment has everything you need  even a small parasol for the beach was included (and also necessary). Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Александр August 2018 Very kind and attentive host  excellent location of the house both in the complex of the apartment and on the island. This is probably the best beach on the island. A limited number of shops and restaurants around. Everything is fine inside and matches the photos  but for a vacation with children it is necessary to understand that there is no washing machine and microwave. Translated from Russian  Show original
6224037,Enrico June 2018 The apartment is located on one of the most beautiful sandy beaches on the island. Obviously you need a car to get around and even do some basic shopping. In my opinion  it is not suitable for a family larger than two people  although since there is a sofa bed  there may also be a child. But the size is very small. The residence is very nice and quiet (at least in June). Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Hanna October 2017 Kiriakosa's apartment was a lovely place to stay. The terrace gave us views of the beach and the sea. Going to the beach was convenient. The apartment was quiet (we were in the off-season) and the decor was nice  fresh for the eyes  and had lots of space for our things. Because it was the low season  the shops were closed and it was nice that there was a bus (the GreenBuses) from Glifada to the city of Corfu (almost 1 hour 2/3 buses a day  stop near the hotel). It's a really nice place to unwind during the off-season. It also has very good wifi. Translated from Polish  Show original
6224037,"Otto September 2017 Kiriakos' apartment was a real happiness for us and significantly participated in the success of our first project ""2 weeks beach holiday"". The apartment is located in a lovingly designed  quiet and very well maintained holiday home settlement with winding streets and paths. The photos describe the apartment perfectly  but they do not give away the indescribably beautiful view of the bay - especially in the evening sun. We never knew whether it was nicer on the beach or at the evening beer on the balcony.  The apartment is friendly and thoughtfully equipped. Unlike many apartments in the neighborhood  great awnings are installed on all sides of the balcony  so you can protect yourself from too much sunlight if needed. The kitchen is tricky  so it is not overcrowded and we were able to prepare everything the market in Corfu city so wonderfully. There is no microwave  but instead a super stove with ceramic hob and oven. The communication with Kiriakos  his dad and his mom was always very spontaneous and informative (personal/email/mobile).  We can't wait to spend a wonderful holiday in Kiriakos' apartment again! Show more Translated from German  Show original"
6224037,Eldar September 2017 After other hotels on Corfu island  this one seemed very even good. The apartment is located in the Menigos condominium  among many similar houses. The apartment is on some elevation and this is a plus because it was damp in the morning (August). It is not difficult to get up to the house  even with children  but it will take a few minutes. Without a doubt you might need a car. Parking is available (located downstairs) and it has a personal space. A convenience store with some groceries (not very large) is available on the territory of the condominium. As for the apartment itself. It's okay. Clean. Some tiles are broken  the tap in the kitchen is a little old  etc. Well  all the little things are of course shabby  but this does not distract at all from the fact that it is spacious  cool in the heat  light spaces in which only the sea surf can be heard. And the view of the sea and the horizon  which opens from the loggia  covers all shortcomings. There (on the loggia) you can have breakfast  lunch and dinner quite comfortably  because the apartments have everything for such comfort. Keep in mind  however  that in Corfu  you may find wasps in the dining spots. They are here. Flying to eat. You can easily lose their interest if you add incense to your lunch. Overall we enjoyed the place and would recommend it to my friends. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original

6224037,Tatiana June 2017 Stayed as a family with a child of 7 years in an apartment in Glyfada. All of the information posted on the site is consistent. The apartment is within walking distance from the beach  as well as the bus stop. The view from the balcony to the sea is magnificent! At night you can hear the surf  during the day you can watch the bat of swallows. Reconnecting with nature!))) Satellite TV shows the main channels in different languages  but they are not necessary when there is such a beauty around! Transparent sea  sandy beach  fish. The kitchen is well equipped  I used the oven actively - works great! The apartment is clean and bright  has everything you need  even an insect picker. The grounds are well landscaped  there are showers to rinse off from the sand after the sea. Kyriakos  thank you to you and your mom for a comfortable stay in the apartment! We would love to come back to Greece again. Translated from Russian  Show original
6224037,Mark August 2016 Kiriakos' apartment was great: clean  bright and equipped with all the necessary things. The communication with Kiriakos was flawless  he responded very quickly and was very helpful. He organized taxi for us and also came as soon as we called him once. His mother cleaned our apartment after five days and changed the bed linen and towels. When we arrived  wine and juice were available in the fridge. We were very happy to accept it. We would book the apartment again! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Laura June 2016 The apartment looked exactly like the pictures. Great view of the beach from the balcony. Beautifully furnished apartment with all comforts. This location is always recommended. Everything worked out great with Kiriakos and his father. We will be happy to come back. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,"Peggy November 2015 The accommodation is as shown in the photos: well arranged  beautiful view  and clean (towels and shower products provided  as well as dishwashing products). On the other hand  we stayed there the last week of October  the season was over and nothing was open: no convenience store or restaurant... The advantage  we had the beach for us! Nice hikes to do around too. For us who love tranquility  I don't know if it would have suited us in the middle of the season because there is no soundproofing. And located at the top of the residence  the return from the beach can be ""difficult"" with little ones. Translated from French  Show original"
6224037,Bea October 2015 I stayed at Kiriakos's apartment in Glyfada with my family (two kids aged 4 and 7 and my partner) for a week. The apartment is part of a settlement of similar apartments  is close to the sea and you have a great view. The apartment is extremely practically furnished and you really have everything you need. Kiriakos and his father welcomed us very warmly (with their own wine) and answered any question within the shortest possible time. Kiriakos also sent a taxi driver to the airport who took us to Glyfada and explained everything. We had a great week  especially eating in the restaurants and shops of the Glyfada Bay and bathing in the crystal clear sea. I highly recommend Glyfada especially in the fall and Kiriakos as a host is a good luck! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Laurence September 2015 WE realy appreciate our stay in kiriakos' flat. The flat is like the pictures. The apartment is very well equipped  comfortable and quiet. It comes with everything.

591663219903205010,Margaret November 2022 Quite a large resort  we were travelling out of season  so mainly closed  but think it’s good in main season. You should have quite good mobility.
591663219903205010,Josephine October 2022 The location is very good. You walk to the beach in 1 min  it’s only down a few stairs. The terrace is nice to sit at. Do keep in mind though  that if you’re allergic to cats  it might not be for you  since there are roaming cats sneaking onto the cushions. The apartment is rather small but enough. The kitchen is sparsely equipped but doable for some easy meals. If you’re traveling off season you will definitely need it though (same as a car!!!) since the restaurants and supermarket in the village are closed. The bathroom is very musty since the ventilation hood doesn’t work well  but if you air it out it’s ok. Both hosts are really nice and even provide you with many recommendations (: Overall a nice stay in corfu!
591663219903205010,Soléman July 2022 Great house  great host  great beach In one word : perfect
591663219903205010,Hugo July 2022 Maria and Stavros' apartment is like described. A little gem  a few steps from an amazing beach. It is a little bit old  but well keep. Maria and Stavros are very communicative and promptly to help us. We had a problem that was repaired in a few hours. A top notch reaction.
591663219903205010,Will June 2022 Amazing place right by the beach  everything you need for a lovely stay in Corfu :)
591663219903205010,Julia May 2022 We had a great time here. The apartment is exactly like in the pictures and really cozy with beautiful view. Maria and Stavros were wonderful. They picked us up from the main gate of the resorts and it was no problem  that our flight was delayed. It was always possible to contact Maria and she even gave us some really good recommendations for corfu. Glyfada beach is beautiful but you really need a car here. Only thing that was different than expected is  that the neighbor of the apartment is the owner of it. And they sometimes had to go through our garden to get to their apartment. So it wasnt as privat as expected  but for us it was no problem. Overall we can highly recommend to stay here!
591663219903205010,Anne-Sophie May 2022 We had a great time in Glifada. Maria met us at the main gate and showed us the house. The apartment itself was exactly as described and had a wonderful ocean view. We really enjoyed the garden and terrace. The kitchen was fully equipped (there were basic amenities like oil and spices) and we even had a second terrace next to the sleeping room. The ocean with a nice sand beach is maybe 15 meters from the apartment. We had a designated parking spot  so there was no need to worry about the car. A mini supermarket and restaurants are in walking distance. We really enjoyed the stay!
591663219903205010,Lyle May 2022 This is a nice  cozy apartment with a lovely garden and great view. Good decor and furnishings. Easy and short access to the beach. We loved sitting on the terrace enjoying the garden and sea veiw. The host was excellent and we would definitely return!
591663219903205010,Natasha May 2022 Glyfada beach is hand's down the best beach we visited in our lovely time in Corfu. Staying at Maria's was a treat  simple  tidy and lovely details in the place. She gave us a really friendly check-in and when our flight home was delayed was gracious to let us enjoy the beach a little longer. I would strongly recommend staying at Ionian Senses!
591663219903205010,Nicolas April 2022 Great location great hosts. I would 10/10 return and recommend
591663219903205010,Colleen April 2022 Great little apartment with all of the basics you will need. It’s located steps away from the beach and the apartment is positioned in a way that it has a great view but it’s also very private. It is located 30 minutes driving from the old town of Corfu but we loved the idea of having a relaxing peaceful place to go after the busyness of being a tourist. Maria is very responsive  fantastic!
591663219903205010,Firdaws April 2022 Maria was a great host. She made sure we had everything we needed. The place was beautiful and a few steps to the beach. Book this place if you want a relaxing time away! You won't be disappointed. We enjoyed the beach and the hikes. The location was beautiful.
591663219903205010,Ricarda October 2022 We stayed at Maria and Stavros Airbnb towards the end of the season (October) and had a great time! The apartment is perfectly located to explore the island with a rental car  because every corner is wonderful to reach as a day trip. The nearby village of Pelekas is also really nice and offers a few nice places to eat in the evening. The hospitality of Maria and Stavros was really great! Every question was answered promptly. We would definitely recommend staying here! Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Nora October 2022 The stay with Maria and Stavros was absolutely outstanding! The location  right on the sea  is simply fantastic - the apartment is exactly as described. Maria is a great host  communication was excellent in advance and also during the stay. Even with a small water damage in the bathroom  she was on site in less than 1 hour with a handyman. In addition  she has provided us with her best island recommendations  which I can also recommend ;). Ionian Senses is definitely worth the trip! Thank you :) Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Max September 2022 Maria and her husband are pleasant and responsive hosts.  For the property  the property is located a little further from the waterfront than the photos suggest.  Neighbors must walk through the garden to access their accommodation (specified in the listing now) but photos are not representative. This reduces the expected privacy of the property.  Half of the stay was a problem with the hot water  but the hosts were responsive to address it.  The place is amazing  actually one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. As mentioned in many reviews and in the listing  it is best to rent a car. Translated from French  Show original

591663219903205010,Horst June 2022 Super nice hosts who take care of you! There are only a few steps to the beach with the super nice clean crystal clear sea ideal for snorkeling! For the sunset you have to choose another point  there are many beautiful places nearby!! The accommodation is in a great location  provides shade . .. You should adjust to two things: you are in a complex with many houses  the neighbor is left and right and up right next to you . . It is quite quiet there. . Yes and from 23 degrees the cicadas go to the alarm clock  you get used to it ;-)) or try to distribute it. . And the story with the air conditioners . . There are always people who overdo it  we were three days passing through here at 35 degrees and turned them on for 20 minutes in the evening  thanks to the constant breeze it was for sleeping OK. Thank you Maria+ Stavros😎 Translated from German  Show original

38667437,Katharina October 2022 The appartment is really beautiful with an amazing view from the balcony. It was really tidy and clean and we could feel at home right away. We loved our stay there and Effie is an especially great host. She was super friendly and communicative and she even found a solution for us as we had problems renting a car. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that wants to visit corfu!
38667437,Lihi September 2022 We had an amazing stay at Effie's apartment in the lovely village of Pentati. 1. Apartment - spacious enough for 5 people and designed very nicely. A home away from home with a gorgeous view from the balcony. Kitchen is fully equipped and we cooked a lot. 2. Location - perfect for exploring the whole island and getting to the best beaches. 3. Effie - the best host ever! Caring  nice and answers immediately to any question or request. In summary: we highly recommend. 5 stars :)
38667437,Martynas (Marty) September 2022 amazing property with all the things you may need. the views are astonishing and the host is super responsive  friendly and just overall awesome. The location is a very charming village - however  if you're not used to driving in mountain roads  take it slow!
38667437,Anna August 2022 Perfect apartment in a perfect location. Effie was a fantastic host who did everything possible to make sure we had a great stay. Thank you!
38667437,Loredana August 2022 Effie was an awesome host and she helped us with everything we needed. She was very responsive and very kind the whole time. The view from Effie’s place is so pretty. There is also a bus station very close to Effie’s place but it is better and easier to rent a car. Effie helped us to rent a car and so we could visit a lot more from the beautiful Corfu island.
38667437,Brad July 2022 What an amazing view! This place is a vacation in itself just hanging out on the deck and walking down to the little village for an authentic Greek taverna experience. Host met me on-site and was extremely helpful  communicative and friendly.

There is a good parking spot  quiet location  unbeatable view  friendly neighbors  well appointed apartment with everything we needed. Thank you Effie  we hope to return in the future!

38667437,Sammy July 2022 Such a stunning apartment in the mountains of Pentati! There was 2 local shops (5 min walk) which sold everything you need and 2 gorgeous roof top resultants/bar also within less than 5 minutes  would recommend renting a moped to go to other beaches as they are maybe an hour walk but we walked and was a lovely walk  but there is a beach vertically down from the apartment and it’s almost a private bay with crystal blue waters and stunning backdrop views!!! House was equipment with everything we needed including some lovely bits from Effie!!! The views from this place I cannot even describe it’s beautiful 10/10 recommended
38667437,Nitish June 2022 Effie's place in Pentati is amazing. We had a great stay there. Effie was at the apartment to help us check-in  and explained us everything (parking  supermarket etc.). I would highly recommend this place if you want to experience Corfu away from all the tourists.

38667437,Malte May 2022 Great place in a lovely mountain village with an astonishing view at the sea. You'll find everything you need for a relaxing stay in the apartment. Two beautiful taverns with great food  nice roof gardens and very hospitable owners are just a couple of minutes of walking away. You'll also find a mini market in the town  which offers all necessary groceries as well as freshly baked bread. Due to its central location  the apartment is ideal for day trips to discover the island. Effie is a courteous host  has always a good hint for a day trip or a restaurant visit and responds immediately to all your messages.

And Effie was a wonderful host  whenever we had a question she was quick to answer.
38667437,Laura April 2022 The place is exactly as described  beautifully located in a small village 30 minutes from Corfù Town.  The house is comfortable with an astonishing view.

38667437,Bohdan September 2021 A great place for a quiet holiday. We visited the whole island being close to the North and South. A few minutes by car to the nearest beach where you can relax  rent a boat and enjoy a delicious lunch. Very nice and friendly Effie gave us delicious fruits from her garden and eggs from her own hens. The apartment has everything you need and you can only come with hand luggage. My wife and I recommend this place.

38667437,Wolfgang August 2021 The charming apartment on the edge of a small village  with a unique view of a large bay of the sea  offered everything advertised in the description. The reception was personal and Effie has responded immediately to queries. One bedroom overlooks the bay and the living area is spacious  the second bedroom has a good double bed. Enough space for four people. Both bedrooms have aircondition what was indispensable in the hot nights in August.  The location is close to beautiful beaches and has two tavernas and a small grocery store. It is important to be mobile  either a car or a motorcycle  as the place cannot be reached by bus. Narrow romantic roads allow only smaller vehicles. The usual noises of a village are acceptable sometimes a bit too early.  We especially liked the personal contact with the grandmother  an active and sprightly woman who provided us several times with fruits. Maybe this is not the normal service but we enjoyed it.  Thanks Effie for your hospitality. Show more
38667437,Josephine July 2021 We had a beautiful stay at Effie‘s apartment in the small village with a beautiful view over the sea. Effie was a very kind and friendly host!

38667437,Gerrit September 2020 The house with the apartment is beautifully situated in 200m height on the slope of the west coast. The view from the balcony is fantastic. Having breakfast here is great.  The people of the village are very hospitable. By car it takes 15 minutes to reach a wonderfully quiet beach in Paramonas. If you like more life  you should go to Agios Gordios.  The hostess was very friendly and answered every question with pleasure. Thank you very much.
38667437,Rutger August 2020 Effie’s house is very comfortable and has everything you need for a great time in Corfu. The view from the balcony is beautiful indeed. A bit off the main road on a olive tree covered hill in the best (Western) part of Corfu  the village of Pentati is quiet  friendly and has some nice restaurants with super friendly people and home cooked Greek food.  Effie is a fantastic host  very responsive  helpful and friendly. She really thought along with us on how to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Plus her grandmother gave us fresh figs from the garden below the house and is the sweetest!  Would simply recommend this to anyone.
38667437,Stevie August 2020 Effie’s apartment is a great place to spend your holiday with the most gorgeous views you could ask for. We took a nice short hike to Agios Gordios from the apartment - it’s wonderfully situated for this and the hike is a nice way to explore the coast. Effie was able to be flexible with our arrival and leaving and is a really lovely person :)
38667437,"Anna July 2020 Effie is a great host. She always had time to answer all of our questions. We visited the apartment during covid-19 pandemic - she had a mask on  kept her distance and even provided us with a disinfecting gel. The apartment is spacious and has a lovely view from the balkony. There is a secluded beach within the walking distance but I wouldn't recommend it to families with young children. There are 2 great tavernas in the village. Our children prefered ""Angela's taverna"" (the owners has dog  cats and turtles and the kids loved playing with them)."
38667437,Anna October 2022 Enjoy your stay. She was so helpful. We were greeted with a nice surprise in the form of wine and snacks. The house was spacious and comfortably arranged. The kitchen has all the necessary appliances. Beautiful view from your patio. This is a peaceful and welcoming neighborhood. Nearby three taverns with delicious food  each worth a recommendation. We drove to the beaches because we wanted to get to know them closer and further  but we were happy to come back to our house and village for a true relaxation. Translated from Polish  Show original

38667437,Michael April 2022 We had two relaxing weeks in Corfu and a nice time in Pentati. Effi is a good host and took care of us. We say THANK YOU  also to her grandmother. We only met friendly people in the village and felt very comfortable. The kids could deal with the cats  dogs and chickens. The mountain roads require brave drivers and passengers...  Greetings from the Hunold family Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Jean-Paul October 2021 Effie is an exceptional host  both very present (welcome in the middle of the night  always reachable) and who does everything possible to welcome you. It remains discreet  but can move around if there is a problem  and this happened to us with a big storm. She's very responsive. Thanks to her. Translated from French  Show original
38667437,Marat September 2021 Nice apartment located in a quiet place with a beautiful view of the sea. Translated from Russian  Show original
38667437,Kerstin August 2021 We spent 4 days in Effie's apartment and felt very comfortable. Some of the furnishings are outdated  but it was very clean and the location is perfect with this view. Sofia's tavern below the house is especially recommended. Effie is quick to respond to questions. Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Julia July 2021 A very well maintained holiday home with fantastic views!  Fully equipped with everything you need  comfortably furnished and also pleasantly cool without using the existing air conditioning.  The hostess makes a great effort to ensure the well-being of the guests and is helpful with every question.  The neighborhood is located in a small village in the hills  a mini market and two highly recommended taverns are around the corner.  A perfect place to escape the stressful everyday life and unwind. However  a car is recommended  as the paths in the area are usually very steep.  We are very happy to have found this place and would love to come back! Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Angela October 2020 We felt completely comfortable in Effi's house and in the village. Effi is literally a Superhost. We can only agree with all the very good reviews  which were left before us by Effi's guests: very clean  well-equipped house  great views  a perfect hostess (not to mention her warm grandmother!)  a still really authentic Greek village with recommended tavern and a very good location for excursions to all interesting parts of the island. Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Martina August 2020 We had a wonderful quiet time in a beautiful mountain village. The accommodation is equipped with everything you need  plus fantastic views from the balcony. Effie is very nice  accessible at any time and her grandmother spoiled us with fruit and vegetables from her garden. You can eat very well in the village. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Charlotte October 2022 This property is just as stunning as it looks in these pictures. The inside has been renovated and looks absolutely great. You really can’t beat reclining on those sun loungers in the morning and kayaking after breakfast. Spyridoula is an absolutely brilliant host who could not have done more for us during our time there. The property really felt like a home away from home and we are certainly very keen to come back! I really can’t recommend this place more!
10722043,Georgia October 2022 Not too many homes with the sea at your front door. This area was very quiet when we visited in Oct. The weather was beautiful. The home was a little difficult to find as the GPS brings you to several in a row and you need to look for signs to find the home once you are in the drive. The home was very clean with great space. The pictures offered do need updating as it has changed. Over all I am sure it was a great picture of life on Corfu and the laid back atmosphere with the beautiful sea surrounding you. Easy access to the ferry (make sure you pick the one that is closer to the home. We thought we had but found out the ferry we used brought us to the town of Corfu which was very nice to see. We also stopped in small town near the home to shop and eat. Great people and great time. Wish we could have stayed longer to see the island as it seems to have everything from beaches to shopping to great eating places.
10722043,Rosey October 2022 We loved our stay at the Summer House. It was a perfect week for us. The location was fantastic  the house has everything you need and the position of the house near the sea was magical. We will be back!
10722043,Caroline October 2022 We had a fabulous week at The Summer House. The accommodation is comfortable & the location is fantastic. Waking up to the sound of the waves with the sea just past the end of the garden was wonderful. We relaxed in the garden   swam in the sea lots & chilled. Food supermarkets locally were well stocked but you need a car to get there. Lefkimmi has some nice tavernas & it was v easy to get a boat trip to Paxos from there. The Petrakis Taverna just round the corner is great & super easy to walk  canoe or paddle to!
10722043,Philip September 2022 We spent an amazing 11 nights at Summer House. The location is very private  often swimming on our own in the warm sea. Beautiful sunsets and a tranquility that took us a million miles from city life  almost like a retreat. A friendly Taverna a few minutes along the beach gave us a pleasant alternative to sunset bbqs. Spyridoula is an amazing host  very helpful  responding immediately and great for advice. First class holiday  we left with heavy hearts.
10722043,Sarah September 2022 Great place to stay  has everything you will need. Local driver recommended to us was great.
10722043,Harry September 2022 We arrived and it was pure bliss from there. Beautiful setting  there’s only one close restaurant but if you like cooking at home and just enjoy sunsets then this is the perfect place for you
10722043,Fozia August 2022 Feel so relaxed after our stay at the beach house. It was such a special and magical place to stay. The sunsets are brilliant and the stars too. The walk to the taverna was fun and its a great spot to eat by the beach. Lefkimmi town was lovely- not touristy even in August. l loved this part of Corfu and really like the Riverside restaurant Agali and there was another lovely place opposite the bakery (which you should try- delicious cakes). It's a perfect place for kids- you can relax as the water was so calm and shallow but not too shallow that you can't go out for a lovely swim. Spyridoula was such a brilliant person- really response and great recommendations. Thanks Spryridoula for a wonderful stay!
10722043,Fang Fang August 2022 The photos are not updated  but we do enjoyed the house and the access to the sea:) very easy communication and flexible with arrival. I recommend.
10722043,Nicola August 2022 A wonderful week in this idyllic  beachside cottage. It's really well equipped  spotlessly clean and off the beaten tourist track. A taverna on the doorstep and endless swimming (shallow sea) a step from the end of the garden. Also loads to do nearby. Sunsets looking out over the sea are breathtaking. Highly recommend.
10722043,Elliot Jay August 2022 If you like having the sea at the back of your garden (and who doesn’t?)  then this is a little piece of paradise. The sea is very shallow for a very long way out and the tide barely changes  so it’s an ideal and safe place for kids to play — and no stresses for grown-ups who aren’t strong swimmers! We spent most evenings out on the sea in the provided kayaks  watching the sun set over the hills opposite. Bliss!  A lot of Corfu has been spoiled by tourism  but this is tucked away in a little corner of seclusion — although most things are a drive away. However  if you’d really rather not drive  you can always wade through the sea to the local taverna.  We had a wonderful holiday  Spyridoula was fantastic with her communication (including getting an air con fault fixed immediately) and we’d thoroughly recommend her place. Thank you for having us!
10722043,Alison August 2022 Absolutely amazing! The house has everything in it that you need and things you didn’t know you needed for your stay! The location was perfect  so quiet and peaceful for a relaxing break. Having the sea at the garden gate was perfect  the water was calm  warm and shallow so perfect for my daughter to spend hours swimming while I watched from the hammock. The kayaks were great fun- we paddled down to the restaurant for dinner (the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and a great menu) Spyridoula was easily contactable during our stay to give any assistance needed and she arranged a local driver to bring me to the house and to the airport at a cost less than a taxi would have cost.  Perfect holiday  I will definitely visit again.
10722043,Emily July 2022 A perfect cottage  with everything you could possibly need. Spyridoula could not have been more helpful with organising our transfers and making sure we had everything we needed. Would recommend!
10722043,Chih-Kao June 2022 We have a lovely 5 day stay here : The „walk-in“ beach  the well-cared Garten  the great sea view 100 Meter away from beach the Water level are not even deeper than 1 .2meter  very safe place to enjoy the sea. we had lot of fun with the kayak! Spyridoula is such friendly and helpful  always answered in few minutes and recommended us some restaurants which indeed very tasty and with faire price. We have already recommended this place to all our friends in Germany and hope to visit here again :)  Best regards from Berlin  HSU & Li
10722043,Andrea May 2022 Fantastic house in a perfect location and an amazing host!
10722043,Mikk May 2022 Wonderful little garden with gates to the sea! We stayed in the middle of May and and we spent most of our days swimming and playing in the water. We really enjoyed our meals at nearby Taverna Petrakis.
10722043,Susan May 2022 The most wonderful location! Perfect to rest and relax with excellent local taverna a very short walk away
10722043,Ebony May 2022 Such a beautiful piece of paradise. We stayed for a week with our 6 month baby  and the summer house was the perfect location to enjoy Corfu. The property is beautiful and well equipped  and the sound of the sea lapping the shore is so relaxing. Spyridoula provided us with some excellent recommendations which were extremely helpful  and we enjoyed some delicious meals at the local tavernas. We will definitely be back again to to enjoy this gorgeous property and location.
10722043,Emma Jane April 2022 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the summer house. It was perfect for our 3 year old. Everything we needed was at our fingertips. Having the beach and sea outside the garden gates was perfect. Lots of fun on the kayaks. We cannot wait to visit again!
10722043,Christine April 2022 Though we did not meet her  she was available within the minute and always very helpful
10722043,Sarah April 2022 We stayed at the beach house early April and it was so quiet and peaceful. Nothing within walking was open but we were really happy to shop in nearby supermarkets and eat at the house  or drive to nearby restaurants. There is nothing like the sea being right outside the garden gate - so relaxing. I ventured a couple of chilly swims - not for the faint-hearted at this time of year - but it was fun to paddle up and down in the kayaks. We genuinely did not want to leave and could happily have spent a month there.
10722043,Yefeng October 2021 I have been to many Air Bnbs. However  never one whose back garden literally is next to the sea.  Spyridoula's is simply incredibly. it really is as beautiful as the pictures.  highly recommended.
10722043,Keziah September 2021 Spyridoula is an excellent host! Very communicative  the Airbnb is clean  and view is gorgeous! Thank you so much for everything!!
10722043,Vera September 2021 Beautiful property in an amazing waterfront setting. We loved the garden area and morning coffee on the beach with our toes in the water! Gorgeous sunset views as well. Do be clear on directions as first-time arrival may not be obvious for some drivers.
10722043,Paola August 2021 Beautiful
10722043,"Ryan August 2021 If you want peace  quiet (minus aircraft noise from the airport)  and your own sandy beach. This house is best! I would highly suggest for a small family as the beds and size of the home would accommodate no more than 4 people. the beach was great  having to not deal with crowds while enjoying 200 meters out from coast of ""walkable"" water is always a plus when trying to be socially distant. Communication was fast and check in was easy. helpful tip: bring mosquito repellent"
10722043,Lihi August 2021 Our family of 6 had an amazing vacation. The garden is lovely and the beach is a dream. We truly recommend staying here.
10722043,Teodor July 2021 This is indeed a lovely place to stay  far away from any distraction  in a quiet and peaceful corner of the island. We loved the calm of the sea in the early hours of the morning. The garden is very pleasant at any time. The pictures of the property speak of its' charm  so  there is no need to recount it. Before arriving here  one may better think to choose well his/her company but to bring few personal items  as many won't be needed.
10722043,Kate June 2021 It’s quiet  as beautiful as it looks and just lovely. The taverna almost next door is great too- just a few yards down the beach or (as the kids liked to do) a few minutes kayaking! Everything is provided. Even books  towels and mosquito repellent! The kayaks were a great hit with all of us too. So easy to use in the shallow warm water. Thank you xxx
10722043,Anna May 2021 The house is a gem  located straight at the beach with a wonderful greed garden. The sea is not deep straight away so the water is very warm. Everything what you need to chill and enjoy is provided: hammock  hanging chair  sun beds  kayaks  barbecue.  Spyridoula is a wonderful host  very friendly and welcoming  if anything needs to be fixed then it is done straight away.  We enjoyed our stay very much!
10722043,Matthew May 2021 delightfully out of the way the house is an idek retreat to look for some peaceful relaxation.
10722043,Colin May 2021 Dream cottage in a quiet part of Corfu  as it should be.
10722043,Henning October 2020 The house is absolutely lovely  very nice garden and located directly at the waterfront with great views. We enjoyed kayaking a lot with the kayaks being part of the property. The welcome and check in was warm and excellent. Thanks Charilaos!
10722043,Adie October 2020 fabulous chill pad on the beach
10722043,Andy September 2020 Great chill place. You need a car to appreciate this corner of Corfu. Petrakis taverna just along the beach are very accommodating. Even cooked us a corfiot special which we hadn’t tried before.
10722043,Fiona August 2020 We think this is the most beautiful spot in Corfu! The garden is a haven (and listen out for the wild tortoise scuffling along in the drainage channel) - the perfect place to relax and read and enjoy the heavenly view. The children loved swimming in the shallow  safe waters  looking for seashells and trying out the kayaks. It's also a great location for exploring the south of Corfu. The premises were spotlessly clean  and Charilaos was a caring host who checked in to see that we were okay. Just remember the mosquito repellent!
10722043,Julia August 2020 Amazing location next to the sea with beautiful sunsets! (Yes it really is as gorgeous as the photos suggest!)  A lovely place to relax - the garden  warm sea on your doorstep and beautiful sunsets make Summer House on the Beach really special.  The local Taverna is a 5 minute walk along the beach - a wonderful place to have a relaxed meal (right on the beach!)  fresh fish and other local dishes.  The house itself was clean and functional. All communication was straightforward and easy.  I would recommend some mosquito repellent for evenings outside!!
10722043,Claire July 2020 Such a wonderful stylish and comfortable house and the location is sublime. The sea is literally at the bottom of the beautiful garden. Our children loved the garden and the sea on our doorstep. We highly recommend a stay at this lovely home.
10722043,Klara July 2020 The summerhouse was very nice and just perfect for us with two kids (2 and 6 years old). The beach is sandy  the water is very warm and the garden is a dream. The apartment has everything you need. Charilaos and his family are very good hosts. They are kind and helpful. Thanks for the welcome basket! Close to the house is one other house. Our neighbors were very kind and respectful.
10722043,Ronnie October 2019 As beautiful as the pictures suggest. A near perfect spot for us and three young children who happily spent hours pottering around the garden  beach and warm  shallow waters. Views of Albanian/Greek coast and mountains are very special and taverna just a few minutes along the beach was a real bonus.
10722043,Bas October 2019 I've never written a review before  and I don't want to make it a habit  but this place deserves an exception. As it is exceptional. What a marvelous stay! There will be numerous houses on beaches  but I figure that most of them have a concrete or stone garden  but not this house: it's green and lush  with plants en trees  even on the beach itself. Furthermore  it's very convenient for kids: there're plenty of toys  and the sea is never deeper that around 50cm. Very cosy  very friendly  and a sincere recommendation.
10722043,Gwen October 2019 This beautiful home on the beach is just the nicest place you can ever hope to stay. Haris' mum and dad arrange where to meet to lead you to the house. And they are the absolutely loveliest people anyone could hope to meet. Haris' mum (Panagiota) even took the care to help me finalise plans to hire a car before we even got to Corfu. You really are in safe hands! Absolutely everything you need is already in the house. Everything that is listed is there and more. The beach is sandy  the water is warm  the barbecue has it all. Inside the bed's are comfy  the kitchen is really well equipped. The wifi is great and on a stormy night you can watch netflix on the big tv! If you want to travel round the island  Panagiota will tell you where the best spots to go are. It is a family home in the most idyllic spot you can find. But above all  it's invested with a soul that makes you feel very much at home too. We can't recommend this beautiful home highly enough and will be coming back next year!
10722043,Ashleigh September 2019 In a word: outstanding. Everything was simply perfect and exactly what we expected from the airbnb listing! The house has all the amenities you could need (including beach towels!). The beach is easily accessible and the water was lovely. We ate in the taverna (Petrakis Taverna) a number of times and the food was delicious and the best thing is it's just a short walk along the beach to get there. Panagiota was a wonderful host - very helpful and quick to respond to messages. I would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful place. Many thanks Panagiota and Haris!
10722043,Mark August 2019 A truly lovely little spot. The kids were in the sea from morning to night and we could watch them from the garden. The house has everything you need and Haris is at hand for help and advice.
10722043,Elena August 2019 Haris and Panagiota are the hosts of outstanding hospitaly  warm and caring  very responsive. Their summer house on the beach is highly recommended as a private paradise escape  where one can forget about the noise and stress back home. Just have your bathing suit on and charge your battaries with sun and sea power :-))) We hope to be back soon  Haris  thank you so much for a lovely week at your house this year. Our kind regards  Elena with family
10722043,Janet August 2019 If you value peace  privacy and a fantastic location  you will enjoy this house. We arrived in the early hours of the morning  even later than expected due to a delayed flight  but Haris was waiting for us. There was a bit of a mix up before we set off  as I thought he might be able to pick us up at the airport  but we were able to book a taxi instead. Be aware that if you arrive after 11pm  you will not usually be able to pick a hire car up at the airport. I was glad about that  however  as the hour-long drive is a bit hair-raising and I would not have wanted to attempt it in the dark. The best value taxi was Travelco of Corfu  which is pre-bookable online. It was expensive  but worth it. Summer House is exactly as you see it online  only I thought it felt a bit smaller - plenty of room for us though! If I had one criticism  it is that the kitchen area needs updated - counter space is very limited and everything is crushed into one corner. There is  however  a great big fridge-freezer. There was a lovely welcome package of food and the air conditioning was on  which was much appreciated  since it was a very warm night. The house was very clean and included everything you could think of  from games and toys  to rain ponchos and maps. Best of all  30ft down the garden and a step beyond the back fence was the beach  with the water going 300ft out at waist level. There is an airbnb next door of similar size  but apart from that and the odd passerby  you have the beach and a wonderful view of the bay to yourself. You can walk through the water  shoes in hand  up to the nearby Petrakis Taverna  which is what we did several times for lunch or dinner (Christos and his uncle Spiros  are lovely  helpful hosts). A car is a necessity  since the village of Lefkimmis is 2km away and the nearest supermarket is 3km away. We hired our car from Christos Fonteinos of Drivibe  Lefkimmi. I asked for the petrol tank to come full  but it came less than a quarter full. Apart from that  though  the rate was good and the car was fine for our needs. You need to take care driving through narrow village streets and pot-holed roads in Corfu  so I would advise taking out additional insurance coverage for any excess before you go. Once you go through the village  you reach the main road connecting Kavos to Corfu town. There is a JetOil petrol station down and across the road to the left  or a Shell petrol station a bit up the road on your right. We shopped at Dimitra's supermarket  where the staff were very helpful and which offers everything you could possibly need - it is just across the road to the right  on the bend. Lefkimmi has several good restaurants which are reasonably priced. It is worth searching out for the ones which offer traditional Corfiot dishes like Sofrito  Stifado  Pastisado  Pasticcio etc. While our house was virtually bug-proof  you need plenty of mosquito spray with you as I got quite a few bites sitting outside. We did not drive much  but we visited nearby beaches Boukka and Marathias  Petriti for dinner at a waterside taverna  and a drive through Kavos (yikes!). Since our flight did not depart until midnight on the last day  Christos at Petrakis Taverna was able to arrange a room for us for showering and an afternoon nap. His uncle  Eugene  drove us back to the airport for half what it cost us coming in! We had a lovely  quiet relaxing time at Summer House  away from the bustling tourist crowds. It was a little bit of heaven and I would certainly return and recommend to anyone. Show more
10722043,Emily June 2019 Certainly recommend! Pick up a rental car and stay here  you won’t regret it  Taverna within walking distance on the beach  and everything else a short but beautiful drive away.
10722043,Adie June 2019 Paradise in a little corner of heaven
10722043,Katriina June 2019 The house is everything the add promises or maybe even better. The house was clean and cosy  the garden is green and pleasant and the beach is shallow  water is clear and warm and the house is located in a very peaceful  quiet and private spot. The house really is at the beach - the waterline nearly touches the garden gate. Our holiday there was very relaxing. Evenings were very nice sitting at the porch watching the sea and listening the waves. The beach is ideal and very safe for small children - we were accompanied by a three-year-old who spent her days swimming and as the water is so shallow and the waves weren't big it was very easy for us to guard her. The hosts were very helpful and answered quickly to our questions. We would love to come back some day and warmly recommend this place.
10722043,Mattea June 2019 The private beach just outside the tiny green garden is a rest for the soul and a true gem for any sea/beach lover. It is a highlight of this property and a true private oasis.
10722043,Mieke May 2019 We had a very nice stay at the Sunny house at the beach. The weather was not always good. But we drive a lot in our rental car. From south to north. From east to west. A lovely island. Panagiota is very friendly kind and caring!
10722043,Gary April 2019 This is an ideal beach location. The house is the cleanest we’ve been in over many years of using air bnb. Hospitality by the host was excellent. It was a wonderful place to stay.
10722043,Radim September 2018 Great appartment filled with anything you may need including washing machine and two bahtrooms. Quiet place with sea on your frontyard (!). Great for kids as the bay is shallow with warm water. Panagiota quickly helped us with any of our needs.
10722043,Anja September 2018 It was a pleasant stay....and we wish to come back soon.
10722043,Monika August 2018 Panagiota's place is exactly as on the photos and a little better on top of that. It is in a very quiet part of the island. One taverna walking distance and 2 big supermarket within 10 min. drive. We even got some fresh fish from the nearby dock in the morning when the fishermen came back from the sea and made use of the outside grill in the garden. There were mosquitoes and quite a few wasps when we ate outside. But nothing that would spoil the relaxed feeling of the place  beautiful sunsets and amazingly warm and shallow water - perfect set up for the kids.
10722043,Anna August 2018 We spent two amazing weeks in this lovely house. Panagiota helped us so much with the instructions and we visited a lot of interesting activities. The location is perfect - it is very quiet here  very nice neighbours. You can easily get fresh fish or shrimps in the morning or afternoon. Lefkimmi is very peaceful village and Panagiota provided us with all necessary contacts.  We enjoyed our stay here very much.
10722043,Max August 2018 The house is everything described in the listing - quaint  private and well accoutered. Plenty of sheets  towels  soaps  etc. Directly on the water and a short walk from a nice taverna  the location is really fantastic. Would recommend a rental car to be able to get to the food market and other parts of the island during a visit. Panagiota is an excellent host who kindly left us fresh food to start our stay and provides recommendations for things to do. Highly recommend it - we spent about 10 days there with our two-year-old and had a fabulous time.
10722043,Elena July 2018 This is a great place to stay at for a family holiday. We love to travel and do it as frequently as we can  this is definitely one of the best places we got to stay at. You get nearly a private beach with shallow  clean and warm Ionic sea waters. Safe for the kids and good chance how to learn to swim. We enjoyed the paddle boat rides and had a fantastic relaxing time in the garden  where you have plenty of space to eat breakfast while watching the calm sea  read a book in the hammock  grill fresh fish from the harbor on the grill or just open the fence gate and enjoy the sea. A very nice Petrakis taverna is at a 2-minutes walk distance from the house along the beach. Try their greek salad  you will not be disapponted! They have free table tennis as well. You will find two grocery shops   which are Lidl and Dimitra market at a driving distance of around 5 minutes. More tavernas and places to get a lunch / dinner or just get a coffe and an ice-cream can be found in Lefkimmi  around 5 minutes by car. Panagiota and her son Haris are great hosts  they respond quickly to any needs and are very helpful. They welcomed us with fresh fruit  cold water  wine and a chocolate cake - the charming Greek hospitality. You will need a car to get around and experience the nature and small villages around. When you do that  please  rent a boat for a day! It was a magical day for us  when we anchored the boat and went swimming 2-3 km away from the shore in the same shallow magical waters of the Ionian sea! It was an unforgettable week  we do hope to come back and can recommend it as your next vacation place. Show more
10722043,Inken July 2018 A very special and beautiful place we can highly recommend.
10722043,Stuart May 2018 This is a great place to stay in the rustic south of Corfu. The location is awesome and we all (teenagers and parents) felt so privileged to be able to step from the house into the sea. There are barely any neighbours  so it’s really private. The outside hot shower was perfect. Shops are a short drive away  and Pelakis’ taverna on the beach just a short stroll through the surf is excellent. If you choose a time when the weather is baking hot (most of the time!)  you’ll love this place; there’s abundant open sky for sun worshipers and plenty of shade for those of us prone to overheating! The shallow sea is just divine  as is the house and it’s owner  who deserves a special mention for the special welcome we received.
10722043,Sarah April 2018 Panagiota is a wonderful host and available whenever needed! The house is very cosy and directly located at the beach so it is the perfect place to relax. But (due to the fact that the island is small) also central. The house comes with a lot of lovely details like flowers  games  and even binoculars to explore the neighborhood:) so you have everything you need. We had a great time and felt at home right away!! I would love to come back some time and would recommend the house to everyone who likes to take some time off and relax during their holidays. Thank your very much Panagiota:)
10722043,Tony April 2018 Wonderful private location. Accommodation very homely with everything you need - home from home. The whole family loved it here from our youngest children to our teenagers. We will definitely be back now we have discovered this little gem of a property. On arrival we were made to feel very welcome and was pleasantly surprised that everything we could of needed during our stay was available to us. Would not hesitate to recommend to others and have already done so.
10722043,Karina October 2017 Very cosy beachhouse in a very quiet area of Korfu. The beach is perfect for kids. The nearby restaurant is very good
10722043,Deborah October 2017 This was already our second stay at the summerhouse on the sandy beach and it was as wonderful as last year. The house is very cute and cosy and has everything you need. The location is perfect for being at the sea with children who cannot swim yet or for anyone who loves shallow warm water. We spent a very relaxing lazy two weeks there. This house is a hidden treasure! :-)
10722043,John August 2017 We had a great time here. The location is wonderful and perfect if you want a quiet beach holiday. Its ideal for young children as the sea is shallow and the kayaks were great for the older children too. The house is well equipped and the garden perfect for cooking and relaxing in. We really enjoyed being in south Corfu its much quieter and more traditional than the north and we particularly enjoyed our trips to nearby Lefkimmi.
10722043,Espen July 2017 The house is very nice  the area quiet  beach just 2 meters away  and all in all an amazing place. Two canoes comes with the house  and they were in constant use. Panagiota was easy to communicate with  and met us planned. We also really appreciated the fruit  vegetable  bread  wine and water she had left for us. Would recommend this house to anyone.
10722043,Alexandra June 2017 This place was incredible! Such a perfect quiet location - almost felt like our private beach. The house is very cute  and has everything you need  including board games! Panagiota and Harris were super helpful and very quick to respond. Really I can't wait to go back  and have already recommended to friends.
10722043,Efrosini June 2017 We had a magical time in Panagiotia's home by the sea. Such joy to wake up to a beautiful sea. The house was very comfortable for our family of 4. Panagiota's son met us at the house and gave us a thorough tour. He was very friendly and helpful. The kitchen was well resourced and thoughtfully stocked. Kids had lots of beach toys to play with. The beach was also secluded  which was a bonus and very calm  perfect for the kids. We also had a lovely dinner at the tavern 80m away. Thank you Panagiotia.
10722043,Katja June 2017 The house of Panagiota is fantastic and can not be described with words.We were there with our sons 18 16 and 12 years. And we had a very nice holiday.The sea was very warm. We loved the barbecue with sea view and sunset. It is a quiet location. The house is well equipped. Panagiota and their family are very nice and always approachable.The island has very nice places and all were very nice. The try the different taverns with the local cost is recommended. Panagiota- Thank you for everything. We will be back definitely.
10722043,Jaime May 2017 We had a wonderful time at Panagiota's place. The house is in a beautiful setting  is well equipped  the food and drink we were provided with on arrival was wonderful and Panagiota and her son were such attentive  generous  kind  helpful people - their hospitality was amazing.  We travelled with our 19 month old baby who had a ball - she loved the house  the garden  beach... I wouldn't hesitate recommending this place to families or couples. The house isn't situated in a touristy part of the island but it was even better for that I think!  A special mention must go to Vaso and her fantastic family run taverna about 50m along the beach. Such a friendly  welcoming place  in a great location. Do try the Gofos fish and prawn saganaki when you visit!
10722043,Peter May 2017 Lovely accomodation  great hosts  a place called Paradise! Don't bring lots of stuff as everything is there. Rent a car for your own convenience as the place is somewhat out of town.
10722043,Deborah October 2016 We spent 2 fantastic weeks at the summerhouse on the sandy beach! The sea is very shallow  and therefore the water stays very warm -> perfect for children. We  a family of four with children aged 4 & 6  stayed there the first half of October  and this was our best holiday at the sea ever. You are not near the beach  you are AT the beach! So whenever you feel like  you just jump out of the garden door  into the water. Paddeling along with the boats was also great fun. The garden is great for relaxing  reading  BBQing  and the children loved climbing in and out of the hammocks and up and down the tyre on the rope. The house is equipped with everything you need and furnished with great love and care. Panagiota and her husband gave us a very warm welcome at the house  including fresh vegetables  olive oil and homemade marmelade and wine! They explained us everything about the house  Lefkimmi and the region. Panagiota let us know when the flamingoes arrived at the saltpans  so we could go for a walk there and spotted them. The petrakis family restraurant is highly recommendable if you don't feel like cooking yourself  very children friendly. (Everyone LOVES childeren there!) I had the best Tsatsiki ever!!! We definitely would love to come back again! Response from Spyridoula October 2016 Dear Deborah  It was a pleasure to meet you. Welcome you back anytime! All the best to you.
10722043,Yana September 2016 Panagiota is a very friendly and welcoming host  she greeted us with all the information we needed about the locality. She'd also left some bread  home made wine and preserves for us  as well as some lovely olive oil. The house is very cosy  it has everything you might need on a Corfu holiday and more. The garden is amazing with lots of space for relaxation and a bbq which we took advantage of. Being right on the beach  the house is in a perfect location with a friendly taverna 3 mins walk away. The village of Lefkimi itself is a short drive away and has all you might need including supermarkets and places to eat.  Panagiota is very quick to react to any questions that might arise  I'd definitely recommend her place and go back there again.  Yana
10722043,Kerry September 2016 Panagiota made us feel very welcome and was a lovely friendly host. The house is everything it says on the tin and is in a very beautiful tranquil setting. A car is essential if you wish to explore the local beaches/area. You must also be prepared to carry luggage shopping etc 80metres along the beach from the car park.. This only added to the adventure for us. The outside hot shower was a real treat after a sunset swim  the wifi was good and the local taverna provided great morning coffee. All in all it was a very relaxing holiday on a beautiful beach away from the crowds and hustle and bustle of life. Many thanks to Panagiota for being such a gracious attentive host.
10722043,Alexandra August 2016 A great location for a beach vacation  whether for couples or families with children. God willing  we would love to come back to explore the beautiful island  because this time all I wanted to do was to stay in the garden  on the beach or in the sea. While it is true that one needs a car to do grocery shopping (the hosts gave us a ride to the local supermarket once)  it is quite possible to plan and shop for the entire stay. The kitchen is well equipped and there is ample space both in the fridge and freezer. We also walked to the village a couple of times. The Petrakis Taverna is very close  offering decent breakfast  lunch  dinner and drinks at reasonable prices. We particularly appreciated being picked up at the airport at 4.30 am. Arriving at 5.30  we were delighted to find fresh vegetables  bread  milk  coffee  wine and watermelon awaiting. The house is otherwise very well-eqiupped  including board games and art supplies  as well as the even more important first-aid kit! The bed linen and towels are of superior quality. It is also possible to get help from a cleaning lady  and she does a great job  too. The internet connection worked fine even for streaming videos (one device was perfectly fine  while streaming to two devices could get a bit tricky)  but uploading large files did not go as smoothly. I did  however  succeed in uploading large photos on Dropbox eventually  but these huge work files might have to wait. In other words - a totally adequate internet connection. The hosts are well-organized and efficient. We didn't experience any emergencies  yet  on one occasion  Panagiota and her family acted immediately when we needed. Show more
10722043,Peter July 2016 The perfect relaxing beach getaway. As a pairing of two couples  the beach house offered a wonderful opportunity to get away from it all. Panagiota was able to answer every question we had before we flew out and was there at the airport to guide us to the beach house  having recommended the best car rental for the week.  Idyllically situated right on the shoreline  we had to walk through the surf to get to the door  a lovely way to start the holiday  in addition to fresh watermelon  bread and tomatoes to greet us. We had the entire beach between ourselves and the residents of the neighbouring beach house for the week  and the calm waters were perfect for swimming  snorkeling and kayaking. Furthermore the garden offers the perfect mix of shady spaces and sunny spots  with hammocks  deck chairs and loungers as well as the beach itself. Furthermore the set up of the beach house was perfect for two couples  with two spacious bedroom areas and two separate bathrooms  plus the communal kitchen / dining space. While we spent most of our time outdoors  this made for a cosy indoor space for the end of the evening  before passing out in the comfortable double beds.  The local shops were a short 5 minute drive  from which we were able to source all of our bbqing needs  having made the most of the garden grill on a number of occasions. Further afield in the car we enjoyed dinner in Lefkimmi and took a boat trip to Paxos and Antipaxos from the port. We also made use of Panagoita's local guides to visit the beach at Gardenos  and would recommend everyone to go for at least one drink in the secret paradise bar along the beach; a bit of a walk  but the breathtaking view  brilliant barman and isolated beach loungers make it more than worthwhile.  Overall the holiday was absolutely brilliant. Panagoita was an excellent host and was there to answer all our queries beforehand and during our stay. The beach house itself is fantastic  it isn't every day you get to wake up to a deserted beach all to yourself  having fallen asleep to the sound of the sea Ideally situated to get away from it all  but still be within a short drive for shops  places to eat and drink  and other places to explore. However  I imagine just like us you'll simply spend it enjoying your own private beach for the duration of your stay  simply unbeatable. Show more
10722043,Le June 2016 We had such a lovely time at the summer house. Thank you so much  dear Panagiota and your family  for your hospitality. See you and all the best!

That cute little house in the Greek style💙  with a green garden💙  right on the seafront💙  in a small town away from the tourist hustle and bustle of the rest of the island💙  embraces you with calmness  its coziness and the gorgeous blue views of the sea and the oranges of sunsets.

10722043,Sabine October 2020 A true paradise to relax! The quiet  direct beach location  the beautiful  very well-equipped and clean house and the small garden with the hanging chair I particularly loved leave nothing to be desired. Panagiota and Haris are extremely attentive and friendly hosts. I was very warmly welcomed  provided with many helpful tips for exploring the area and as a welcome there was a basket with delicious  regional products. Efcharistó polý.

10722043,Matthias August 2020 Charilaos is a great host  the place is really uniquely beautiful for a relaxing beach holiday right by the sea in a shallowly sloping bay. We relaxed very well and enjoyed bathing in the warm water as well as the great sunsets. Thank you!! Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Chantal September 2019 I spent nine nights in this wonderful place. If you are looking for peace and quiet  this is the place to be. The sea right in front of you  what's more beautiful... If you don't feel like cooking  you can take your feet in the water to the Taverna Petrakis  the food there is great! I hope to come back soon.... Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Dorien August 2019 The house is nice  but not very large. Everything you need is here. The strength is especially in the fantastic garden and the location by the sea. I found Lefkimmi and its surroundings little interesting  but we had enough of a stay around the house  it was extremely relaxed  a bit atmosphere like in the tropics. Translated from Dutch  Show original
10722043,Doris July 2019 The Summerhouse is great in its naturalness  its proximity to nature and its comfort. A wonderful place for people who love a little individuality and are happy not to have too much tourism stress. Haris is a loving and understated host. Always there when you need it. We will be back. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Isabel May 2019 The house is really great! The beautiful garden is right on a small stretch of beach. The amenities were more extensive than we expected! Great place to relax! Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Undine October 2018 We had a great time in Corfu. The house was clean and cozy  the location by the sea was just fantastic! It is a place to feel good and relax. Panagiota is a great host and explained everything to us perfectly and answered our questions directly by email. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Natalia June 2018 We were very happy we chose this house! We had a wonderful and relaxing vacation there. The warm sea at the doorstep of the house is like in paradise! The house has absolutely everything for living. Panagiota is a wonderful host and nice person. Many thanks to her! Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Jacobien May 2018 This cottage is a little paradise. Right by the sea  a beautiful spacious garden with sun and shade and a veranda. From the house  it is a short walk along the water to Taverna Petrakis where you can enjoy your meals. You can buy fresh fish directly from the fishermen. Kerkyra is a short hour drive. Furthermore  there are beautiful beaches nearby (we found Gardenos a nice place) and also the coast between Petriti and Notos is very beautiful. Panagiota is very helpful and nice attentions upon arrival. Bottles of wine  strawberries  tomatoes  etc.  were displayed on the table. In short  a very nice place  located in a quiet part of Corfu. Translated from Dutch  Show original
10722043,Harold May 2018 Panagiota was waiting for us a few blocks away to guide us to the cottage accessible by a sandy road. Once there  we got homemade delicacies and told them about the area in good English. The cottage has one bedroom  separate area in the living room with 3 beds and two sofas on which you could sleep. The kitchen is well equipped. The two bathrooms were very convenient with our two daughters. The house is fine to keep at temperature with air conditioning. Outside there are many types of chairs and hammocks to enjoy the sun and the fantastic views. In the garden there is a good BBQ and the garden looks well-kept and cheerful with the flowers. Right behind the garden is a mini beach of a few meters. Perfect for lounging. The water hardly rises at high tide. There are two canoes with which everyone can get on the water. It is quite a bit of rowing or swimming to reach the deeper water. So ideal to play in the water. You can stand very far in the water while the water comes to your center. The area was a bit quiet in May. It is a small village with nice Greeks who open a restaurant if you want to eat there. It is an environment to relax and unwind. We ourselves hardly made it to the garden and the beach. The view is unforgettable; a paradise. Literally a few steps from a quiet beach is pure luxury. Definitely a place for us to come back.

10722043,Sarah April 2018 Nice house on the beach  fantastic with children. The house has everything you need (also lots of scoops and other beach gear). The house is otherwise quite basic  but fine!

10722043,Павел September 2017 Great place ! Small beach that was instantly warmed up in the sun . And - a step to the beach   wear floats and go ! Fantastic place. Flying in like a day for two weeks! For those who will relax there  I recommend visiting the town of Chlomos  the fish restaurant in Petrikis Limnopoula  Marathias beach  this is one of the things nearby . Be sure to go to the marina at 8.30 and buy some fish to grill it in the evening and open a bottle of white wine to the sound of the raining waves . There is a baby cot and high chair in the house. At the back of the house is a wardrobe full of children's toys . Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Bastien July 2017 We had a lovely holiday at this beautiful house by the sea. It is a cozy little house with a garden that directly overlooks the beach. It's a perfect spot for families. Kids can enjoy the garden and sea (little background for a long time). The place is very quiet and relaxing. Translated from French  Show original
10722043,Roberto June 2017 The stay was pleasant and without worries. Panagiota and her son are very caring and gave us great advice. The accommodation is spacious  well equipped  simply and tastefully furnished  equipped with a beautiful garden that overlooks the beach  with hammocks  deckchairs  shower  barbecue fireplace and every comfort. Everything is set up for families with children  but the house is also perfect for a couple on an evergreen honeymoon! Translated from Italian  Show original

10722043,Olesia August 2016 My family and I had an amazing vacation. It was an unforgettable vacation. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. It turned out to be exactly as it appears on the website. Panagiota  was very attentive. Always ready to help. Her home is so warm and cozy you don't want to leave. It has everything you need for two lovers and families with children. It's a place where everyone can find something to do. In the morning the sea  in the afternoon a hammock in the shade of cedar and olive trees. You can just lie down to read. The child never wanted to leave the sea. There are books  board games and everything you need for the sea (air mattress  bucket with sand and water supplies)  as well as for adults two small boats with paddle boats that anyone can control  never even a person doing it. It was lovely. And in the evening the sunsets are magical. There are shops nearby that have everything you need (fresh fruits  vegetables  meat  fish). My husband and I walked to the port in the morning and bought freshly caught fish from the fishermen. There is a large oven in the yard  where you can make barbecue. If you don't want to cook  there is a tavern Petrakis within walking distance  where you can taste fresh fish cooked by you. Again  thank you very much to Panagiota and her family for this wonderful vacation! I think I'll go next year with my family. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Vincent June 2016 We had a fabulous week at panagiota's place! The accommodation was even better than we imagined  a real break  quiet facing the sea... We only had very little to visit the surroundings so much we were well at home. Panagiota welcomed us warmly with her husband  available when we needed her. I highly recommend this accommodation  for families (ideal with children) or friends. We keep a very nice memory of it. Translated from French  Show original
657108834476555452,Calum September 2022 Villa is spectacular  with amazing views of the beach. Lots of sunbeds and outdoor seating suitable for everyone  pool is large and villa is comfy and homely. would advise having a car as the area is incredibly hilly but you can make do without a car as we did. great facilities and incredibky helpful hosts.
657108834476555452,Kosta September 2022 Cannot find words to express my satisfaction - everything was perfect
657108834476555452,Roxana-Geta September 2022 Our stay at this wonderful house was exactly what we were looking for. The location of the villa is perfect if you want to visit the best of Corfu  most of the island’s highlights being a short drive away. The Agios Georgios beach is 5 minutes away and it provider everything you would need  from taverns with great food to supermarkets. The house was clean and it’s very spacious. All the rooms have air conditioning which was much needed. The kitchen is very well equipped and has everything you would ever need. That being said the highlight of Villa Delfini is the exterior. Multiple seating areas to relax  enjoy a drink and get lost in the beautiful scenery that the islands has to offer. We arrived quite late and we had a very nice surprise seeing the lit pool that looks even better in person than in the pictures.  Overall i highly recommend staying if you visit Corfu.

24556512,Sabine September 2022 one of the best hosts we ever had. Debbie is very cute  super helpful and soooo funny. Staying at her place is staying closer to the nature. We loved it and will always remember our time there. Thank you. And remember: We are doing nothing and haven't finished yet. Miau Sabine and Sven
24556512,Christoph September 2022 Very relaxing place  built with love! We had some great days  everything was working fine (kitchen  water  solar  toilet - very clean) Debbie was very friendly - lovingly! Strong recommendation for people who like glamping!
24556512,Amanda September 2022 Debbie is a wonderfull person with great tips on what to do on your stay. The place has some really nice views. the road there is a little difficult but totally worth it in my opinion.
24556512,Isa August 2022 It is a great experience if you want to get away from city life for a while. Debbie is super helpful and sweet! Location wise  it might be difficult to reach if you don’t have a car. Carefully read the instructions before heading there!
24556512,Chiara August 2022 Such a great experience. Debbie is truly kind and so helpful. Would definitely recommend!
24556512,Magdalena August 2022 The site is beautiful! in the middle of nature  with a lovely view. Is an affordable way to see Corfu. We had a bit of trouble finding the location  maps sent us to another road. Once we found the right road  we damaged the car  be careful! is a bad road. When we arrived  there was no sign nor anyone to ask if we were in the right place. Luckily another guest confirmed it was the glamping site. There is little parking on the glamping  I recomend you leave your car parked on the road. The entrance of the glamping is quite steep. Maybe best to go by motorbike  we rented a small car that suffered a lot on this road. There is only one bathroom  but we had no problem with this. At night there was no light in the bathroom or kitchen. We got woken up a few times; by other guests  by a cat. But over all was a nice experience! our only issue was the road  which we didn't expect to be so bad.
24556512,Régine July 2022 Debbie and Nicholas were so kind  giving good advices and very helpful. It was really pleasant to meet such great people! We loved everything about the Olive Oasis. Amazing view and everything perfectly functioned. Sleeping and being in nature was a gift! See you soon! ❤️❤️❤️
24556512,Libbi June 2022 At Debbies’s we felt we’d come home. A beautiful place with beautiful people!
24556512,Kathrin June 2022 Debbie and her family have created something really special with this place. I left recharged and at peace. The bed was very comfortable and the treehouse offers the most amazing view over to the Mediterranean Sea. What is even more special is Debbie who was incredible welcoming and caring. She really thought of everything and offers everything one can wish for. I highly recommend staying here!
24556512,Milena June 2022 A really lovely place and very unique! Debbie and her family are really nice (as well as their dog is) and give you great recommendations for the area. Of course you can not expect too much luxury - but I thinks that’s not what you are looking for when you book this place. Everything you need is there. A lot of little details make this place really familiar and cozy. I would recommend you to rent a car to explore the area and all the great beaches! Try out the bakery and the cocktailbar (Zanzibar) in Pelekas - both are great! And don’t forget moskitospray!!!
24556512,Nils September 2021 Debbie and Toni created a really wonderful space with nice views and lots of places to chill. Also they are really lovely and helpful hosts. It was a great experience to stay in there camp!
24556512,Sebastian September 2021 Oh my god! This was the best stay we had in years! Debbie is such a lovely host  you have to meet her  to understand  what I mean: She is so dedicated to this site  built it with mind  heart and hands and is very committed to environmental protection. And you can always have a chat with her. From the tent or the lookout tower you have the most georgeous view on the sea. The kitchen is perfectly equipped with dishes  gas fridge and solar panels and even made from pallets. For all you travellers  who love to be in touch in nature  but don't want to miss out on comfort: This is your eldorado!
24556512,Alexander August 2021 Thank you Debbie & Tony !!! It was a great impression and wonderful experience of living in such amazing place !
24556512,Niklazz August 2021 nothing better  than waking up with seaview  hearing the cicades and having breakfast in the lookout tower we really enjoyed our 9 days stay at this beautiful and well-located campsite with an amazing and incredibly gracious host
24556512,Anna August 2021 I would definitely recommend visiting this beautiful place Debbie and her husband created! They both are really welcoming and always helped out when having struggles or by giving advices where to go. They provide drinking water every day  shampoo and towels and lots of love for all their guests. We stayed for 10 days and had the best time! For everyone who loves nature  wants to get away from their phone (which can charge with solar batteries though) and just relax on Korfu  I would definitely recommend going there.
24556512,Sarah July 2021 We've spent a whole week at Debbies place and definitely would recommend it! Its so beautiful! You can enjoy nature (cicada and birds are your background-playlist)   have a wonderful view at the sea from the lookout tower / balcony. Bathroom and kitchen are well prepared - in the kitchen you find more than basics to cook (lunchboxes  a lot of spices  … ). Debbie and Tony are so kind  attentive and open-hearted. They will do everything to make sure you have a wonderful time.  We did half a week without car (you can explore different beaches and restaurants  a monastery  or for example just stay half a day in the camping site and relax in the shadow of olive trees). It's about 20 minutes to walk to the beach. Also with a car it's a perfect starting point for tours in the north and south.  So if you still uncertain: Go for it! :) Otherwise you will miss something really unique and beautiful.
24556512,Lea August 2022 Highly recommended! Debbie is an incredibly warm person. She has created a paradise with her family! From communication to accommodation  which is truly heavenly  everything worked out. We will definitely be back! Thank you! Translated from German  Show original
24556512,Caroline July 2022 We had an unforgettable time at the campsite. Debbie is the kindest host I've ever met!

Translated from German  Show original
24556512,José Luis June 2022 My partner is in love with the campsites  and I've never been to one.  After the experience  I can assure you how much we have enjoyed even more than I have.  Debbie is a wonderful person and her son even more. From the first moment they have been very attentive sending us directions to the campsite. On the day of check-out Debbie surprised us with a Homemade cake to say goodbye  amazing!  Regarding the campsite  it has everything. The bathroom is in good condition  the tent is spacious and has a huge bed. And best of all  the campsite has a treehouse to make the experience even more impressive.  We highly recommend staying at this campsite and wish Debbie and her son the best.  Guti and Drew Show more Translated from Spanish  Show original

589603277750201893,Robin October 2022 My husband and I spent four nights in Nina's lovely studio unit in October and had a lovely time. We loved the privacy of the back unit  the beautiful view through the trees of the Ionian Sea and the stunning sunsets. Lots of comfy seating outside was nice  but we didn't have enough time to enjoy the awesome hammock.  Nina was an excellent host and was so helpful  very responsive and able to help with our requests. The studio was spacious with a comfortable bed and a very well equipped kitchen. Nina provided a thoughtful welcome gift  coffee pods for the coffee maker  several very useful items in the refrigerator  and a bottle of wine made by her father. We loved it! Nina also recommended a couple of great nearby beaches and two restaurants in Pentati - Angela's and The Strofi Taverna. Both were amazing.  My husband grew up in Greece  and the small remote villages on the west side of the island including Pentati and Agios Mattheos reminded him of the old Greece from his youth and young adulthood  and we spent of time exploring these and other small villages  as well as the beaches.  In short  Nina's Mantzaros House and her hospitality are top notch. We highly recommend the studio and will look for it when we return to Corfu! Show more
589603277750201893,Katrin October 2022 We had a very lovely stay in Ninas cute little house amongst gorgeous old olive trees. It was super clean and had everything you could wish for. Nina also was very concerned about our well being and checked in on us regularly via text. She even filled the fridge with some stuff for breakfast  since we arrived quite late on our first day. The garden and the view was beautiful and we had a very lovely stay  that even the mosquitos couldn´t disturb.
589603277750201893,Jason October 2022 It's a magical retreat  perched on a cliff where we could watch the sun set in the sea through the olive trees below. Nina and her family gave us the warmest of welcomes and were generous in every way. We would love to return.
589603277750201893,Carole October 2022 Nina made us more than welcome and went out of her way to make sure our stay was a moment to remember- she advised us on restaurants  beaches etc and was always available to offer advice. Cannot recommend her higher as everything was just perfect 👍
589603277750201893,Nicole October 2022 Absolutely exceptional! If every host could be like Nina  and every place as well equipped as hers  I’d live in airbnbs! I cannot wait to return. Nina (and her father) are amazing and made my time in Corfu better than I could have imagined. Someone else said that this is what they imagined when they decided to come to a Greek Island and it’s exactly right!
589603277750201893,Lydia September 2022 This little paradise gave us 2 wonderful weeks. In the middle of nature  very private and absolutely lovingly furnished  with really everything you could need. We can only confirm the positive reviews. Nina and her family are magical  friendly people who looked after us in a helpful and open manner. Nina picked us up from the airport and brought us there  so that we only had to rent a car for 10 days for 2 weeks. But you need a car if you don't go on a hiking holiday. As others have mentioned  ear plugs are recommended at night as the neighborhood roosters and dogs sometimes get really crazy. Now  back home  I even miss that😅 Dear Nina  you are the best hostess I've ever had and if I ever come back to Corfu  then to your house 🥰
589603277750201893,Lena September 2022 We spent a week at Nina’s place. The apartment is beautiful and has more than you could ever need  like the outdoor shower or the swing chair. It is very calm and there are barely no people around. Nina was the most precious host  she welcomed us and set up the fridge with some food for the first day. She was always there when we had a question and gave us information about the local food spots or beaches. We would definitely come back. Thank you  Nina!
589603277750201893,Airam August 2022 Staying at Nina’s place was a pleasure  not only is she the best and nicest host   her place is great. The view is marvelous and the house has everything you might need. Its close to beautiful beaches and to any Durrells fans  many locations of the tv show are close by  always fun to discover. Nina is probably the best host we have ever had at airbnb.
589603277750201893,Véronique August 2022 We absolutely loved our stay at Nina's lovely little house. It is amazingly well- equipped  Nina has thought about every single detail to provide her guests with what they might need during their holiday. The views are also even more beautiful than in the photos and the yard is a mere wonder.

589603277750201893,Sean July 2022 Our stay at Nina’s place in Corfu was lovely. The house was beautiful and well kept and Nina was an extremely gracious and helpful host with lots of useful suggestions. I would highly recommend it.
589603277750201893,"Bettina July 2022 The cottage is really amazing... in-between olive-trees  lovely decorated  perfectly equipped. We arrived and were surprised to find a ""first day survival kit"" in the fridge (food and drinks) - wow! It is just wonderful to sit outside and enjoy the view and the peaceful atmosphere....  Nina  the host  welcomed us warmly and gave us plenty of tipps - thank you again for your outstanding hospitality! :-)  P.S. As already mentioned there are dogs / roosters in the neighborhood - if you are a sensitive sleeper take earplugs along :-)"
589603277750201893,Aigijs July 2022 we did like our stay at this nice and cosy little home.. wonderful sunset  sea breeze right into your window  lovely sounds of cicadas  shade of olive trees.. i believe this is authentic Greece   at least this is the way we felt during our stay in Pentati..
589603277750201893,Phillip June 2022 Nina was a super lovely host which made us feel right at home  she even put some food for breakfast in the fridge  since the next day was a sunday  and prepared a little welcome gift for us. The house is beautiful and so is the view from there. Perfect for a holiday getaway.
589603277750201893,René June 2022 Nina is a great host! We really enjoyed staying in Mantzaros little house. It was really clean and perfect for two persons. We would definitely recommend it! Thanks Nina :)

589603277750201893,Franck October 2022 A place away from it all in a stunning little house amid olive trees and with sea views. If you want peace and quiet  this is the place to be  you will be allowed to enjoy stunning sunsets. The house is spacious for 2 and very well equipped with a very well-equipped exterior. Nina was really very nice with a very good welcome and some little gifts. She was a great source of advice for our stay. I would recommend this place for lovers of calm and nature.

589603277750201893,Vanessa July 2022 This place was all I needed. A beautiful little house  garden  hammock  sea view and above all a lot of nature. Large olive trees that provide shade and a large spectacle of animals and insects to watch when lying in the hammock. Curious about who will be visiting. Nina was very helpful and caring  I felt completely comfortable and safe. However  it is important to have a car to go shopping or to go to the beach. This is too far on foot  at least in the heat. Oh yes  the neighbors have dogs and a rooster. Of course  they bark and crow. It didn't bother me  but there are more sensitive souls. I highly recommend this house  the value for money is unbeatable. Translated from German  Show original
589603277750201893,Betty May 2022 Nina is an exceptional host and her studio is amazing: - very well located and easy to reach (40 minutes by scooter 90cc from the airport)   at the edge of the cliff with sea views through olive trees  secluded and quiet  shady garden and very well appointed. - the equipment provided exceeded our expectations  there is everything you need on site! - Nina is very available and generous. - I recommend the experience of a meal at Angela'sTavern in Pentati: Makis  the chef is exceptional. I would come back to Nina's without hesitation! Translated from French  Show original

We were greeted at 1am following the very late flight  and Nina was there for us  with everything you need for breakfast in the fridge! direct sea view from the bed through a large bay window  and through olive trees. Strategic location for sunsets. Nina was really adorable and attentive  absolutely impeccable welcome! The place is rather secluded and away from mass tourism  very authentic. A mini market nearby in the village of Pentati. You can come without so much as a second thought. Translated from French  Show original

It was really easy to communicate with Dafni and Sofia (her mother) really helpfull and reative. We did not know that Sofia was living near the house but it was not a probleme at all  we were free to live as we want to be and Sofia was very helpfull for all our questions and asking during the stay.  Thank you so much both of you ! Pauline"
21941910,Julia June 2022 We had an amazing stay at Da Sofia! Sofia was a lovely host and gave us great recommendations for tavernas and sights to see. Incredible views and a great space to share with a group. Thanks so much! Response from Dafni June 2022 Thank you Julia for your kind words. Hope you enjoyed your holidays to the fullest and made the best memories! See you again soon 😃
21941910,Georgia May 2022 We had a lovely stay at Da Sofia. Mrs Sofia was lovely and very helpful but it wasn’t clear in the description that she lived on the property (downstairs). The pool area was beautiful and as described but the kitchen was very under-equipped. There were great restaurants within walking distance but you’d need a car to get to good beaches. We had a fab stay and thank you for having us!
21941910,Franz September 2021 Perfect stay  thank you!
21941910,Björn September 2020 ....highly recommended!!  We had an exceptionally nice stay in the villa. The hospitality was incomparably good. (Sofia  thank you very much for your help and tips) We have rented some houses from AirBnb before (Spain  Italy  etc.) but this is where we liked it the most. You feel that it is important to the host that you have a great vacation and a great time. The house is clean  modern  spacious and well equipped. The environment is perfect for getting anywhere quickly.  There is absolutely nothing we can say negatively....  Thank you for the many beautiful moments in Corfu and that we were able to live in your beautiful villa. Response from Dafni September 2020 Thank you so much Bjoern for your kind words. We are very glad you enjoyed your vacation. Hope to see you again soon in our beautiful island!
21941910,Seleena August 2020 Amazing place - Dafni and Sofia worked well together to ensure our stay was perfect. Sofia gave us some incredible recommendations for restaurants. Thank you!
21941910,Magali October 2019 What a beautiful house! The view is spectacular and the terrace is lovely. Very clean all around. pillows and bedding could be a notch comfier and more towels could be provided at no additional cost. Would have been nice too to have basic cooking ingredients but we were welcomed with a bottle of wine which was a nice gesture. There were many mosquitos inside the house on the first night so make sure to keep doors closed at all times! Host was very helpful to all our questions and was always available to check on us as she lives downstairs.
21941910,"Oscar August 2019 First  thank you for having us and our 4 dogs. Our personal experience was not as expected  but we all are different  yours may be to your expectations. We stayed mid August  Daphne and her mother are animal lovers  just like us. However  the amount of bees in the pool area did not allow us to spend much time. We use at home a garlic product to repel  but that is to the discretion of owner. True that the place does not have ac  and that is what states  it was my mistake not to look that big detail. Also true that you may not need ac  weather-wise  but the amount of mosquitoes and bugs during our stay  and a couple of days really hot  will make you think twice. Again  to the discretion of owner is she adds ac in the rooms at least. Distances to beach and Corfu town is true in kilometers  but if you have never driven this roads  will take you twice the time. I would suggest owner to add a mirror exiting the property  so you can see the ""one road  two car"" if someone else is coming. First let me say that Sofia is a very personable person  and really trying to assist you The detail that was really inconvenience for us and host I assume  is that she lives in basement. We assumed that she was on premises (usually separate house)  normal like many rental properties  and you are never aware. Since we did not have washer as advertised or at least noted  we had to impose and be imposed  every time we needed laundry  since we had to use Sofia's. Like I said at beginning  some people will be fine with this  we like our privacy. Also  and with total understanding (she lived in the house)  she would knock on door at her leisure if she wanted to communicate  and would do her garden activities  and daily life  yes she would ask first  but then it was not our place for that rental period. If you are fine with all this  the place is great  I made the mistake of not asking the right questions before booking  and that is 100% my fault. Pelekas is a nice town  and good restaurants/cafes  enjoy it. Show more Response from Dafni September 2019 We are unfortunate that you had this experience....unlike all our other guests. nevertheless thank you for your feedback. it helps us to improve. a mirror is of paramount importance. i will contact the municipality to install one as the mirror is not part of the premises. as for bees and mosquitoes  it's summer in greece. your feedback will be taken into consideration. perhaps keeping the nets on the windows closed at all times would help as well. Sofia is at our guests' disposal at all times  in case she is needed. thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Don't hesitate to contact us for further communication should you wish to do so.  Best regards Show more"
21941910,Ruairi July 2019 Lovely villa in a beautiful location. We were well looked after by our hosts for our holiday
21941910,Taryn June 2019 This villa was even better than expected! The home is very large with a beautiful view! The pool was great. Sophia was very nice and met us in the village because we couldn’t find the house. Then she provided us with many ideas of things to do and places to eat. Her suggestions were all wonderful! We loved the visit and would come back again. We felt very spoiled!
21941910,Katie June 2019 We had a wonderful stay. The host lives on site and prepared us a delicious meal on our first night  and she also gave us lots of local recommendations which were all great. The villa is beautiful with stunning rooms and a gorgeous pool area. We’d love to come back  it’s a great base for exploring Corfu by car.
21941910,Susanne August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay in the house. The villa was very clean and furnished as described. The owner Sofia  who lives in the basement  was very attentive and caring during our stay. We did not find this disturbing  as she always asked in advance by phone if she should change towels  for example. It's on site  though  so you should know. This does not really bother the privacy of my experience. To the previous notes about wasps and mosquitoes  I can only say that everyone (!) Windows are equipped with high quality mosquito repellent. Very positive! In addition  mosquitoes and wasps were not more common than at our home in Germany. There is no air conditioning  it was not really necessary due to the exposed location on the mountain - although it was hot in August. Translated from German  Show original

For this price you get everything you need - the interior is really lovely and Anastasia has thought of everything! However  the location of the apartment is a lil bit complicated in case you have no car - then it’s not that easy to find a way in the city even if there’s a bus. But this one comes only every 2-3 and on weekends it’s a mess. Nevertheless we enjoyed the stay  thanks for everything :)
547458275363887851,Michalis July 2022 The house was very pretty  comfortable clean and at a very good location. I recommend it 100%.
547458275363887851,Paula June 2022 Clean and renovated house. It is located in a quiet place +/- 20 minutes from Corfu. However  there are not many restaurants or attractions in this area. Response from Anastasia July 2022 Nearby   in 1-2 klms there's a thematic aquapark  a golf course and places for a naturalist to see. Not to mention the lack of traffic u usually find on the eastern part of corfu. As far as restaurants are concerned  there are quite a few very close by  u probably didn't notice. Show more

The drawback is weak wifi signal (which can't be substituted by data  as there is no signal in the ground floor). The data and sometimes wifi were working in the first floor. But in general  really nice experience! :) Response from Anastasia June 2022 I'm sorry to hear about the internet connection  but it's not up to me. Internet services can be slow at times.

The place is one of the locals  which adds to the giant charm. The smells of neighboring homes are picking up and getting hungry right away. The apartment is a 5-minute drive from the stop which will take you to Glifada or Kerkira. Also  there is a cheap tavern next to it  but the food is of poor quality.

604337875585247007,Henry September 2022 We were there for two nights. Our 1 and 7-month-old son loved it there. There is chicken and sheep near the house. The first evening when it was getting dark he wanted to see sheep up close and started to scream if he couldn't go there (sheep went to the barn or away from a house)  hope we did not make too much noise while staying there.  There were a baby chair and bath which is a nice thing to have. The host and their family are really kind  they let us take a bunch of grapes and gave a gift to our son.  I would say the location is quite good. Both Lidles were 16-17 minutes car drive away from home  and there is a mini market in Pelekas but more expensive than Lidle's.  House wad everything you need  There is a TV with many channels and you can cook yourself to save money.  Recommended places near stay: Bella Vista Sunset Restaurant (book tabel advance) Paralia Mirtiotissa beach is a nudist beach  but you don't have to take close off.

604337875585247007,Sergey September 2022 Nice house that feels like home. Good and friendly neighbors. It was very quiet  the little kid calmly went out onto the playground and we didn’t really worry about him. We stayed for 10 days and it was a very pleasant time. Be sure to buy something from mosquitoes  there are a lot of them.

604337875585247007,Lukáš August 2022 Alex and his family are really great people  very friendly and hospitable. He was adaptable to our check-in and check-out time  responsed very quickly. The village house is situated in a quiet place  there is also available space for parking. The house was clean enough  well-equipped  we didn't miss anything except of a microwave but it is not a big deal. I appreciate there was an aircon  smart tv  large rooms  washing machine and fridge. We didn't have any problem  I liked our vacation in Corfu as well as in this appartment. Thank you.

21807694,Gary July 2022 Villa senses was perfect for us - three air-conditioned floors encompassing amazing views of the sea and Corfu Town from the balcony of the master bedroom at the top; a great 3 bedroom space for the adult kids on the lower floor; and a communal lounge  dining area  and kitchen on the middle floor. Garden was lovely with spacious pool area and wonderful pool itself. Plenty of places to sit outside both in and out of the sun. We liked the 2k walk down to and then back from Gouvia in the evening (you could also get a taxi/drive) with lots of nice restaurants and bars and a fabulous harbour with more restaurants/bars a little further on. It was also handy that the big supermarket was on the way back  near to where you could also catch an air-conditioned bus into Corfu Town (roughly a bus every 20 minutes).

21807694,Tui September 2021 This is a great house  perfect for groups and the pool area is stunning. It's reasonably well equipped (few kitchen items missing as well as having to buy our own wood and coal for the BBQ and pizza oven) but otherwise we had everything we needed. The location was a little remote and we definitely needed a car to just go to the shops  otherwise we organised minibus transfers through a contact recommended to us which was quite easy. The villa is managed by a property management company who were a little slow with responses when we asked queries (sometimes took hours or up to a day) but the owner was very lovely dropping by to say hello and even leaving a homemade cake!

21807694,Stephen August 2021 Don't look further  just book this beautifully  well kept villa. From initial enquiry  the very helpful  prompt and friendly responses from the owners agents were truly professional and hit the perfect note. Do use GPS coordinates via Google Maps to find the villa if arriving at night. On arrival you realise quickly that it is a stunning villa  very well kept and super clean with everything you could possibly need plus many extras. The owners clearly have thought of everything and care about their guests. The welcome parcel of goodies was very much appreciated along with a giant  home made cake that arrived during our stay  thank you. The pool was just perfect with it lovely seating areas  BBQ and shaded area and gorgeous views. Inside the aircon was effective and quiet  the beds very comfy  the kitchen very well equipped and the WiFi excellent. The whole villa inside and out is kept in perfect condition and very obviously cared for closely by the owners. We have stayed in my parts of Corfu in the past as we just love this Island and this location was excellent  being quick and easy to get into the stunning Corfu Town as well as over to the sandy beaches of the west coast and up to the lovely coves of the North East Coast. Food recommendations were very well received and we loved all of them we went to  thanks so much. The owners were so friendly and helpful and we knew nothing would be too much if we had asked. Highly recommend and hope to return. Show more Response from Sofronios September 2021 Dear Stephen.

21807694,Clara October 2019 Our holiday at Villa Senses was nothing short of idyllic. The property is stunning - I would say the interior is even nicer than the photos  and the outside definitely lived up to expectation. We spent our holiday lounging by the pool and hanging out in the amazing spaces both outside and inside the villa. The entire group (we were six but the property easily fits 8) felt so relaxed and at peace.  This was despite the fact that one of our party slipped down the stairs and had to go to hospital on the first night. From the first minute  Eos staff and the landlord went above and beyond. The landlord arrived 15 minutes after we called to help communicate with the ambulance staff  and the Eos team sent a representative to the hospital to check in on us. They also followed up with us twice in the following days on how we were doing. It was truly outstanding and beyond anything we could have expected.  The wonderful landlord and his wife also helped us immediately with any issues we had  and even baked me a cake for my birthday! This was in addition to a lovely welcome basket with local delicacies  Truly exceptional holiday. One piece of advice is to definitely rent a car: we dithered about it but truly it makes your life so much easier r.e. being able to get to Corfu Town  although there is a local supermarket which delivers.

21807694,Vicki May 2019 We had an amazing stay at villa Senses. It truly is an outstanding villa. The inside space is lovely and modern and spacious. The outside space is fabulous and the pool is wonderful. The pool is just the right size that the sun warms it up and is large enough for plenty of inflatables. The owner explained that the pool was installed last year and it looked like no expense had been spared. It was beautiful. Everywhere was spotless and the owner came half way through our stay to clean the pool. If you dont wabtvto sit in the beautiful sunshine there is plenty of shaded places to sit outside and the villa is nicely elevated to get a small breeze. The pizza oven and bbq are a bonus for alfresco dining. The view is beautiful and uninterrupted. We stayed for 5 nights and the villa was cleaned to an impeccable standard twice during our stay. Towels were provided to use by the pool  which was a bonus along with plenty if towels for inside. The Villa is gated  not overlooked  with plenty if inside snd outside space. There is a well equipped kitchen and dishwasher tablets  washing up liquid and t towels were provided. The owner kindly left us a welcome basket  which was a lovely surprise. He also came to visit us to check if we needed anything  to give us some local tourist info and brought a delicious cake. Thank you!

21807694,Luke June 2018 I’m honestly not sure where to begin. The whole experience of staying in this Villa was perfect. We were greeted by both the villa owner  his wife and our contact at Eos Travel (who rent out the villa through Airbnb for the owner) with a plentiful amount of fresh fruit  local produce  information and smiles. They were all on hand throughout the week for anything we needed  whether that was help with booking taxis or finding a hotel for us to leave our bags/ relax at on our final day (we had to leave the villa earlier in the day before a flight late at night). As for the house  it was better than we could have imagined  the pool and accompanying sofa area were incredible. Perfect for relaxing and enjoying the sun. Inside the villa  the rooms were spacious  facilities were amazing and the finish to the property is of a higher standard than I’ve ever experienced in a European villa. We didn’t choose the villa based on the interior decor but it enhanced the trip more than we realised. The villa was cleaned twice professionally during the week stay (by an incredibly conscientious cleaner) to a very high standard which is again something I’ve never experienced in a European villa but puts this property in a class above the rest. Having your bed freshly made with clean linen and the communal areas cleaned and bins emptied (as well as cleaning the pool area) certainly enhances the trip. Finally  the owner was the highlight of the trip. He was the kindest  loveliest man we met on the island and his generosity made us feel so welcome. The little gestures like showing up with an Ice Cream cake when he came to clean the pool for a second time (as we were his first Airbnb customers!) just helped solidify our love for this wonderful man! This villa is suitable for a group of friends (as we were)  or families with children  as there were things such as wooden stair gates and a gentle decline into the pool  as well as lots of family friendly activities in the surrounding beaches and towns. It had good access to the North East part of the island which is considered the most beautiful  as well as just along the main road from Corfu Town. Would 100% recommend this villa to anyone looking to visit Corfu! Show more Response from Sofronios July 2018 Dear Luke   Good evening from Eos.

21807694,Aitor May 2018 Really nice house. It has a beautiful barbacue and an elegant swimming pool which is cleaned twice or three times during the week. The house is big and beautiful. Perfect place for a group of 8 people.
21807694,Martin May 2018 The accomodation was way more than what we actually expected - especially because of all the nice people that took care of us the whole time. They were there when needed: it was like staying in a hotel as for the services  but felt like home as for the attitude and willingness. We also got a lot of great advice about what to do in Corfu. Thanks all members of the stuff for everything! Also the quality of accomodation was very very high. Love at first sight - very close to the airport (cca 15 minutes ride) and oh  the view is trully gorgeous! It is up on the hill  so the whole neigbourhood appears clearly. It has a pool long enough to take a solid swim. 🙂 Besides all of the advantages mentioned above  the best thing - for us as a group that included small children - is that the house is completely children friendly - and children-proof:-) so that we didn't have to worry that anything bad would happen. There are lockable fences everywhere - the stairs  around the pool... Almost all of the rooms have their own 'private place' - a terrace or a balcony just for the two that stay in there  but there are also four larger places where you can easily chill out together (including f. e. grilling area) - which is more than enough considering that the capacity is 8/9 people (although I think it would be comfortable for at least four more). In short: the complimentary description of the Villa Senses suits it perfectly and we'll be really pleased to come back next time.

21807694,Jeremie July 2021 Very nice pleasant villa where we stayed for 4 adults and 4 small children. Communication was great. Cleanliness also with a cleaning once a week with the owner's cake as a bonus  where we spent the day outdoors. Only small downside  the kitchen is not very well equipped with cooking utensils if you like to cook on site. On the other hand  great barbecue also cleaned mid-week  very clean swimming pool and suitable for children because there is little background. The view is lovely too. Absolutely recommended.

43597921,Colin September 2022 The apartment had everything we needed…. The view and the peace were amazing…there is a small shop and we visited two restaurants  including the family one  both were good. You definitely need a hire car to get there and the steep walk up the hill past the church leads to another super viewpoint.
43597921,Andreea September 2022 This accommodation is even more beautiful than in the pictures. The entrance is not from the main street  but from a small alley. The view of the sea and Corfu is just magnificent. We loved everything here (except the road from Agios Gordios): the village  the sunset and views  the food options. You can also walk to Agios Gordios and Paramonas if you want to exercise after too much Greek food :) The accommodation was very clean  well-equipped  the bed very comfortable and the views magnificent. It was very refreshing to have an outside kitchen and to enjoy the views while eating. Thank you Jutka and Sofi for your hospitality and helpfulness!
43597921,Gunnar September 2022 This accommodation is so lovely and has a view you'd die for! A perfect place for relaxing and observing the sunset. Jutka  her husband  and Sofi are such lovely people. They were always there for us. Once our WiFi was lost because of a thunderstorm. They managed it alright after we'd informed them. We appreciate all your efforts. Thank you very much for hosting us. We really enjoyed our stay. We would have stayed longer if our holiday on Corfu Island had not come to an end.
43597921,Julia August 2022 We had a very enjoyable time at Jutkas place. The view from the terrace is stunning and we loved the town cats. Inside the apartment you can find everything you need. Beautiful town and nice beaches within reach. Thanks a lot for having us.
43597921,Jérémy August 2022 The accommodation is spacious and clean with eveything needed inside. Located in an authentic Greek village and the vew from balcony is amazing !! Jukta is a very kind person and helped us to find the best beach spots!
43597921,Richard En Audrey August 2022 A beautiful house with an ameezing view! We had wonderful dinners at the taverna!
43597921,Aleza July 2022 It was a great experience in Jutka‘s Villa. The view is breathtaking. Very clean apartment  everything you need is there. Sofia was great help!
43597921,Brian July 2022 Place was more or less faultless. Beautiful views from the balcony. Although we are cat lovers only thing I'd change would be putting something in place to keep the cats out. Better pillows as well maybe.
43597921,Lea July 2022 This place is absolutly beautiful ! we had an amazing time and Sofia is super kind.  Please note that it is quite excentred  I would advise to rent a car or a quad (as the road are a little difficult)
43597921,Daniel June 2022 Sofia was very kind and helpful wherever it was possible :) Communication was fast and easy
43597921,Isobelle June 2022 Amazing place to stay! So peaceful and quiet with amazing views. Only thing I could say is make sure you get a bike or car to get yourself up the hill!
43597921,Guy June 2022 Jutka‘s place is as fabulous as you can expect from the pictures! We spent a lovely (but too short) time enjoying the spectacular view from the terrasse  including the sunset  and the well equipped outdoor kitchen. We also enjoyed the quiet location  the friendly village people and the local food in Pentati village. Communication with Sofi was excellent. I can highly recommend this place for a perfectly relaxing holiday stay.
43597921,Adam June 2022 Jutka’s space is the perfect place for traveling solo or as a couple. As an up front warning  it’s a little confusing to find (30-40 min drive from Corfu town) but Jutka is always available by phone if you do get lost. Pictures don’t do this property/view justice. It is honestly breathtaking and worth a stay of at least 5 days. We were crushed to have to leave after 3.  The room is clean  the kitchen is fully equipped (even has a a juicer which we made fresh mimosas with) and the wifi was strong enough to take video calls which we both utilized since we work remotely. In all  this was a lovely home to explore an even more lovely island. We will stay again.
43597921,Katja May 2022 Most beautiful place we ever stayed in. Like paradise! Super comfy bed  the view (!!!)  outdoor kitchen <3 Cutest village  nicest people  not touristy  we felt like living in the neighborhood :) Car recommended. We hope to come back one day
43597921,Julia April 2022 Villa Scarlett is perfect for anyone wanting peace with a stunning view  even from the bathroom the view is breathtaking. The place is spotlessly clean and there are lots of extra bedding and towels should you need them  everything you would require (and more) to cook meals. Although there are 2 excellent Tavernas ( one of which is no.1 on Tripadvisor) in the village within walkable distance. Watching the sunset sitting in the egg chair with that panaramic view is unbeatable  we even saw dolphins swimming in the bay. Book this place  you won't be disappointed!
43597921,Dana April 2022 Staying at Scarlett‘s Villa was a true pleasure! Sofi and Scarlett were super friendly and the Check-In worked well. The apartment was clean and waking up to that view was awesome! Pentati is a cute little village with two tavernas and a mini market you can reach in a few minutes by foot. By far one of the most beautiful places I‘ve stayed so far!
43597921,Michaela September 2021 What a beautiful and quiet place! The perfect spot for sunsets! Very comfortable bed and nice seats outside. Highly recommended if you just like looking at the sea for hours :)
43597921,Annika September 2021 THIS VIEW!!!!! The apartment is perfectly clean  has cute interior and the view is the best ever! Beautiful sunrise/ sunset! It is very secluded though  you need a scooter or car to get to the village but it’s really authentic. Two nice restaurants in the village. Communication was great  I had anlogt of questions and Sofia was always quick to answer. Thank you so much for this stay!!!
43597921,Max August 2021 We had a really nice stay. Thank you very much! :)
43597921,Desirée August 2021 Great location  absolute tranquility and very well equipped apartment! The terrace is the perfect place to wnjoy the sunset and the beautiful scenery of the western coast! Would definitely recommend the place & would love to come back. Parking was outside of the village bit was not a problem even now during high season.
43597921,Cas August 2021 very good !
43597921,Mihai July 2021 A quaint and very clean place
43597921,Johannes June 2021 Its a really nice and cozy Apartment with impressive view over Agios Gordos Bay. The terrace ist really nice and has a lot of space to eat  chill  rest.  We loved it and will come again for sure :) Response from Jutka July 2021 Always Welcome!
43597921,Gilbert June 2021 Great view. Great location for exploring central and southern Corfu. We loved the outdoor kitchen. Everything is Close by while sitting on the terrace. Great Communication with Jutka.
43597921,Isabel June 2021 We had the best stay at Villa Scarlet ! Jutka and her husband are the kindest and very welcoming. The apartment has the most beautiful view and is super cozy! It’s located in a sweet village with the best Greek tavernas and the friendliest people ! :-) We will definitely come back ! 🥰 Thanks for our beautiful vacation ♥️ Response from Jutka June 2021 Always Welcome ❤️
43597921,Nicole June 2021 This was a wonderful stay in small village on Corfu. The balcony has an amazing view of the ocean. The hosts were very nice  responsive  and helpful. I highly recommend this stay.
43597921,Jorien May 2021 What a great place!! Clean  nice shower and bed  all the things you need are there  nice small village with two good tavernas  10min driving from Agios Gordios and most importantly: an amazing view right from your own terrace! Jutka and Sofia were very friendly and helped us if we needed anything. We will definitely be back! Response from Jutka May 2021 Good Evening. You people are always welcome to Pentati. God bless both of you.
43597921,Hugo May 2021 We had a very good time in Pentati village.  The view is stunning  the bedroom is all you need to relax. The place is a bit tricky by road but you can find beaches  restaurant and any kind of activity for less than 20 min ride by car.  The host are very friendly and quiet  and can be of any help if needed.  We really recommande this stay.
43597921,Margot September 2020 The apartment is all you need! Perfect view  perfect host and perfect equipment! Located around 35min to corfou center  it is perfect with a rental car.  Thanks jukta for your welcome in Pentati!
43597921,Thiana September 2020 This place is a beautiful place to stay for a few nights. It’s a small place but very comfy and sparkly clean. The view is amazing and it is close to the beach. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. It was a joy to stay there!
43597921,Denis August 2020 It was the best stay of all Airbnb’s that I have. The owner was ready to help everytime and gave us tips to travel and to eat. The place is fantastic in a very quiet and safe area. stunning view! Super! Just one advice: maybe so write down on the airbnb page the local coordinates or the meeting point before check in (Café bar and bus station or in my opinion it will be better to meet at a place that google maps has like one of the tavernas for example. Good food in this area as well. It was a fantastic time. The equipment of the room was perfect. Even towels  drinks  Desinfektion ... was available. Thank you for everything ! Would come again if I visit corfu again.
43597921,Thaneshan August 2020 It has magnificent views from every corner of the house. Jutka and her husband are very helpful and provided useful hints on travelling around  eating out and buying things (fruits  vegetables and daily needs). Pentati has it own beauty of quite surrounding and friendly people  one could also try some traditional food there  and buy local products like vegetables or eggs from local shop at Pentati. I had a wonderful stay there  if I will have another opportunity to come back to Corfu  I’ll definitely think about stying there again.
43597921,Annika August 2020 Amazing view and perfect for sunsets!!! Great outdoor space!! Super nice little village with two restaurants  we only visited one of them because we fell in love with it the first evening  so there was no point of checking out the other. :) We rented a Scooter so we could go directly to the house but if you rent a car you have to park it on the Main Street and walk for like 2 min. Only annoying thing are the wesps but they are everywhere and not that aggressive. Also Jutka gave us some stuff against them so it was fine.
43597921,Kate August 2020 Jutka's beautiful place and the incredible view from her balcony made our trip to Corfu. We enjoyed the peaceful vibe in Pentati and left rested and happy. Response from Jutka August 2020 What's important to me is that my guest enjoys their stay. God bless ! Translated  Show original
43597921,William July 2020 This place is very peaceful and the view is splendid  jutka and his husband are so sympathic. I recommend this place.
43597921,"Annette October 2022 A jewel in the absolutely quiet ""panoramic zone"" of the mountain village of Pentati far from the tourist hustle. Here  the Greek village life still works: a mini market and 3 taverns are available! We ate extremely well especially with Sofi and her family at ""I Strophi"".  Various beaches are easy to reach as a hike or by car. However  it is also recommended to rent a car (as small as possible!) at the airport.  We will be happy to come back!

43597921,Samuel August 2022 We recommend this accommodation 200% with my partner  a superb apartment with a breathtaking view like we have never seen in our life  the accommodation has all the possible and expected options to feel good  a beautiful village and a note to tell you that the host Sofia is a great person with a heart on hand  who holds a restaurant a few meters away or we eat in an excellent way  with a very wide variety of dishes and a family atmosphere. Translated from French  Show original
43597921,"Jessi May 2022 Reviewing the apartment is not so easy  if you would rate the terrace on your own  you could smoothly distribute 10*. It doesn't get any better than this. The apartment itself is more of a ""room""  measured by a standard hotel room with shower. It is functional and has everything you need. The kitchen has been placed to the outside. We had 14 days of great weather and so also enjoyed the time with the outdoor kitchen. In bad weather it becomes difficult  but when do you have it in Corfu? The communication with Juttka was always very fast and if you had wishes  these were quickly fulfilled. Parking in itself is not available in the village  as is common in the mountain villages  you have to squeeze yourself somewhere to the side. The two tavernas in the village are highly recommended  with Angela's taverns being a little more quaint. You can choose to eat in the kitchen and the host is super hospitable. ATTENTION  one should be mentioned. There are several cats in the house that you can't escape  they are sweet  but if you don't like that they are there all the time or have a cat allergy  you should consider this well. Because of the terrace we had fantastic hours and experienced enchanting sunsets. All in all  a beautiful accommodation in a mountain village with the best views ""ever.""

50967191,Alexander October 2022 we can highly recommend Dimitra's apartment. if you want to relax and love the sea  this is the place for you. Dimitra is a very friendly and personable hostess. 5 Stars!
50967191,Naomi September 2022 A wonderful experience in Corfu! The house is wonderful! Perfect location  clean and tidy. Dimitra was thinking about every small detail  helped us with every question  and were available every time we needed her. The hospitality gave us the feeling of visiting a good friend and the room high maintenance made us feel like in a five stars hotel  Hope to come back soon!
50967191,Kinga September 2022 Dimitra’s place was one of the most amazing places we stayed in. Adding up Dimitra’s great heart this is the must stay location. It’s just right next to the beach  has an amazing view  and the sea is just few steps away. It is so close to the beach and sun beds yet you have all privacy you may need. Just right the corner there is a restaurant where you may have nice dinner and in a short walking distance you have few small markets. All you need is around. When we came Dimitra welcomed us  showed the house and told all the details regarding the neighborhood. House is so well equipped that all you need is your clothes:) If you are starving after a journey no worries - Dimitra also took care of the welcoming food:) All thought out. All the small and big things that are done by this host made us feel great. From the flat furbish and equipment to the process of welcoming and saying good bye to the guests: everything was great. Thank you Dimitra!!:)
50967191,Yannis August 2022 saying everything was perfect is an understatement! thank you Dimitra you are the best host!!!
50967191,Anna August 2022 Dimitra is a very kind person who took really care of us. The apartment is brand new rebuild  the terrasse is well furnished  everything was prepared for us four  even food for the next day as we arrived late on Saturday night. The apartment is convenient as it gives on the beach. The beach is very big  quite wild  really worth it  with restaurants along the beach and one very trendy.
50967191,Johannes June 2022 We spent our Honeymoon at this beautiful apartment and had a fantastic time. The apartment is even more beautiful in real as the pictures can show. The garden is beautifully taken care of and offers an amazing view and you can be at the beach in no time. The beach is very beautiful and sandy and was not too crowded during our stay in June. Great restaurants are near by and the beach also offers lots of water sports options. Dimitra is the nicest host you could imagine  she gave us many great tips for sightseeing  restaurants  beaches and so on and really helped us easily find the best spots. The apartment was very clean  and is very stylish. If it gets too warm the AC works great. We would stay here again any time.
50967191,Charlie June 2022 Our stay exceeded expectations from the second we arrived to the second we left!  Before we even arrived  Dimitra was so helpful and responsive with questions we had about our stay. When we arrived we were greeted and shown around. The apartment was very clean  and the views were amazing. Dimitra and her parents have thought of everything that we would possibly ever need! The thought of traveling with a 14-month old was slightly overwhelming  but our hosts made it as easy as it could be. There was a baby bath  shampoo  toys  a cot and blankets for her.  The location itself is amazing! Just 30 seconds from the beach was perfect with a baby.  All in all  our stay was perfect and we have been recommending it to everyone we know! We would jump at the chance to stay again.
50967191,Christoph June 2022 We had such a great time at the Melody house. It is so close to the beach that you hear the waves from the living room. The house has everything you need and it’s so beautiful watching the sea from the terrace. Dimitra and her parents are really nice people. We stayed there with our 5 months old son and they had everything we needed for our baby like a baby bed and a small baby bathtub. And they even bought baby books just for our little baby. So nice and attentive. The beach is beautiful and not too busy. Great for a relaxed family holidays. But you’ll better have a car for restaurants and groceries shopping as the places on the beach are too expensive and not so good. But you can find good restaurants in Pelekas only 10 minutes by car and Corfu town is not that far neither. We highly recommend this house. Thanks Dimitra and Georgia for the hospitality!
50967191,Juste May 2022 Apartments was really wonderful! Lovely place to stay for calm holiday with a family or friends. Everything was great-place  beach near apartments  garden and especially many thanks to the host! Thank you one more time! :)
50967191,Daniel November 2021 the location is wonderful  but you should have a rental car. the accommodation is as described in the pictures and so we are very satisfied.  the hosts are friendly and there were even a few small gifts. we would come back anytime  which is the biggest compliment.
50967191,Uladzislau October 2021 A wonderful and stylish house. Everything is done with taste; there are many things for your comfort (even a flashlight for walking along the shore at night  board games  toaster  etc.). The hosts are very hospitable and friendly. When they asked for ideas for improvement  we couldn't even find an answer. The sea view is lovely  thanks to the terrace you can enjoy it even in bad weather.
50967191,Charlotte October 2021 I am not sure what is better - the location or the apartment. The property has been beautifully renovated and every last touch has been considered. From the bed linen to the garden  the beach towels and beach gear to the cooking utensils  games  sun loungers  deck chairs - you name it  it is there. There was water and fresh fruit for when we arrived and two umbrellas including one for our toddler as there was some rain forecast. The host went to such trouble for our little one  a lovely little cot ( not travel cot)  bath products and towels / linens for her and a new high chair…really we were blown away. And the apartment is literally on the beach. The sound of the waves  out the gate and you are in the sea in a minute. The hosts father dropped off some home made red wine which was brilliant and they were all so welcoming and helpful. I could not recommend this place highly enough for a single  couple or couple with a little one. It really is a little piece of heaven.
50967191,Devlin September 2021 We loved our stay at this special spot! Dimitri and her family are great hosts and the location was perfect - from verandah to swim in about 10 seconds! The photos listed are just what we experienced.  Everything was very comfortable and clean with good quality bedding and towels.  We appreciated the extra attention to detail in the beach mats  umbrella and kitchen extras and toiletries. Our host even dropped off home made wine 🙌🏼  We will never forgot morning coffees in the deck chairs and sunsets out of a postcard.  Thank you!
50967191,Will August 2021 This place is what Airbnb is all about. It is an amazing place which has just been done up to the highest standard. The garden is amazing. You never really need to leave other than to walk the 10 metres for a swim. The beach is great here and the sea is beautiful and calm. We stayed with our 9 month old and it was perfect for her. Demetra and her family could not do anymore for us and even bought a little toy for us. It is right next to a really nice restaurant. There is a decent shop with all the essentials and fresh bread in the mornings. A little down the beach there is a beach bar that is more lively with an amazing ice cream place behind. Overall we had the most amazing week here and would recommend it to everyone. Such a special place!
50967191,Thies November 2022 Dimitra is a wonderful host and she also catered to our children. Her apartment was very comfortably furnished and very clean. The location is perfect because you can't get any closer to the beach. In November we had the beach almost to ourselves. With the rental car  you could drive well into the city for shopping and dining. Translated from German  Show original
50967191,Boaz September 2022 Dimitria's place is the perfect place for a family vacation. We were with little kids and the apartment was incredibly equipped for us. Games for children Sea equipment Light refreshments and a bottle of wine. Dimitria's mom even dropped off her souvenir shirts for the kids from Corfu. Excellent tavernas in the nearby village. Thankyou so much Dimitria for an amazing stay. Translated from Hebrew  Show original
50967191,Bárbara September 2022 The apartment is beachfront  you go directly to the sand. Super well equipped inside  it has everything and everything works perfectly  and the owners add everything you can imagine (small appliances  water and fruit  personal hygiene products  even some toys for the children!)

23939683,Nadja Eva July 2022 was very nice :)
23939683,Chris July 2021 We occupied the ground floor unit for a week  which includes a seating area to the front of the house  but not the lovely rear garden which belongs to the first floor apartment. The place was clean and well equipped  and we enjoyed eating outside watching the village life. there are some derelict units on both sides which might put some people off but semi derelict buildings seem to be everywhere in Corfu  as are feral cats. We really enjoyed our stay. The locals are friendly and you can walk to the bars and restaurants and so on. you'll need a car  and therefore nerves of steel to navigate some of the minor roads. overall we had a great time and would heartily recommend this apartment Response from Ioannis July 2021 Thank you  Chris  and thanks for taking such good care of the house  also! We are happy you and your family enjoyed your stay at my place and in Corfu  but it's a shame you didn't get to enjoy the backyard at all. It isn't exclusive to the other apartment and maybe we should put a second table and chairs to make it more obvious. Hopefully  if you return  you' ll enjoy it next time! ☺️ Show more
23939683,Felix July 2021 very nice place Response from Ioannis July 2021 We are very happy you enjoyed your time at our place and I hope we see you again!
23939683,Oisin June 2021 I don't know if the stay at Ioannis' place could have been better. The welcome from his family  the warm conversations  and the beautiful terraces made my month-long stay a dream. It was very laid back  very easy going  and had everything I needed. Response from Ioannis June 2021 Thank you so much  Osh  for your kind words! Looking forward to meeting you ourselves next time you come and spend some time together  as well! 😊
23939683,Joanne August 2020 Ioannis is indeed a superhost! Communication fantastic  helpful tips for the area & apartment and he even picked us up from the airport. We had the ground floor apartment. It has a big terrace at the front which gets the wonderful sun in the morning. Also a quieter rear terrace at the back. It’s a spacious apartment with very efficient Air con. Lots of storage space  big fridge freezer (inside they left us some wonderful home made jams and a bottle of homemade wine) washing machine if you need. Great shower. Everything you would need. Ioannis parents were on holiday too staying in the apartment above and were also super friendly even baking us an apple pie cake.... just lovely.  Location is in the village centre with restaurants & bars literally up the street. Pelekas has several great restaurants so make sure you follow the road up & around the hill. Amazing 360 degree views from the Kaiser’s chair at the top and THE best place to see the sunset from the restaurant next to it.  A few beaches close by to the town (we went to Pelekas beach) and they had bars/ restaurants on them for lunch/ drinks & plenty of sun beds. Be warned it is a very steep road down to the beaches. It is walkable in good shoes (25 mins?) but the walk back uphill is a little hard going in the heat. Perhaps rent a scooter or a small car? Parking is possible down the road from the apartment too. Bus into Corfu town is cheap & efficient - departure times are random & many changes because of Covid so check local notices. Get your bus ticket from the shop around the corner and it’s cheaper.  All in all we loved the mountain village of Pelekas and would happily recommend and return. Show more
23939683,Aaron August 2020 Ioannis's apartment is brilliantly located in one of the most beautiful villages in Corfu. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything you could need. The terrace overlooks the bustling main street of the village and you can even have your dinner delivered by the Pelekas Grill next door. We decided that we definitely had the best table in Pelekas!  Ioannis gave us some great tips for places to eat  beaches etc and we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with him and his wife. I'd have no hesitation recommending a stay at Ioannis's apartment. Response from Ioannis September 2020 Thank you so much for your enthusiastic review! We were also very glad to host you and your family and hope we have a second chance to meet again at a covid-free time  where we would be able to have a bbq competition! 😉 Best wishes to you all  Yannis & Fani.

23939683,Christa September 2019 Even we were in this appartment only 2 nights we had a great time there. the appartment is really nice  lot of space  a wounderful garden and also a really nice sitting area in front of the house. and on top Ioannis was one of the best host we ever had. one highlight we didnt expect was spending an evening with him  his girlfriend  aunt and uncle with lots of great food and interesting conversation. And also the fridge was filled with nice things to eat. we can really recommend this appartment and would love to come back. Pelekas was a nice little village with lots of restaurants around. but we really recommend a rental car for getting arround. Response from Ioannis September 2019 Thank you so much for all your kind words! It was also a pleasure for me hosting you and although I understand you don't usually return to the same place twice  it would be great to see you again sometime (maybe when Julian is a little older...)! Happy travels!!! Show more
23939683,Krzysztof July 2019 Ioannis's apartment is located in Pelekas - beautiful little town on the western part of the island. There are a few restaurants in the city  bakery and the small (a little overpriced) supermarket. It's a good starting point to visit the whole island  especially part on the west side of the coast. Plenty of little cute beaches in about 20 minutes by car.  The place itself is well equiped  all rooms have AC  there is a wifi connection as well. Apartment is based on the ground floor  though is a little dark but in 30+ celcius degrees this can be a plus for some people. It has two cute terraces that you can use by yourself - one from the front  the second one in a very nice private garden. Everything is provided  so you get full equiped kitchen (Ioannis provided us some water  snacks and fruits)  there is an iron board with ironing machine  washing machine and beach umbrella with few mats. Overally I would recommend the place if you want to enjoy local Corfu village life and you rent a car to check the island. Convenient location  big space that can easily accommodate 6 people  air conditioning and few little touches from the owners. Efharistò Ioannis! Show more Response from Ioannis August 2019 Thank you Krzysztof for your nice words! I'm happy you enjoyed your stay at my place and explored everyday a new Beach! See you on your next visit to Corfú! Best wishes!

23939683,Timm September 2018 We had a great Week in the House. Ioannis is a great Host. We are looking forward to come back.
23939683,Chloe September 2018 Enjoyed a relaxing week at Ioannis' apartment in the centre of Pelekas. The outside space is what really makes the place  particularly the beautiful terraced back garden. Ioannis is a friendly and helpful host and Pelekas is a great place to stay without a car. You can walk down to the lovely Paleokastritsa and Glyfada beaches (the walk back is definitely good exercise!) and up to the Kaiser's Throne for a stunning sunset view (especially good with an ouzo or Mythos). And Corfu Town makes a good day trip on the bus. Hope to return one day!
23939683,Lauren September 2018 Ioannis's place is located in pelakas which is about 30 mins away from the city of Corfu. it's a cute little area with everything you need   much quieter than in the bustle of Corfu. the apartment has everything you need. I would definitely recommend staying here! I would also recommend trying pelakas grill 2 doors down for the most delicious gyros!
23939683,Claudio August 2018 I came to Pelekas with my wife and my children (4 and 2 years old). Everything was just perfect: the house and its fittings  the location and  most of all  the host! Ioannis has became a real friend: for personal reasons I had to report my holidays the day I was supposed to arrive at Ioannis' place. He had been absolutely helpful and did everything to not make lost my reservation. In addition  we had a fantastic time chatting with him and his wonderful family  we even got invited for a fantastic Greek dinner together! The apartment is very comfortable and has two different outdoor spaces with tables and chairs where you can enjoy your meals. Of course the house was clean  beds comfortable  air conditioned in the bedrooms... what more can I say? I would recommend this place over and over again! I have now some very good friends in Corfu! Thank you Ioannis!
23939683,Simon August 2018 Ioannis's flat is very well located in the centre of the village. There are shops  cafes and ATM very close by. We did not have a car but were able to get around very easily. The beach is walkable from the flat (about 20 minutes downhill and a bit longer on the way back) and there is a great viewpoint above the village which we walked to. There is also a good bus service to Corfu Town from the village. We really enjoyed our stay in Ioannis's flat. It is spacious and has two lovely outdoor eating areas - one in a very nice private garden at the back of the house and another at the front of the house looking out over the village. The air-conditioning worked well and we were very comfortable. Ioannis was an excellent host - he met us and gave us lots of useful local information and some very nice homemade biscuits  but also gave us plenty of privacy. Response from Ioannis September 2018 Thank you Simon  Jo  Sam and Katie for taking the risk to book my house without earlier comments! As I understood the place exceeded your expectations and I am very pleased hearing that! One of the project's plan is to host families with kids and yours was a good test. The lack of a car did not bother you because your family has an adventurous spirit and you had the chance to explore the nature around Pelekas and also the culture and local history of Corfu. Thank you for your kind words regarding me. I try to be discreet  friendly and helpful with my guests. I am looking forward to seeing you guys again and hope we 'll enjoy a barbeque at your next visit !!! My mother is happy that u liked the jam and she says that has more home made jam to offer to you  and my uncle is waiting to give you a tour at the museum of Mon Repos  the birthplace of prince Charles.

23939683,Carlo August 2018 This home is BEAUTIFUL  and it’s in a wonderful location right in the middle of town. There’s plenty to do and see and you are never far from the action day or night. Ioannis is the perfect host. He was there to greet us and was super helpful. We ended up spending a few nights drinking wine and chatting  and learned a lot about Greek culture. I highly recommend staying here! Response from Ioannis August 2018 Thank you Carlos for your kind words. I am very glad you liked the house and my company! I also enjoyed the nights we spend in the front yard chatting like old friends. Next time you come  we will test what you both learned about Greece. I am looking forward to seeing you soon Carlos and Cristine! Show more
23939683,Julian JuJu July 2018 Loannis was an amazing host. Helpful  respectful and very kind. Even welcomed us with Homemade wine & Fresh Fruit. House was clean  and the A/C offered in both rooms was a nice touch battling the hot summer days. Corfu is a small village with an amazing community that really embraces you as their family. Lots of great local restaurants to choose from and a beach located 5 mins from the house. Great view of the sunset at the top of the village. The centre of Corfu Town is approximately 20 mins away and about 25 mins away from the airport. I highly recommend staying here 10/10 Response from Ioannis August 2018 Thank you Julian for your nice words for my house  the people in the village and myself! I am glad that my hard work  renovating the house  satisfied you. Now you know the reason so many people visit Pelekas constantly the last 50 years. Ιts great that the appartment made you feel part of our micro-society. I hope I see you guys next summer !! Show more
23939683,Nikolay July 2018 Ioannis has recently renovated the first floor of his house which is right in the centre of the village Pelekas. Thus one can admire the movement of the people there while sitting on the spacious verranda. We particularly enjoyed the restaurant that is next door but first of all the hospitality  flexibility and open-heartednes of Ioannis. He met us personally on arrival and was waiting for us at 2 o'clock in the night ;-) Thank you Ioannis. Response from Ioannis August 2018 I thank you Nikolay for choosing my place and your comments. I wish all following guests will behave like you and your family. I am glad that I met you guys and I wish we had more time to discuss several issues that would bring us closer. I will be pleased to accomodate you again. Show more

It's also very well located  20 minutes to the centre of Corfu Town and very close to many tremendous beaches! We can't wait to come back at Ioannis place!

23939683,Anita Joseph June 2018 If you are a traveller  you value hospitality  cleanliness and value. Of course  having the perfect holiday location is the most important. The Village of Pelekas has the most beautiful of Corfu's summer sunsets over a sandy beach. Yes  sand! The apartment is located up the hill from the beach and receives pleasant breezes throughout the day and night. Breakfast in the back garden  under the lemon and kumquat trees  with the fragrance of jasmine  and sip a glass of wine while people-watching on the large front patio gardens in the mid-afternoon  and before an evening trip to the beach. We had 5 in the apartment and plenty of privacy. A fully stocked kitchen and many nearby restaurants  cafes  bakeries and markets helped us while away the evenings with delicious food and great conversation with friends. Enough comfortable outdoor chairs for 12! Bring good walking shoes  because you will to explore. Our host went to great lengths to add small touches that make a big difference  but nothing can replace how friendly  responsive  honest and inviting he is. House rules to remember: Rinse sandy shoes outside and be gentle and respectful with appliances and fixtures. This was a family home and the fine dishes are generously provided for tenant use. Air conditioning in every room and good water pressure in the shower are added features that we didn't find at other lodgings. A washing machine and a drying rack (plenty of sun) was also helpful. The life is easy in Pelekas and we immediately felt like we lived there. There are regular buses to Corfu town and a tour office by the bakery  but we really found everything we wanted in Pelekas. We will definitely return to this place  again and again. Book early! Show more Response from Ioannis June 2018 Wow Anita !!! Thanks for your superb words and all info/rules that you provided. I am greatful to guests like you and your family. Looking forward to seeing you !! Show more
23939683,Nuria August 2022 The flat is the first floor of a house  with a front porch and back garden  in the center of the village Pelekas. The bedding was very good  with the kitchen and bathroom fully equipped. It has supermarkets  bars  bakeries and restaurants very close to which you can walk. The beaches are very close  beautiful and not very touristy. The host was very attentive to us  he had prepared jams and sweet wine for our stay  he correctly suggested several restaurants  beaches and places to go. It is a village and a house to recommend.

23939683,Peter August 2021 A wonderful apartment on the lowest floor of a three-storey house. We stayed in the middle of the nice and authentic mountain village of Pelekas. In the front a large terrace to watch the village life. On the backside is a wonderfully green garden that smells of herbs. The apartment itself was super clean. Only the one or the other piece of furniture could be renewed slowly.  On the top floor Ioannis' uncle lives with his family - extremely nice people!  Pelekas is perfectly located to reach the whole island - in a few minutes you can reach the great beaches of the area and in 15 minutes you are in the city  at the ferry and at the airport. Despite the high season  we usually had the parking space in front of the house - or close by. We had a really wonderful holiday - not least thanks to this perfect place to stay. Translated from German  Show original Response from Ioannis August 2021 Thank you very much for the detailed and detailed review and the information very helpful for other guests! My uncle  as well as the whole family  were also very happy to have met you! And  yes  we are seriously planning the renewal of certain items  because we believe the apartment will be more comfortable and will do so this year.

23939683,Hans-Georg October 2020 We spent 14 wonderful days in the house of Iannis in the middle of Pelkas. We had the whole lower floor of the house as well as the huge terrace in front for us and in addition seating in the back of the garden. Everything in the house was perfect. In addition to the usual service  there were homemade jams  homemade wine  water  coffee  tea  milk.... for us. The location is ideal for exploring the island even without your own car. We have reached three beautiful beaches on foot as well as the capital and other villages and beaches by bus. We would come back any time  possibly even with both grandchildren  the second bedroom we do not use is perfect for that. Our favorite place to stay was the sunny large terrace in front overlooking the sea towards the city.

23939683,Shanshan August 2019 This is a lovely house  the apartment is on the ground floor  sharing the front and rear gardens with guests upstairs  enough privacy and interaction.Comfortable room  clean environment  fully equipped  even condiments and medicine  we felt very convenient to cook our own meals there.In particular  the host is very welcoming. Due to the difficulty of renting a car  they picked us up from the airport to the house and invited us to a dinner that night  then offered to take us to the beach  help us with car rental and advice on places to visit.The recommended Chlomos and the beaches👍 in the south are very nice. The location is very convenient to go anywhere on the island by car  and it is easy to walk to the Kaiser King at the top of the hill to watch the sunset  so it is great to have a drink there for dinner.However  it is still recommended to drive to the nearest beach because it is a wonderful experience to walk along the trail of Banshan in the heat of the sun on the way back. Overall it was a very happy stay and both the owner and the house itself made it unforgettable.

53642777,Marco September 2022 Had a Great Time. I can highly recommend the accommodation! Beautiful view and nice Pool area. Just sometimes a little windy.
53642777,Josephine September 2022 Wow  what a villa 🤩  If you a contemplating booking then hit the button as this is an absolute gem!!!  The villa is gorgeous  with everything you could hope for. It’s spacious with lots of communal areas for a group to lounge around in  The pool has sun all day long  with a couple of covered areas you can sneak off too when it gets a bit hot  We didn’t hire a car and in hindsight I would 100% recommend you do. The villa is very high up a mountain with steep windy roads all the way down. If you are unsteady on your feet it may not be the best place for you if you don’t have a car  You can get taxis  but they are very expensive…about €20 euros per trip  which soon adds up (especially if you need more than one)  We’d recommend either going shopping in corfu town on the way from the airport as there aren’t any big supermarkets close. There are some small ones which have all the essentials  but they are pricey  The bedrooms were big with comfy beds and plenty of bathrooms. We were a group of 6 and had lots of space  Rita and her husband were excellent hosts who did everything they could to make our holiday special  All in all we had the BEST week away and would certainly return Show more
53642777,Ben August 2022 An amazing place  beautifully created. Every amenity and comfort has been thought about. We really couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. The location is perfect too - very close to Kassiopi and San Stefanos - in between the two. But with great shops nearby as well. Rita was incredible at looking after us  and helping us find our way around the local area. We would highly recommend this place to anyone. Perfect for both families and adults alike. We would book again in a flash (if we can find availability!).
53642777,Lisa August 2022 Amazing villa which has been beautifully decorated. The owners were very helpful. The location is perfect and quiet.
53642777,Jonas June 2022 Rita did the suggestion and also reservation for our boats tour  which was awesome! Also the house looked in reality even better than in the pictures  what is really difficult. Rita was a very great host!
53642777,Virginia June 2022 We had the most incredible stay at Sinium Villa. The Villa itself was so beautiful and had absolutely everything you could possibly need. The views are spectacular. The pool was incredible and well needed after some Corfu sun. Rita and George were amazing with information and made us feel so welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. You will definitely need a car (and one with a good clutch!) as the surrounding area is worth exploring and the hills are windy. We hired a boat from Agni Bay and that was a must-do experience. We walked down to Agni Bay a few times too but if you want a drink then you’ll need a taxi home as the hills are very steep back up! One of our best and most relaxing holidays ever.
53642777,Frederik May 2022 Absolutely amazing house with a stunning view and nice hosts. Astrit and Rita have created a truly perfect holiday stay. The house has everything you need for a nice relaxing week away. Everything was clean and in great condition. We hope to be back soon!
53642777,Felix October 2022 For my family and friends it was an impressive time at the villa. The morning sunrise over Albania  the sunset behind our house slope  the starry sky with several shooting stars  the pool area with all-day sun  very secluded and therefore very quiet to relax  breakfast and cooking in a super equipped kitchen  the luxury with a private bathroom in the sleeping area (3 of the 4 bedrooms have a shower room)  the romantic bathtub in the 4th bathroom. The ambiance and design of the interior of the house exudes so much love and passion. This is where the builder has thought about it. The lighting concept is also impressive and invites you to linger. You need/should rent a car! It makes a lot easier and more comfortable. I would shop at Lidl's in Corfu city  as the mini supermarkets are very overpriced! Wine and snapps can be found 10 minutes by car from Vino & Spirits - the selection is impressive. Rita and her husband are very loving people who do not leave you in the rain in case there are any problems. They were so engaged and accommodating to make our holiday something special!

24190849,Aidan August 2019 This is a beautiful villa which although part of a complex feels very private with wonderful views of the beach and sea. The part of the beach it overlooks is not busy even in peak times. The villa was spotlessly clean and well equipped. Hanna was very amenable and helpful. Why only 4 stars? - unfortunately there is a beach bar further up the beach that plays music between 4 and 8pm which is an annoyance  except on special events when it continues until 11pm and can be very noisy. Despite this I would still definitely recommend the villa. It was wonderful to get up in the morning for an early morning swim in the sea and to an empty beach.
24190849,Katharina September 2018 The house  garden and location are amazing!!Perfect for a relaxing holiday directly behind the sandy beach and with an incredible view over the sea! we liked it a lot! hanne is very friendly and makes everything possible (Babybed  babychair)Thank you!!

24190849,Eva October 2020 The beach house is situated in a beautiful bay with crystal clear water. We stayed here at the end of October and had great sunny weather. Swimming was a joy at 25 degrees water temperature. A stand-up board is part of the house. In the bay there is also a water sports rental  a small souvenir/grocery store and 1 restaurant. However  a rental car is definitely useful  as the bay is quite remote and the real shopping facilities are a bit away. The beach house with its garden is nicely decorated and there is nothing missing. We were able to relax superbly  enjoy a fantastic sunset every day and would come back any time.

From your own lawn you can go directly into the sea  which is flat and equipped with the best sand. On site there are 3 tavernas and a club  but it is much nicer in Pelekas  which goes up the mountain by car 5 minutes! Hanne was very nice and explained everything to us.

17978846,Andreas July 2022 Alexandros is without a doubt the most kindhearted and down to earth Airbnb host I've ever dealt with. He facilitated our stay and helped us with everything we needed to have a perfect time in Potamos. The house itself is stunning and has a natural connection to the beautiful nature surrounding it. To anyone looking for a well-managed house with a super professional host  I highly recommend this Airbnb!
17978846,Edwin July 2022 The house really has got everything you need to make your self comfortable. The pool is lovely and the airconditioning works well. The club  supermarket  public transport and beach are all within 20 mins of walking from the house. Next to that Alex is a great host who is willing to help you out with everything. We enjoyed our stay a lot.
17978846,Mark June 2022 The house is above and beyond what you expect and see from the pictures. Its a fantastic place to stay  and our group had a fantastic time. The location is great for party-goers as well with easy access to the bus stop to get into the city  and walking distance from some of the hottest clubs/bars in Corfu.  Alex is an incredible host. Very generous and understanding. He was very easy to contact throughout the whole trip and was quick to help us or give recommendations whenever we needed.
17978846,Fabio September 2021 This is a really sweet home near Corfù  that can comfortably fit 9 people. It's roomy and clean  with a nice well-maintained pool in the backyard  a big BBQ grill in the front yard... and a pool table that we used way more than we expected to. There's a TV and AC in each room  the ones in the living room and in the backyard are smart so you can also sign in with your Netflix or Disney+ account in order to watch the movies or TV series you like.  We rented some scooters  using them the house is about 5 minutes away from Corfù city and 20-30 minutes away from some beautiful beaches. I'd honestly recommend scooters over a car as they're more agile  you can more comfortably navigate through the small greek streets.  Overall this is a very good choice if you're looking for a place to stay with your friends in Corfù. Alex is also a very nice person  he immediately answered the many questions I had and went out of his way to solve the little problems we had. Recommended!
17978846,Alania August 2021 Alexandros is the kindest and most relaxed host you will ever meet. He was always available for help. From the beginning on he helped us to organize everything we needed. He even gave us a ride to supermarkets and a car-rental place. He gave us lots of great recommendations. The house is so cute and has everything you need. When you are bored you play a round of billiard or go swimming in the beautiful pool. It is also very cozy and clean. It was the perfect location for our trip  we would recommend it to everyone!!! 12/10
17978846,Sabrina June 2021 This property was exactly what we were looking for! It was 6 of us  staying for 8 days and we really enjoyed it. Alex is really an excellent host. He made us feel welcome and takes great care of the property. The pool was excellent and the billiards table was another great bonus. I would absolutely recommend this house to everyone visiting Corfu.
17978846,Ben September 2020 Alex was great. So helpful throughout our trip  and the villa itself is nice with a good pool. Only 10 minutes or so in a taxi into Corfu town  so a decent location too
17978846,Thorsten August 2020 We had a really good time at Alexandro's place. Everything was great  the house is clean  spatious and has nice pool. Easy to explore the island from this place. Much recommend!
17978846,Viktoriia August 2020 Alex is very helpful. The villa is great! Very quiet place . Location is superb  very close to city Centre and beautiful beaches. Excellent value for money.
17978846,James June 2019 Alexandros is an excellent host with a splendid place. It was the perfect house for me and my 5 friends to go and chill out for a few days in Corfu while we take in the sun. The pool is the perfect temperature and we never got bored with playing pool or watching the smart TV. Although the nearest shop is 15 min walk away  it’s nice to stroll though the area and get some exercise. Alex answered all questions we had and made sure we had everything we needed to make the stay the best it could be.
17978846,Md Shafiqur April 2018 The property was very spacious clean and secure. The house had everything we needed. We had 5 children and they all loved it because of the extra space. The host Alex was very helpful and always was only a phone call away. The property was a bit of walking distance from the local transport/bus route. Nonetheless  it was a pleasant walk and we didnt mind. Alex provided us with initial drinking bottle waters as tap water was not drinkable. He also brought us further bottle waters during Easter holiday as we were not able to buy any from local shops. Alex was efficient in terms of picking us and droping us back to the Airport. We enjoyed our holiday and will recomend our friends and families without hasitation.
17978846,Andreas October 2020 Alexandros was a great host. The accommodation corresponded to the information we were very satisfied Translated from German  Show original

11996314,Ella September 2022 Lovely house with beautiful views - would definitely recommend. The hosts were friendly and communication was quick and easy. I would try to stick to the larger supermarkets instead of the small local ones - very expensive :) Angi Bay is beautiful and full of lovely restaurants too.

11996314,Elle October 2021 Villa Regina was perfect and had everything we needed. Spectacular views from the pool looking down towards Agni bay. We ate at all the local restaurants and highly recommend nikolas tavern for dinner and Korina’s kitchen for breakfast or cocktails. It is a very steep walk back up the hill but worth it! After renting a boat Agni bay is definitely the best bay along the north east coast. Response from Sofronios October 2021 Dear Elle.

11996314,Lucy October 2020 We loved our stay at Villa Regina  we spent lots of time chilling in the villa during the day at enjoyed bbqing in the evenings. Going out of season meant most of the restaurants in Agni were closed  however we made friends with the locals in Kalami who were really helpful and gave lots of recommendations! We didn’t rent a car which worked for us  however the walk up to the villa is very hilly so might not suit everyone. Be sure to visit Super Mario and Dimitri’s!

11996314,Amir October 2020 The pictures do not do good to this place since the view and outdoors is by far more amazing. 1 remarkable thing you'll understand when you are there = the infinity pool is designed exactly in the shape of the BAY itself ... amazing....simple architecture at its best ❤️ Response from Sofronios October 2020 Dear Amir  Hello from Eos Villas.

11996314,Asaf September 2020 If you come with kids  don’t go there. Too many stairs and the access is very dangerous. The villa divided to 2 separate houses. Without door between- not comfortable. The bathrooms are disgusting. Water didn’t flash.
11996314,Zivile October 2019 To be short and precise we have really enjoyed our stay at Villa Regina. It gave us memorable moments while sitting outside in the evening and looking into the sea. View was magnificent and relaxing one. Also I want to emphasize that route into this villa is not the simplest one  but you will get used to it quite quickly. It has some steep hills and some sharp turns  but it's manageable. Parking space is quite narrow so consider renting smaller cars as I don't think you will place bigger one there or at least it will be some kind of a game to do that. Villa has everything you need for your stay (they even managed to get us child bed and chair). House has two floors  but they are not connected from the inside. We have considered this as an advantage - it gave some intimacy for our family. We haven't had any issues except the fact that in the last evening hot water disappeared on the first floor  but it wasn't a big deal. To sum up it was a good stay and we had a great week in Villa Regina. Response from Sofronios October 2019 Dear Zivile   Hello from Eos Villas.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

11996314,Ian September 2019 This villa has possibly one of the best pools and views of any place we've stayed in  we liked it so much we stayed there twice. The location is lovely  above Agni Bay  it has a large terrace around the pool but it is not as secluded as we like  as it is overlooked by a neighbouring property and the pool area is open to the road and can be seen from an adjacent access path  though neither are especially busy. The road to get there is quite narrow  winding and steep in places and the parking could feel very awkward for non-confident drivers. The house itself is comfortable and well-equipped but has a tricky layout  being on two separate levels with the largest bedroom in the annex by the pool. The kitchen and lounge are well designed  we personally found the style of the bathrooms and bedrooms a bit old-fashioned but everything worked well and we spent most of the time outside anyway. The management team were very responsive and acted quickly to address any problems we had.

11996314,Sylbert April 2019 We had a very lovely stay. The pictures don’t do this place justice. The highlights are the pool and the views from the property which are both outstanding. The bedrooms are a bit cozy and the layout is a bit awkward as one of the double bedrooms is separated from the rest of the house and has its own separate entrance. This didn’t bother us as we didn’t need a third bedroom. But the property is very well equipped and in excellent condition. Stefanos was really good with comms all the way through  the let was very professionally managed and our check in / out was pretty seamless. Would not hesitate to recommend. thanks guys for an excellent stay. Response from Sofronios May 2019 Dear Sylbert   Hello from Eos Villas.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

11996314,Jane September 2018 Wonderful location overlooking Agni Bay with its 3 Tavernas and cocktail bar within an easy walk from Villa Regina  although you need a little fitness to walk back up the hill! We loved our week and walked to Kalami  the next Bay along regularly to top up supplies from one of their two private supermarkets and to enjoy their Tavernas for fresh orange juice  meals and beach/sea activities. We did our main shop at Aldi  on our way from the airport. We had noted from previous reviews that there were no basic essentials provided which we felt was a pity - having to purchase all essentials and then leave them assuming that the next guests will not benefit. Have asked that this be reviewed. We would love to return to this perfect location and comfortable Villa. Response from Sofronios September 2018 Dear Jane   Hello from Eos.

11996314,Doug May 2018 We have had a wonderful stay at Villa Regina  if anything the photos don’t it justice! The location is gorgeous  the very steep drive up to the villa is a bit nerve wracking but you get used to it  and it’s totally worth it for the incredible views. The local tavernas are all lovely  our favourite being Nikolas taverna for its great atmosphere and food. The nearest shop is about 1.5 miles away in the next bay  it’s well stocked with basics but we did a big shop in the Lidl at the airport to get stocked up. We hired a boat from Agni boats one day which is a must do  also had days out to Paleokastritsa and Corfu Town which we can highly recommend. The villa is spotlessly clean and having a housekeeper half way through the week was appreciated. It has plenty of amenities  it would have been handy to have a small amount of salt  pepper and oil but that’s a minor thing. The communication was quick and clear  we couldn’t be happier with that. The age range of our group was 11 to 67 and we have all loved the holiday  so much so that we will probably rebook for next year. We couldn’t get over the incredible pool and stunning view  we’ve all fallen in love with it and can’t wait to come back! Response from Sofronios June 2018 Dear Doug  Hello from Eos.

11996314,Michael August 2017 The villa is a very nice building with a super pool and a beautiful view. The prices are rather high for the service provided. The owner of the house  which showed up every second day  was very impolite and did not threaten us as welcoming guests. The agency should provide further services as a daily maid  pick-up and drop-off from the airport or a personal welcome with a walk-through the villa. Our stay was ok  but definitely not a good price-value-ratio.

11996314,Alex May 2016 The photos don't really do the view from Villa Regina justice  they are breathtaking. The Villa itself is lovely. It has only recently been refurbished and was clean and well presented on arrival. We loved every minute of our stay here and didn't want to leave! The location is very remote so I would recommend a hire car to get around. Agni bay itself is lovely with three Taverna's to visit and boats to hire.

The pool and the view over the bay were amazing. There are also many ways to sit together. Since the upperand lower floors are not directly connected  you have to walk around the outside  but that is okay. The property is quietly located  so we recommend a rental car.

51213052,Carley November 2022 Angel’s house is a wonderful  cozy seaside cottage. We went during rainy season  and although many restaurants nearby were closed  we had all of the beaches and tourist sites to ourselves which was amazing! The rain was not too bad and there was plenty of sunshine every day too. Hearing the waves all day is such a treat. Highly recommend!
51213052,Andy October 2022 I would recommend staying at this property.
51213052,Liz September 2022 The most wonderful place in an amazing setting. We loved being the only people on the little beach  and having lunch on the terrace. The house is perfect! Sadly the taverna was not open but there are a couple of others nearby which were good. We cannot get over how kind and friendly the Greek people are. We would highly recommend a stay here.
51213052,Paula September 2022 We truly love this place! The view and the sound of the waves is amazing! The room is cozy and perfect for a couple. I have never stayed anywhere that was this close to the water. There are good restaurants nearby and all of the places we ate at were delicious. Next time we travel to Corfu  we will definitely stay longer! Thank you  Anastasia  for being such a great host!
51213052,Andrew September 2022 you have to stay here  the location is amazing  the studio perfect and the little touches left by the host are perfect!
51213052,Vincent September 2022 What an amazing location  right next to the sea. Waking up and having breakfast at the terrace is lovely. Good support from Anastasia also.  One thing that you need to take into account is that the AirBnB is next to the road  earplugs are recommended if you don’t like the noise of (sometimes) passing cars. Even though I rate this AirBnB 5 stars because everything makes up for that. Highly recommended place.  We also had a lot of tourists asking us if the place is for rent.
51213052,Sharon August 2022 Beautiful place  perfect location. So many little extras was given to us by Anastasia to make our stay perfect. My only wish was if we could have stayed longer!
51213052,Zuzana July 2022 Fully recommended great place for a couple or two friends you can’t go wrong
51213052,Harriet June 2022 Beautiful location  such a nice and quiet break. The restaurant across the road was stunning as well as all the other local restaurants we visited on our trip. The sound of the waves as you fall asleep is incomparable. Worth every penny!!
51213052,Trudi June 2022 Absolutely paradise !  The views are absolutely amazing  listening to the sound of the ocean from either laying on the bed inside or sat outside gave this particular property the edge over anything else we came across on this island.  Your literally steps away from snorkelling in the clearest of oceans.  The property is very well equipped and the host on hand if needed but also gives you complete privacy throughout your stay.  It’s everything the reviews say and more   comfy bed  great air conditioning  very clean  powerful shower and loads of outdoor space.  The restaurant directly across serves amazing food and excellent hospitality.  The host provides many little unexpected touches (so very kind and generous)  We highly highly recommend this place it’s an absolute gem!!!  Thank you so much Show more
51213052,Karen May 2022 To wake up in this lovely space and experience the sun rising on the Mediterranean Sea from your private terrace is only one of the specialness of Avaotaoia’s bungalow on the sea. Originally  It was Nikos’ master fisherman grandfathers's bungalow that they have visioned into a lovely cottage on the sea. A very thoughtful stay with all the necessities and more with special garden and added treats! I have stayed at many Airbnbs that do not go this distance- down to the soft sheets and cosy blankets  slippers and heat/air conditioning and view  view  view! The kindness  generosity and love in this sweet bungalow is felt from the first second you see the home. I traveled solo and felt safe and private and delighted to be in a more low key area. To walk right down the road by the sea was peace filled. There was tea and nespresso machine and great set up for cooking and eating on the huge terrace. I especially enjoyed sipping wine from the porch swing and lovely garden with olive trees over 100 years old. But why cook when you can go to the cousins George and Elena’s taverna right across the street for fabulous food and kind hospitality? I especially recommend visiting the traditional village Chlomos in the mountains   a UNESCO site. So many stories and treasures the kind people of Corfu share! You will fall in love with this host family  their sweet private bungalow home and this side of the island!!! Show more
51213052,Fabienne October 2021 All in all we had an amazing stay in Angel’s House! It was very clean and surprisingly we got some welcome gifts like croissants  one red house wine and so on. The terrace looked exactly as it was shown by the pictures on AirBnB. It was simply beautiful. The house itself was very clean and it had everything one could be asking for. Even though we got to say that we were really lucky with the weather  since the house itself is kind of small and we can imagine that if you can’t go outside because of rain  it wouldn’t have been such a wonderful vacation. Nikos was very kind and showed us everything at our arrival. The view and the garden lights were just another highlight of this little „Angel’s House“.
51213052,Nikita September 2021 The place is located right on the water. It feels private - if that’s what you’re looking for from a vacation home.  The owners are lovely people; constantly taking time out their day to ensure your comfort.  Right in front the house you’ll find an incredible authentic Greek restaurant.  This is definitely the spot to choose for your holiday. 10/10
51213052,David August 2021 Anastasia is the sweetest and best host you can ask for! Charmingly kind and super helpful in every way  we felt absolutely welcome from the beginning on and left with a big smile at the end. The place itself is magical- clean  spacious and quiet  beautifully equipped and designed to relax. Small surprises and a big  beautiful bunch of flowers for my girlfriends birthday made it a unforgettable experience - thanks so much  we will be back soon ❤️
51213052,Lahcen August 2022 Great stay  everything was perfect . The house is well equipped  it had everything you need and then some .

51213052,Dennis May 2022 Super nice terrace where you like to spend the morning and the evening. The directly adjacent beach is also ideal for lingering during the day. It's much nicer in person than in the pictures. Ohropax are recommended  as the house is directly adjacent to a road  but is not bad any more. Generally a place to stay highly recommended.

Had a great time at Angels House  will definitely come back! Translated from German  Show original
51213052,Christina August 2021 We had a great week in the small cottage by the sea. The location is unique and the view from the window in the morning is like a photo wallpaper.

2548093,Jane October 2022 These are fabulous apartments to stay in . The location is superb very beautiful and very quiet. The accommodation is well equipped and very clean. Nick and Anna are fabulous hosts. Nothing is too much trouble. We give 5* all round and will definitely be returning to Messongi
2548093,Antonia October 2022 Staying with Nick and Anna was just perfect. You have a fantastic view of the sea and in the cozy apartment you have everything you need for a relaxing beautiful holiday. The terrace is indescribably great  you wake up and see the beautiful ocean! The communication with Nick and Anna was great  they are the best hosts we have ever had - When my boyfriend had an accident  Nick drove us to the hospital and helped us with everything. His calm and kind demeanor put me at ease  I seriously didn't know what else we would have done without him.  All in all one can say that it couldn't be better and we recommend this gem to everyone without a doubt! We will be back definitely!
2548093,Nicola October 2022 We stayed for a week 2nd to 9th Oct in a ground floor  sea view studio. Everything was just perfect  fab location  great communication from Nick  studio was spotless with nice furnishings and the best sea views. we were lucky to have a week of perfect weather  Corfu is a beautiful Island and Messonghi provided a lovely relaxing week with great Tavernas and a few nice bars. lovely to meet you Nick  we will definitely stay again.
2548093,Holly October 2022 We had a great time at Galini Beach! The location right on the shore was brilliant and Nick and Anna were lovely hosts.
2548093,Catherine September 2022 We had a fantastic stay at Galini beach studios  the location and the apartment are beautiful  with the sea just on the doorstep. Nick and Anna are very kind and welcoming hosts. Communication was excellent and they responded to any queries immediately. As well as spending time relaxing on the terrace and swimming in the sea  we enjoyed exploring the surrounding area on foot  and eating out at the local tavernas. Thanks again Nick and Anna  we look forward to visiting again!
2548093,Laura September 2022 Amazing location and great accommodation  the sea is on your doorstep! Far enough away from the hubbub if you are looking for a quiet break  it’s a 5 minute walk into the village which has everything you need including some great bars and tavernas. Nick and Anna were fab hosts
2548093,Andreea Christina September 2022 Stunning stay. Close to everything you need. The fact that you have 10 steps to get into the sea is amazing. Very comfortable studio. Very good communication
2548093,Julia August 2022 Wow! We had such a great time at your apartment. Everything went just perfectly - from communication  to check in  corfu tips and check out. We enjoyed the view  the sea  the private area and most of all the sunrise every single morning. The kitchen had everything we needed for a great breakfast on our terrace and we even cooked at night because we loved hanging out with that beautiful view. Definitely one of our best Airbnb experiences :-) thanks!
2548093,Annabel August 2022 Great!
2548093,Heather July 2022 Anna & Nick are wonderful hosts and everything we asked about was respsonded to within 5/10 minutes. They gave us advice on tavernas  taxis and buses around the island and came to help us with the oven hob within minutes of my message. The location was amazing and everything you need is just down the road: the general market provided all the bits and bobs and all the traditional greek tavernas were minutes walk away. I’d recommend not going to the village centre for food as we personally found the best tavernas were outside the village and still only minutes walk away (Fisherman’s Haunt  George and Elena’s  Zak’s). We couldn’t fault our stay with Anna and Nick and couldn’t recommend them enough!
2548093,Gianfilippo July 2022 Literally a stone's throw from the sea! Woderful!!
2548093,Alana June 2022 What can I say…..this place is absolutely amazing! We stayed here for 5 nights and only wished we could have stayed for longer. The location is stunning. Our room was a sea view on the 1st floor  and we certainly weren’t disappointed! You only have to step out of the back door and you have your own private little area right on the beachfront. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The suit was spotless and had everything we needed. Situated a very short stroll away from the town centre  where you can find an array of beautiful little taverns to eat in. If I could give this a 10 star score I would! Anna and Nick were amazing hosts. We can’t wait to return!
2548093,Lily June 2022 Perfect apartment and location if you're wanting a chilled  relaxed holiday. Nick & Anna were very helpful and friendly  answered any questions quickly and arranged an airport transfer for us. The kitchenette is ideal for making your own meals as well as lots of food places nearby. I would recommend 75 steps (if you don't mind the walk - the view is worth it)  Romeo's (especially for the moussaka) and the gyros at Korali snack bar.
2548093,Salvatore May 2022 It was an Amazing staying  we really appreciate the apartment and the kindness of Anna and Nick who answer very soon at evey question you have. They recommend me also to rent a car really close the apartment with a discount for the guests . I ve just notice that If you would you like to spend the holiday in the northern beaches   this is not the place for you because the road in Corfu are not very comfortable. ( around 1.30 h)
2548093,Hannah May 2022 Perfect room  perfect location  perfect host - We are definitely coming back. If you want to go to Messongi  you should book your Galini Beach Studio ! :-)  Galini Beach Studios are such a nice  peaceful place. We rented a scooter and visited many places in Korfu but were always looking forward to return to the Appartement. Spent hours on the terrace.  Also Messonghi is a very cute village  nice restaurants  supermarket.. everything you need.
2548093,Lincoln May 2022 Nick is one of if not the best host I have ever had. The view was perfect  everything was comfortable and Nick was BY FAR the most helpful host I have ever had. Just an unbelievable trip and Nick and his room made it a perfect 10/10 trip.
2548093,Mollie May 2022 Absolutely fantastic place to stay  the pictures don’t do it justice! Incredible location and such an experience to stay so close to the sea. The terrace is a fantastic addition and a great way to spend a relaxing day. Nick and Anna are the bests hosts and we couldn’t have asked for anything more! Perfect place to stay!
2548093,Madeleine May 2022 A perfect gem of a place to stay in a beautiful on the beach location. Quiet  but with local shops  bars and restaurants minutes walk away. Room was excellent with lovely en suite  self catering facilities (although we loved eating out) and views to die for. The pleasure of stepping from your bedroom to your own private patio for breakfast then a few steps more to beach is very rare and special. Attentive hosts who were just a few minutes away if we needed anything. We'll be back asap!
2548093,Wendy October 2021 Nick and Anna are excellent hosts  their quick responses and helpfulness prior to our visit was really appreciated during these challenging times. Thank you Both.
2548093,Julian October 2021 Absolutely perfect. Apartment directly at the beach with a private beach and lots of chill option (hammocks  etc.). Nick is a lovely  carrying host and we would definitely come back.
2548093,Kelvin September 2021 Wow wow wow… where do I start….  This place is a little paradise set within its own private terrace which leads onto the beach.  The rooms are spotless and very modern with amazing views of the sea.  Anna and Nick are such lovely people. They could not have been more helpful and really went out of their way to name sure we had a great holiday.  We hired a car for the week and parked two houses away in Anna’s Mam and dads (who are also really friendly and her dad is so funny and made us laugh every time we seen him)  Honestly don’t look any further if you want accommodation in this area…. It’s top class 👍👍 Show more
2548093,Lucie September 2021 Comfy apartment with very beautiful sea view. Great communication with Anna and Nick. Highly reccomended.
2548093,Jule August 2021 We had a wonderful stay! Everything was perfect (the apartment  communication and of course messonghi!). We had a little problem with the tap in the bathroom  but Nick helped us immediately in the middle of the night. I highly recommend the studios for your stay  the town is great (not too many tourists and really nice restaurants) there is a bus line to corfu-town and the messonghi is well located to reach other spots on the island (maybe you should hire a car for 2-3 days to see the best ones!) Thanks for everything  we will come back! :-)
2548093,Lukas August 2021 We had such a great time staying in the Galini Beach Studios. The apartment was in a good location: more than close to the sea + restaurants & super markets near by but over all not to busy and touristy. Nick and Anna were amazing hosts - super friendly and helpful with everything we asked for. We will surely come back! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2548093,Marco August 2021 Everything was perfect. At anytime again!
2548093,Ella July 2021 We’ve just returned from our 10 day stay at Galini. Perfection is the only way to describe it!  From the moment we booked Nick and Anna made us feel so welcome! They organised our transfers and provided all the information on the area we could need. We even had assistance booking our COVID tests  the process was very easy and not stressful at all.  Our room ( Ground floor sea view) was perfect. Very well appointed and it had everything we needed. We feel so lucky to have found this gem of a place!! Our expectations were completely blown out of the water. You are literally steps away from the crystal clear sea  relaxation is completely guaranteed here.  We can’t wait to return to our new favourite place in the world.  Nick and Anna  we can’t thank you enough. Show more
2548093,Stuart October 2019 My stay at Galini was excellent - The place was not only clean and well kept  but also in an excellent position near/on the beach (depending on tide!) and on the sea front. Nick was extremely accommodating and the place is regularly cleaned (4 times a week or so) with new towels and the bed made up. Also  it is really easy to get to and from the airport (Lord Travel/Holiday Taxis do pre-arranged 45 mins bus travel to a bus stop 5 minute walk away) and near shops (a small supermarket is near the bus stop) and some nice restaurants (I recommend the one on the corner near Aquarius Hotel/bus stop called Village Taverna Marilena). All in all I can't recommend Galini enough and I would stay there again if I visit Corfu again (likely).
2548093,Michele August 2019 Great location  great room  great communication  even better than the pictures. Lovely small resort. Would recommend with no hesitation.
2548093,Shannon April 2019 Having a seaside view from your window and a place to lay in the sun at your immediate doorstep makes this place exceptional. Great value for money. The town nearby is quaint and has access to the basics with nice taverna's down the way. Nick and Anna were generous enough to upgrade us to a larger suite and were both there to show us to our room upon arrival. Response time was exceptionally fast and we always felt well taken care of. Wouldn't hesitate to come back.
2548093,Gal April 2019 Amazing place on the water. Great host!
2548093,Mārtiņš October 2017 Location is very good. The best restaurant i just 5 min walk away by seaside. If you prefer to read a book there is the best view for it on terrece.
2548093,Steve June 2016 My wife & I stayed in one of the first-floor sea view studios for a week – and I can honestly say it was probably the best studio-type accommodation we have ever stayed in - and we have been to various Greek islands several times in the past. I had been inclined not to give a rave review because we want to keep this little gem to ourselves but it just has to be shared – it’s that good! As many reviewers have said  the pictures are entirely accurate but don't do it full justice – it is in a really great location – right on the beach. Nothing could beat getting up with the sunrise and walking downstairs  across the terrace area and diving straight into the water for a swim. Snorkelling is also great and there are plenty of different fish to see even in relatively shallow water. It is quiet and peaceful  yet only a short stroll into the village with a full range of shops and there are bars and tavernas  many of them on the beach and with excellent views. There is a quiet bar / restaurant right next door to the studios if you’re feeling lazy and there are also several restaurants within easy walking distance outside of the village if you fancy exploring. The room was really well equipped and had everything you would need for self-catering – and we often had breakfast and the occasional lunch there. The interiors are well-designed and the furnishings and fittings were all excellent. The room itself and all the other areas around were spotless and cleaned regularly The bedlinen and towels were also changed frequently. We were going to hire a car to explore the southern and south-western part of the island that we haven’t been to before and then we were going to hire a speedboat for half a day to find some deserted coves and beaches – but you know what  we pretty much stayed put – it’s such a great  relaxing place to be – and we really enjoyed our stay there. Nick and Ana were excellent hosts – nothing was too much trouble and no query went unanswered. When the sad time came for us to leave  they even booked a taxi back to the airport for us. We can’t praise them highly enough for such well thought out  excellent accommodation and for being so helpful  approachable and friendly. Many  many thanks – we’ll definitely be back! Show more
2548093,Antonia April 2015 We had a fantastic week in Corfu. Staying in the sea view studio (ground floor) was a perfect decision - we loved to have breakfast on the terrace just 20 meters away from the sea! Everything was perfect.
2548093,Silvia October 2022 A little paradise. Anna and Nick's apartment is just as you can see in the photos  on the contrary  even better  more spacious and comfortable in our case. Perfect for a quiet and romantic vacation. Nice restaurants and a small market are within walking distance. The sea in front of the house is transparent and wonderful with nothing to envy to other beaches on the island  although bigger and more popular. September is an ideal time  even if it's a bit risky. We weren't very lucky because of persistent clouds and some rain. Recommended. But move ahead because it's always sold out! Translated from Italian  Show original

1210550,Rickie-Lee September 2022 Amazing. We will be back. Not much more to say. It was so perfect! Clean and quiet and beautiful. You hear the waves from everywhere! The restaurant closest is the best with melt in your mouth octopus. At the other end there is a Play ground and pool for kids close by too. Family of 3 with a 2year old. The safety  security and privacy the hedge provided is amazing. We could kick a ball and relax not worried about anyone escaping  jumping or throwing things off anything. Wonderful and 0 complaints. Exactly like in the pictures.
1210550,Sandra September 2022 We had a lovely stay at the accommodation. It is perfectly located near the beach with a lovely yard and privacy. We didn’t miss a thing  the apartment was very good equipped. Thank you Victor!
1210550,Amanda June 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Victor’s apartment with our two children (18 mo & 3yrs). The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed  and a cot & high chair & beach towers were all provided.  For us  having the garden was a huge plus and meant we could still sit out whilst the kids were asleep/napping. It also meant they had plenty of roots to run around when we weren’t at the beach.  The best bit however was it’s location  right on the beach and a few minutes walk to a couple of tavernas and mini market. If your after nightlife this isn’t your place but I would definitely recommend to any families with young kids.
1210550,Donnacha June 2022 Helpful and responsive. A great seaside location.
1210550,Isabelle May 2022 Stunning location just at the beach. Little cute house with everything you need… Excellent! We will come again….!!!
1210550,Ashni September 2021 Had a lovely stay. The apartment is in the perfect location  a stone throw away from the sandy beach and is well equipped for cooking.

1210550,Mylene August 2021 Well equipped  fantastic location  and beautiful view!!
1210550,Sergey July 2021 Small but cozy home in the best location in Glyfada. The perfect place to relax while gazing at the sea or the stars. A couple of steps to the beach. The best local restaurant is also nearby. The villa is located a little away from the crowded part of the village. Thus  you get an almost private beach  peace and privacy. To live in Glyfada and travel around the island  you will need a car. This village is ia little difficult to access due to the winding mountain road. But this is a great place for a relaxing stay. And Victor is a very responsive host. Would definitely recommend the villa for a stay.
1210550,Eric October 2020 Glyfada beach is a great place to stay. The beach is and the green cliff backdrop is amazing. Unfortunately we had pretty mediocre weather for late September. Victor is a very attentive and nice host. He is not around but answers all questions immediately. The place is pretty small but perfect because it’s directly at the beach. It’s amazing to wake up and fall asleep with nothing but the ocean. Make sure you store your precious stuff in the safe. We were missing two rings after our first days. Someone must have sneaked in secretly without us noticing. But I don’t blame neither Victor nor the cleaning staff. They were all extremely trustworthy. All in all I can really recommend the beach and Victors house. And we surely will come back. Response from Victor October 2020 Dear Eric  Thanks for your email and feedback. I am sorry to hear again about this incident you are mentioning however no one has sneaked in the house secretly as you are saying  We are renting this villa for the last 10 years and we never had an issue like this. Our staff is trustful as you are mentioning and the lost of the 2 rings that you are saying happened before any person came to clean the house.  And let me add the following points:  -You have asked as for the key of the safe that you have received from the begining of your stay ( don t understand why you did not put them in the safe).  - I have offered you to call the police for the incident that you are mentioning but you have refused.  - And there is no trace of any offence in the house. The house is exactly as you you have received it.  I stay at your disposal for more information you might need  Best regards  Victor Show more
1210550,Paul August 2020 The villa is perfect for a family holiday on one of Corfu’s finest beaches. A well equipped kitchen made self catering easy. Lovely light  clean space right on the beach.
1210550,Diana June 2019 Don’t miss this outstanding place for your vacation with beloved ones! With our two girls we adored the place  the view on the sea  the sea sounds and the great conditions in the house. We will return!
1210550,Alexey June 2018 This is a great place for a family vacation. The house is not big but everything is at hand. Beautiful view and near the magic beach.
1210550,Alexey June 2018 This is a great place for a family vacation. The house is not big but everything is at hand. Beautiful view and near the magic beach.
1210550,Selini & Joram June 2018 We are a family of 4 with 2 small children. We absolutely loved the house. The styling is great and the house comfortable. There were some toys available. The location is the best and convenient. Glyfada is beautiful. The 4 restaurants are good. We had fun at the beach bar Pazazu (great food) and loved the view at the Glyfada restaurant. The 2 mini markets are pricy but supermarkets are near. Nearby beach Pelekas (Kontogialos) also has great bars and restaurants. For us it was the most perfect holiday. We would really recommend it for families and also couples or friends. Thanks Victor!
1210550,Susanne April 2018 We spent a great time at Victor's house. The location and the view to the beach was wonderful.
1210550,Adi August 2017 המקום בדיוק כמו שבתמונות. נקי ומתוחזק היטב. אבזור מלא. נמצא על אחד החופים היפים בקורפו.. למי שמתכנן להישאר בעיקר במקום אחד זה מקום מושלם
1210550,Elena August 2017 The apartment was clean and as we arrived there was everything we needed (water  tea  coffee  soap). The cleaners came every other day  changing the towels as well. The Kitchen was vey well equipment and the the apartment was located right on the beach with a beautiful and very picturesque view. The location was perfect for exploring the island  also it was next to Pazuzu( a famous beach bar/restaurant)  and Pelekas village(10 minutes with the car) with really nice restaurants. Response from Victor August 2017 Thanks Elena  And hope to see you next year
1210550,Galina June 2017 The villa is as described. Amasing view and garden. Cool at night. Always shadow at the terrace. All needed is provided. The owner is very nice and helpful. Although he lives in Athens he provides assistance. He even left botteled watter in case we arrive too late to buy some. I have only one remark. Victor is not the owner bit arranges renting the place via airbnb. Communication with him was easy Response from Victor June 2017 Dear Galina   Thanks for your nice message. A small clarification. I am the owner of the house. The person you have spoken in Athens is my father Marios Camhis who is also the onwer of the house with me  Have a nice day  Victor Camhis Show more
1210550,Anastasia September 2016 Victor is a great host  contacting us with instructions and suggestions prior to arrival. There was everything in the bungalo we needed when we arrived: water  tea  coffee  soap  detergent  a much needed first aid kit. The kitchen is very well equipped with nice china  new appliances  pots and pans and very sharp knives. The children were happy to discover toys and a bag full of beach toys. Wifi glitches were sorted promptly  Victor got back to us straight away. The cleaners have missed their first visit but came every other day after that. The bungalow is located right on the beach in a secure compound. The area is beautiful and very picturesque  but lacked restaurant options and the beach wasn't the cleanest we've seen. Location was perfect for exploring the island.
1210550,Antonina September 2022 We had a very nice stay at Victor's house! The property is very well equipped  the terrace is great for breakfast  sunbathing and staying. We would definitely want to come again:-) Translated from German  Show original

1210550,Biju October 2018 If you prefer a relaxing beach vacation in an apartment/bungalow to a hotel complex  Victor's accommodation is excellently accommodated. Even if the apartment is not particularly large  it is always sufficient for 4 people. The service takes place twice a week. The apartment is cleaned  the towels are changed and all necessary things such as soap etc. are filled if necessary. Within the apartment there is a table in the open plan kitchen-living area with 3 chairs and a couch. On the covered veranda there is a dining table for 6 people as well as several beach loungers  an umbrella for the beach as well as play equipment such as children's shovels and bins for the beach but also a beach ball set  etc. Even a football gate was available to assemble. In front of the terrace is a garden whose hedge borders directly on the beach. This gives you a wonderful view of the sea yourself and is protected from views from the outside. In the immediate vicinity are shopping and dining options such as a mini market  restaurants or a beach bar. Not far within 4 km there are excellent taverns with very good food for children as well as adults. The apartment also has a kitchen including all the necessary utensils that self-catering guests will not miss. The information provided by Victor is extensive. We recommend a rental car  as this clearly facilitates the accessibility of the taverns in the surrounding area as well as excursions to the sights or another beach. We can fully recommend the place. It should be taken into account that it is not accessible. We stayed there for 10 days during the autumn holidays at the beginning of October and had very good weather except for one morning and an afternoon. Swimming in the sea was easily possible with the children even after sunset  as you are quickly back in the house due to the proximity to the beach. The apartment has a private outdoor shower  so a quick shower after the sea water is always and quickly possible. It should be noted that the waves are quite strong  so surfers will also get their money's worth and we had a lot of fun in the waves. Show more Translated from German  Show original

1210550,Mehran September 2017 It was a very nice relaxing vacation right on Glyfada beach. Place was very good. Viktor had previously explained everything in a detailed guide with tips. The house is very well equipped and you have everything you need. Sparkling water was already provided for our late arrival (02:00)  which was great. Shopping is possible nearby. The terrace and the small garden are very well maintained and you have a beautiful view of the sea. The beach practically at your feet. In the first days Glyfada beach was very restless with high waves (beginning of Sep.)  which I personally like  but also with rain and storm (1 day) the landscape is a delight. In the last few days the water was calm and the sea wonderful for snorkeling. There are also reasonable restaurants right on the beach nearby. The mountain village of Pelekas can be reached by car in 10 minutes  we were there 3-4 times  highly recommended. Kerkyra 1/2 hour  a great city. Overall very relaxing  quiet and stress-free. We will be happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original
24365804,Andrea October 2022 We had a great time in Pelekas. The house has an excellent location almost directly on the beach  and the view is beautiful. The house is basic but has all you need!
24365804,Reinhard September 2022 We had a fantastic stay in Corfu and the house was perfect for what we had been looking for. The photos really do not do the location justice  the apartment is so close to a sandy beach and had a nice  quiet restaurant close by. There is great parking (hire car definitely recommended) and the whole check-in process was very easy. Mixalis were very easy to contact and kept in touch throughout the stay. This really is a rare find!
24365804,Martin August 2022 This is a nice house close to some restaurants/ bars and the beach. We had a few smaller things that needed attention  but were quickly solved by Dimitris (thanks a lot!). You will need a car to reach the place and also to travel around as you might want some variation from the local beach. We were there in high season which comes with a big number of daily visitors and traffic on the small road right next to the house.
24365804,Elena July 2022 Nice house and awesome view. Helpful and kind hosts .
43821880,Aicha November 2022 wow best host ever🧡 it was wonderful- and we felt like family with nina and her family! what lovely people! thanks thanks- full of love... and the house was super cozy and good energy to relax and rest... fcherista for everything... inchallah we will see you again... love and light to you🙏🏽🦋🙏🏽🧡
43821880,Marenka October 2022 Nina's house is a cozy gem in one of the most beautiful areas of Corfu. Surrounded by ancient olive trees and quiet beaches  there is almost no traffic on the nearby road. In the kitchen  bathroom and bedroom you will find everything you need to feel good. Nina is an enchanting host  she took care of us with lots of good advice and fulfilled the few wishes that were still open (print out boarding passes). We would come back anytime  thank you for your hospitality dear Nina!
43821880,Eran September 2022 We had a great time and Nina was very helpful and answered any question that we had. The house is nicely located to give you the atmosphere of the olive groves and you can hear the sea. The village catered for most of our needs. We recommend a narrow car to navigate the alleys and roads.
43821880,Rene September 2022 This is the cleanest and best equipped place I have ever been to and I highly recommend staying here. Nina is a great host  extremely nice  and very responsive to all questions and needs. She provides great recommendations and will do anything for you to have a great time. The location is quite and wonderful; the house is so super clean and it has anything you need. You will not regret staying here!
43821880,Russell June 2022 Nina was a generous and delightful host. She was attentive to all of our needs and offered helpful suggestions for things to do and see while in Corfu. The kitchen was well stocked with breakfast items and the apartment was incredibly clean. The views and garden are stunning and the location is very quiet and peaceful. Nina had so many personal touches waiting for us upon our arrival. She went above and beyond to make sure we had a lovely time. We can’t wait to come back again.
43821880,Anton June 2022 A truly amazing place with wonderfull host. Corfu is a must see and so is the place of Nina. There is nothing one will miss in her beautiful traditional house.
43821880,Kaia May 2022 We loved this place - the house was cozy  very well decorated  clean. When we arrived  we had some welcome-gift  that was very heart warming. Nina also had bought us some groceries that we could make us breakfast next morning. This all made us feel like home. There were coffe and tea available  and also some oil  spices - we didn't have to buy them extra. Nina was always reachable by WhatsUp. Our daughter left her airpods there  so Nina posted them by mail. So  overall  we loved our vacation there and we felt like home  didn't want to leave at all.
43821880,Emma April 2022 Off the beaten track in a real Greek fishing village - a little way out of the village along a quiet country lane you will find this perfect Airbnb house and amazing garden. Nina and her family are loving  generous and authentic  if you wish to get a taste of real life Corfiot life  then this is a place you want to stay. We had no car  so used the bikes provided to get around and the local bus service- walking to town for lunch at the brilliant tavernas - Angela’s and Chris ‘Sofias’  and the short trek through olive groves to the sandy  sheltered fishing cove for a swim. The local people were also so kind and welcoming  giving us oranges  chocolate and treats every visit  getting my son to help out with painting a seascape and giving him Easter decorations  even delivering our shopping for us - their generosity was touching. Nina’s house is spotlessly clean  modern  despite the historic fabric  and has absolutely everything you might need for a comfortable stay; if not Nina does everything to make sure she can get what you need. I can not recommend highly enough. A very special mention to Nina’s Dad  Alexandro who can provide the freshest fish and the very best local wine  as well as telling a good story. Thank you Nina! 😘
43821880,Dirk April 2022 Cute little cottage in a very scenic mountain area. Nice garden  very friendly host. Thanks  Nina!
43821880,Sophie April 2022 One of the best Airbnbs I have stayed in.  The flat is very lovingly decorated with attention to detail. You will find everything you need and even more. The most extensive equipment I have ever experienced in an Airbnb.  The flat has a beautiful garden with a barbecue place and seating. The view is very beautiful. The surroundings are quiet and pleasant. Lots of nature.  There are beautiful olive groves nearby and a path to a quiet bay and an old harbour with a few fishing boats. The flat is a good starting point for day trips  although a rental car is recommended. Nina also provided bikes for us.  The communication was excellent. Nina was always available and took good care of us. We will definitely come back! :-)
43821880,Johanneke October 2021 Our stay at Mantzaros Country House was amazing and with Nina as our host it was even better! We (3 friends) arrived at Mantzaros after a long journey. Nina welcomed us with a tour through the house and the amazing big garden. The house is located on a quiet road. The garden is located on the other side of the road and has a sea view. A car is necessery and the roads might be challenging. The house is nicely decorated  clean and fully equiped. Everything you can think of is present. Nina gave us a lot of tips also provided breakfast for the first morning. During our stay we could always ask Nina for tips and information about the area or recommendations for places to eat. We highly recommend this place!!!
43821880,Andres September 2021 The place is beautiful  the host is a wonderful and attentive person  the location is extremely quiet and very nice; the Airbnb is comfortable and extremely clean  super well equipped. If you are searching for a very quiet place and vacation this is for you. You need a car if you want to see the rest of Corfu.
43821880,Tomasz September 2021 Mantzaros Country House is located in a beautiful place outside of the Pentati village. The house is really cosy and it has everything one needs. Nina and her family were always there to help us if we would need anything. They would bring us homemade wine  homegrown vegetables and fresh fish! We grilled the fish in a private olive tree garden next to the house and it was the best meal during our whole stay in the Corfu island. 😋  We stayed 11 days in Mantzaros Country House and we wished we could stay longer. It's an ideal place to spend time with your friends or family and fully enjoy Corfiot life!
43821880,Alis August 2021 Nina was really the kindest and nicest host ever. The house was clean and you have everything you need (even insect repellant sprays and different creams). Even though our stay was short  we felt her warmth and kindness. Her recomandations were also great  especially the tavernas from Pentati (Angela’s Taverna). Thank you for everything Nina 🤗
43821880,Sébastien August 2021 Mantzaros house is a fantastic place and Nina is definitely the best host you can imagine. We have spend an amazing week at Mantzaros house with a lot of splendid beaches close from the house (special mention to the sunset swimming at Agiou Nikolaou   a few hundred meter south to Paramonas). The house is perfectly clean  with everything you need (and more) and Nina was always very responsive to give us all the tips and information I was asking for. Also the 2 taverns in Pentati (2 km from the house) are among the best food experience in Corfu. Sofia's Chris Place with an amazing view and excellent food and Angela's with a unique kindest family cooking traditional Greek meals (unfortunately discovered only the last night...) Mantzaros house was clearly a fantastic experience for us and I recommend it warmly to everyone staying I Corfu.
43821880,Johannes August 2021 We spent two fantastic weeks at Nina's house. She and her family are really lovely people  who made a huge effort to make our stay as great as possible. Any request was answered immediately. Additionally we got useful tips from her  as a local  for locations  restaurants and beaches. Best of all: Local fish and scampi from Alexandros  Nina's father  including a delicious recipe how to cook scampi properly. Best host we ever had!
43821880,Jakub July 2021 We came as guests and left as friends! For is it was a perfect spot  with a perfect view  with all that you need in the house  with nice and informative conversations and some other extras we have not even expected. It is a 5 star review - wholeheartedly.  For others: you need a car - there's a place to park it. And you need to be prepared for some narrow and steep roads in the area. It is such a beautiful part of the island...
43821880,Serhii June 2021 Very cozy and quiet place. Nina is a great host in every way. She really cares about making you feel welcome and making sure that you have everything you need while here. The apartment is clean and stylish. WiFi was slow. Response from Nina June 2021 A very polite happy and extra friendly group of people that stayed at my house and made me feel very comfortable! My house is open to them anytime in future!
43821880,Anna Elisabeth June 2021 The Lovely Little House with The wonderful Garden is a good Place   when you like it quiet and to be far way from Tourists. Nina and her family is specially friendly and would like to fulfill every wish. The house inside is lovely decorated. It’s a very good stay. Response from Nina June 2021 Anna her husband and the kids   an amazing family ! Special guests  very friendly and polite we had a veey good communication ! I would be happy to host them again !
43821880,"Mona November 2020 Dear Nina  You are such a friendly and courteous hostess! We thank you for everything! We had a great time  even with Corona  because you made it so uncomplicated. We just wanted to say ""THANK YOU"" for....: ... our sweet home ... the wine  the olives the fantastic fish and olive oil ... the personal workman with the super glue :)  You are invited to Germany whenever you want! Thank you that we meet each other   we wish you and your family all the best! Stay safe! Katharina and Mona"
43821880,Britta September 2020 The place is absolutly perfect for a wonderful holiday. The house is one of the best equipped locations we ever had. Really nothing is missing: coffee  milk  honey  oil  wine from her father and so on. Besides the house and the garden are really well decorated. Nina is a very special host. She gave us a lot of tipps for the area: beautiful beaches  hiking trails or other places of interest. Thanks for these! Our holiday in your home was more then perfect. We can highly recommend this amazing place.
43821880,Claudia September 2020 We spent two weeks in Corfu and we absolutely loved this place! Nina and her family were outstanding hosts and made us feel at home  spoiling us with homemade wine  fresh fish and vegetables and filling up the fridge with basics for us. My husband and I were traveling with our baby girl and we were provided with a crib  a high chair and a lot of lovely amenities. There were even beach toys and a swimming ring waiting for her (which she totally enjoyed)!  The house is located close to the village of Pentati (where there's two tavernas with delicious Greek food and a supermarket) and 15 min. walking from the Vagionaki harbour. Paramonas beach is also a 5 min. drive away and it's perfect for children  with very little waves and shallow waters. You will need a car to move around and the roads are very narrow but that didn't bother us. People are extremely friendly and we felt like a part of the village by the end of our stay.  The kitchen was well equipped for cooking  everything was really clean and there's a grill in the garden  which we put to good use. I would highly recommend this place for families! :-) Show more
43821880,Anette August 2020 Very very nice house! Nina is an extraordinary host! They staying was more then perfect. I can strongly recommend this place.
43821880,Juraj August 2020 Nina's place is a great choice for explorers and people who want to experience authentic Corfu. It is situated near dramatic cliffs with picturesque views. The sea/mountain scenery is just amazing. The nearby village of Pentati is as authentic as it gets with one minimarket and two tavernas that offer traditional Corfiot cuisine. However  I recommend renting a car or quad  because both the village and Nina's house are quite remote in the hills.  In the house (which is by the way beutifully decorated and carefully renovated) you can find everything you need for a comfortable holiday (all necessary kitchen equipment  washing machine  microwave  toaster  towels  shower gel  shampoo  umbrellas for the beach  barbeque equipment  etc.). There is also a ceiling fan in each room. The whole place was crystal clean!  We arrived at midnight and Nina was waiting for us with a bottle of local wine and left some snacks and water in the fridge which was very kind of her. Nina is a caring host. She gave us great tips for beaches or hiking and brought a bottle of sweet white wine several times. Her father runs a fish shop  so we bought almost one kilo of prawns  a big fish  and a large squid for a very good price (around 40€). The barbeque in the garden during a hot summer night was just amazing!!!  To sum up  I highly recommend Nina's place. You will experience an unforgettable holiday in Corfu. Show more
43821880,Julien August 2020 Nina was a wonderfull host. We arrive late and she wait for us. During all the preparation of our trip she help us and she was always here for any question. She gives some good tips. The house is very confortable and well decorated. She offers us some wine for welcoming  and there was everything in the flat for cooking even rice or honey. The outsize is very beautiful with a giant garden included barbecue. We feel like home. I recommand obviously this house. Julien
43821880,Helene November 2022 Nina is a golden host! She is very welcoming  accommodating with the schedules of our plane  available at all times in complete discretion  and very good tips for starting our stay. The house is a small paradise  close to several breathtaking beaches. The place is strategic for visiting several parts of the island. The accommodation is impeccably clean  over-equipped  very pleasant. A big thank you to Nina!! Translated from French  Show original

43821880,Maaike July 2022 We enjoyed our stay at Nina's place very much. Everything is available for a family of 4. All possible cooking utensils  washing machine  hairdryer and even snorkels. The garden is fantastic and it was very nice that we were allowed to use the tomatoes from the garden for our own prepared Greek salads. The house is in a quiet location. There is a street between the house and the garden  but there is not much traffic. The nearest beach is about a 20-minute walk  but we usually took the car to a beach further - a few minutes' drive away (no problem to park). In the village there are three tasty affordable restaurants and a mini shop. The communication went very smoothly and Nina gave us tips and helped us to arrange a doctor's visit. Nina's papa- who came to water the plants was also very friendly. In short: highly recommended for those who like to stay in a quiet place of Corfu! Translated from Dutch  Show original
43821880,Kathrin July 2022 We were allowed to spend 2 wonderful weeks in this special place. Nina and her family are such lovely hosts that we will remember them for a long time. The colorful house with its lovingly designed garden is very well equipped and really offers everything you need. It stays pleasantly cool even on hot days/ nights. It is equipped with fly screens all around  so you never have to go mosquito hunting. The cooling stone terrace with the colorful flowers invites you to linger. Less than 5 minutes from the house is a fantastic small bay. It is not visible from the street  so you always have it to yourself. The peaceful town of Pentati also beckons with its lovely villagers  a well-equipped mini market and the STROFI  a great tavern with excellent traditional cuisine. Here you meet  large  small   here  village life plays out and as a guest you are always welcomed as if you were part of it. If you are looking for a beautiful  quiet and original place and would like to be enchanted by the Greek hospitality and warmth  you should definitely vacation here.

43821880,Natacha July 2022 Very attentive  accommodating host who gives plenty of information. It's lovely. The house is clean and well decorated. The street between the house and the garden is very quiet. The area is quiet. Only small downside  we had beautiful weather in early July and the house gets sun and heats up quickly. The cottage  smaller  behind it has this advantage. Translated from French  Show original
43821880,Tobias June 2022 Greece is known for its hospitality  and we have been able to confirm this several times in recent years. But Nina and her family exceed this experience. They always go out of their way to make you feel like you're vacationing with friends. The apartment is very clean and lovingly furnished  everything seems very new. The place is very suitable to quickly reach the important sights of the island from a quiet home. Thanks to its western location  there is always a refreshing breeze  at least in early summer. We made some beautiful hikes in the adjacent mountain/ hills in the 12 days and visited many idyllic swimming beaches and - booked. Translated from German  Show original

The house is located on the small  very little busy road between Pentati and Halikounas. The proximity to the street is not a problem at all. Every day the baker passes by and sells fresh cheap delicious bread. Luckily  you'll also catch the fisherman. We walked from the house to Pentati in the tavern and on the 'Hausberg'. Nina is a very likeable warm and helpful hostess. Translated from German  Show original

43821880,Marie July 2021 Very good stay at Nina's. Super welcome at 1 a.m.! The small beach nearby is a real pool...Nina tells us plenty of places to discover  she is always smiling. We just found the beds a little too hard...but that's okay  we took naps in the hammock;) thank you so much for the stay. Translated from French  Show original Response from Nina July 2021 Wonderful family. I am lucky to have hosted them. They are all very kind. They left the house very clean..
43821880,Petra September 2020 It was great. I would highly recommend it 🙂 Translated from Czech  Show original
50700967,Dylan September 2022 WOW! Undoubtedly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Debbie was the most gracious host  she brought us homemade wine and gave us great recommendations on how to see Corfu like a local. The property itself was so unique with great outdoor spaces and beautiful olive trees. The cabin had electricity and a full bathroom with a shower. There was a big open balcony that overlooks the coast. This is glamping at its finest  but be aware you are in nature. We loved that aspect  but mosquitoes will share the space with you - that being said Debbie does a great job giving you all the necessary tools to fight them and they weren’t much of a bother. This place is a MUST STAY. In itself enough reason to visit Corfu. We can’t wait to go back!
50700967,Niels September 2022 Fantastic experience highly recommended if you are up to an outdoor setting
50700967,Ewa August 2022 Debie is just an Amazing host. She had fab idea making this place and she put all her heart in it. You couldn't ask for a better host! Location is great. Choosing her place is unforgettable experience. There is only one small thing: mosquitoes but Debie will do everything she can to stop them bothering you 😉
50700967,Janine July 2022 We had the absolute best time in our little cabin. The view is amazing and so are the hosts. We can really recommend staying with lovely Debbie!
50700967,Michael July 2022 Debbie was great! She gave us a lot of recommendations and had a lot of nice little suprises during our stay. Thank you so much for the wonderful time
50700967,Emily July 2022 We can highly recommend staying at the Olive groove! If you enjoy being in nature that’s the place to be. There are some beaches in the area which are in walking distance but a car/scooter would be helpful. The host Debbie is a wonderful person..she delivers super delicious cake and wine every now and then. She puts so much effort into details..there even is a guitar. And mosquitos will be your best friend at night :)
50700967,Maria July 2022 easily the best airbnb i’ve ever stayed in. the place is amazing and the host   Debbie is ever more amazing ! She provided everything we needed and more . The airbnb has some truly breathtaking views . 10000/10 recommend . Thank you so much Debbie! Will definitely visit again!
50700967,Natalie June 2022 The cabin was such a beautiful place to stay  made even better by Debbie and Nicholas’ kindness! The campsite is luscious and green and has a well equipped shared kitchen  and many seating areas  even a treehouse. The cabin was a comfortable size  it was great to have our own shower and bathroom  our own little balcony area  and the large mosquito net around the bed was pretty perfect but do bring some mosquito spray and be prepared live amongst the nature! The beach is around a 25 min downhill walk and the village around 10-15 mins walking. We had a great time and were glad to stay somewhere so beautiful!
50700967,Nicole October 2022 We stayed 2 nights in the wooden hut at the end of September and it was a great nature experience. You can even hear the sound of the sea and the air is wonderfully fresh. The shared kitchen and also the bathroom are well equipped. Here you will find everything for cooking  but also for leisure  such as snorkeling or a guitar. The perfect experience for nature lovers with the perfect hosts. 5 stars 🌟 Translated from German  Show original
50700967,Sandra September 2022 Nice place to stay  but not suitable for weather! Translated from German  Show original
50700967,Lele July 2022 place for those who love it  you are in the middle of nature  and what nature...with all the pros and cons of the case  of course. nature knows how to be aggressive ( Debbie knows what I mean..😀) the place itself is very interesting  but the rare gem is the host  a person who gives serenity in every word  a privilege to have met her. good location if you want to travel the whole island a bit  in short  highly recommended Translated from Italian  Show original
14479254,Paulina September 2021 Great place  amazing view  wide beach. Rose prepared for us a little welcome smack  gave us usefull tips for bus  market  car rent. The city is intimate  there are no good restaurants or supermarkets  but great place to rest.
14479254,Yana August 2021 Perfect location right next to the beach and incredible balcony view. We had an amazing time in this apartment! So  we can recommend this place. Rosa was very thoughtful and helpful during our stay. Thank you!
14479254,Zoi June 2021 ARIA maisonette in Glyfada Beach is a gorgeous place to stay! We loved every moment in ARIA.  Just renovated  with tasteful furniture and bright spacious rooms! Incredible views of the sea which is within walking distance (200m away). ARIA was sparkling clean and we felt safe and at ease from a hygienic point of view. ARIA has all mod cons and equipment for cooking at home if you wish.  Rosa  the hostess  is an incredibly kind person  made us feel very welcome and she responded very fast to our questions. Whilst Rosa is local  she has travelled the world and therefore  she was able to provide us with fantastic suggestions that suited our every need.  We are definitely coming back very soon! Thank you Rosa <3
14479254,Thomas September 2020 Rosa is a loveley host. The appartment is perfect for a family. The balkonies have an amazing view and you can get to the beach in under 5 minutes. I can recommend this appartment!
14479254,Marián September 2020 Amazing owner  beautiful place with astonishing view close to the beach. Everything was taken care of by the owner and we didnt need to care about anything and just relax.
14479254,Cara August 2020 We had a relaxing time staying in Rosa's apartment which is part of a complex of apartments next to the big  sandy and beautiful Glyfada beach. It was lovely waking up to sit on the balcony and watch the sea! Rosa was very kind and helpful during our stay. The only downsides are that the wifi in the apartment complex is too weak  and the door to the second bedroom does not close. There is a restaurant on the beach and we visited there to use their wifi and do a bit of work.
14479254,Davide July 2022 very nice apartment  on two levels (day and night) a stone's throw from the sea. Parking included. Translated from Italian  Show original
52506822,Elizabeth October 2022 What a privilege to say in this lovely well equipped villa. Everything was spotlessly clean. The location right on the beach was perfect. The sun rise in the morning was spectacular. We enjoyed a wonderful relaxing week. Thank you.
52506822,Amanda October 2022 Very nice house with lovely views. The scenery is amazing! A bit out of the way but nothing a taxi or car rental couldn't fix. There was one or two issues like the storm blew out the internet and some electricity issues but this wasnt the fault of the owner. All in all we loved our stay and will hopefully return in the future
52506822,Jennifer October 2022 We had a pleasant week at Villa Pomme. The beach area is nice and so ist the house. Spacious rooms  bathrooms and kitchen was good for our group of people. The house keeper was nice  unforseen were groceries which were bought by him before our check in. A car is necessary due to the location far off the cities  which is what we were looking for a relaxing week.
52506822,Donika September 2022 Extremely tranquil and calm
52506822,Tom August 2022 Amazing house   perfect for a few families with kids . Beach at end of garden with very warm sea water . House is big . For a relaxing week away it’s very good value
52506822,George July 2022 Beautiful place with your own private sandy beach and shallow clean water  very clean big house  very responsive host  me and my family loved it and we will definitely go there again. I am recommending this place with no hesitation.
52506822,Ole July 2022 Very nice Villa overall  should remove some of the bunkbeds for doubles (+ missing a pool). Response from Pomme July 2022 There is a huge natural swimming pool a few steps from the house with naturally warm water at 70cm deep. What more could you ask for  a huge playground.! The swimming pool is for me completely useless.
52506822,Imante April 2022 The villa is in we're quiet place  on the beach abou 50 steps from the sea. In the villa you will find everything you need for a big family. The town it is not far away you can walk (we had a car  but we walk everyday. Not far from villa you vill find the fishermans were you could buy fresh fish. High recommendation for stay with company or a big family. We loved.
52506822,Nicolas November 2022 Great welcome  good location. Very nice house. Translated from French  Show original
52506822,Nathalie August 2022 Idyllic place  with private beach and especially people  we had the sea to ourselves!!!!! The relaxing area and the waterfront cabin are very pleasant. Lefkimmi is ideal to be in peace while having restaurants and supermarkets next door. We are delighted with our stay at this well equipped villa  very good bedding and air conditioning throughout. Hosted by extremely kind and helpful Greek guards. I really recommend this house. Nathalie Translated from French  Show original
52506822,Florian June 2022 We had a wonderful stay in Pomm's house. It is equipped with everything you need for a nice holiday with your friends. Especially beautiful is the large kitchen where you can cook together. Afterwards  you can enjoy the evening on the terrace with a beautiful view. The check-in/check-out also went smoothly and the communication was excellent. The neighbors who take care of the house were also super nice and took great care of us. The highlight is the beach a few steps away from the house. A great way to relax! Beautiful water and some snorkeling opportunities are also available!! All around a fantastic vacation!! Thank you for that!! Translated from German  Show original
53121232,William September 2022 An amazing villa with the most fantastic views. I couldn’t recommend Villa Helena any more.
53121232,Isabel July 2022 We had a lovely stay with our family! the house is super spacious and comfortable  great pool and outstanding support from our host! The house is located in the middle of the island so you can go anywhere from there. There are supermarkets nearby (by car) where you can get everything you need. We will for sure go back!!
53121232,Nicholas June 2022 Wow - a truly remarkable vacation. Johnny went above and beyond to make sure we were cared for like we were his own family! Not to mention  the villa is astonishing. The views are second to none  and the appliances are all brand new and clean. Having a washer and dryer was a huge plus! A luxury vacation is what you will receive when you stay at Villa Helanes!
53121232,Justine August 2022 Johnny is very welcoming and very attentive to his tenants. Translated from French  Show original
54404392,Peter September 2022 We felt very well at Spiros and Amalie's place  like at our friends' place. If you are looking for a quiet place away from the hustle and bustle with a nice view and not far from the beach  this is a great choice. A big plus for us was the garden and the children's corner. The food was really excellent. Amelia and Spiros are very nice people and great hosts. Thank you for a great time! Peter   Sincerely  Peter
54404392,Barbora September 2022 Spiros and his mother Amalie are excellent hosts and friendly people. Everything was perfect. Apartment was fully equipped  clean  perfect service  every meal we got was so tasty. When we arrived we got homemade wine and pie and the dinner was also prepaired for us. Next morning we got big breakfast and the sea view…Amazing! We can highly recommend this accommodation. Hope we come back next year. 👋
54404392,Tamsin September 2022 Beautiful stay at Spiros’! Just a minutes walk to the beach  beautiful garden  Spiros is a great cook and lots of restaurants and bars along the beach  perfect relaxing getaway. Will be back!!
54404392,Olivia August 2022 Position of the house is perfect  Spiros  Alexandros and their Mum are very kind and helpful person  it was like beeing at home. Everything was perfect and also Spiros Dinners were wonderful  I suggest you everything there. Vacation was wonderful there! THANK YOU We are really happy
54404392,Maja August 2022 We traveled as a family with children (6 and 12 years). We all had a wonderful and relaxing time. The property is set in a flowering garden with great views of the ocean. The apartment was great for us. The children each had their own area with us in the room with a bed  which was accessible via a steep staircase. Everything was well secured by railings and very solidly built. Most importantly: Spiros and Amalia were incredibly warm. We have always been spoiled with fruit and cakes. To order  Spiros cooks excellent meals for guests. He was very much in line with our wishes. Our children also liked Spiros dishes very much. They also enjoyed being able to play in the garden when we were eating even longer. We thank Spiros  Amalia and Aleksandros and recommend a stay there to everyone!

26450591,David October 2022 We have just returned from a fabulous week at this beautiful villa.  Everything was perfect. We were welcomed by George from host lab who showed us round and ensured that everything was in place. The villa was everything we could ask for and more.  Beautiful location  thoughtful aspects - such as leaving some local produce  amazing pool along with other lovely touches. Rita was so helpful with anything we need (even finding a precious ring after we had left!). I would recommend this for anyone who wants a perfect holiday in Corfu. We would love to return again sometime in the future. Thank you
26450591,Heather October 2022 Our family of four had one of the best holidays ever at this gorgeous house in Corfu. Everything was perfect. we hope to return soon.
26450591,Tom October 2022 Amazing stay at Astrit & Rita’s place! Fantastic views from a beautiful home. Astrit was there on arrival to show us around the house  & Rita popped in throughout the week to check in & stock us up with whatever we needed. Car & confident driver is a must as this villa is high in the hills with a steep/tight driveway. Kassiopi only 10 minute drive  & just under 1hr to airport.
26450591,Chris October 2022 What a beautifully stunning Villa. We stayed as a couple for a quiet week away from it all.  The host and wider team were fantastic and highly responsive to resolve any questions we had  and even quickly attended the location to provide a first aid kit!  The Villa is perfect to enjoy the sun by the pool  or the indoor fire to relax.  We’ll definitely look forward to returning  and we’ve already recommended it to our friends.
26450591,Sophie September 2022 This is a wonderful  stylish villa with the most beautiful views of the coast and Albania. It is perfectly situated up the hill in the peaceful calm but is only 10 minutes away from Kassiopi and other beaches. There is a plunge pool (no steps in) enjoying the views and a side shallow area for young children. The sun loungers are very comfortable and the outdoor table perfected shaded. Rita looked after us brilliantly with the fridge stocked with essentials when we arrived  helped with any queries and kept the villa spotless. Highly recommend you book and enjoy this very special place. We shall return!
26450591,Rachel September 2022 We have just returned from a wonderful week of rest  fun and relaxation at Astrit and Rita’s beautiful home. The booking was smooth and communication with Hostlab fast and clear. Astrit met us upon arrival and showed us around the villa which really was a home from home. A very kind and thoughtful welcome pack was gladly received which helped us to settle in very quickly. The villa itself is a masterful creation of Astrit’s hard work. Rita has styled and designed it beautifully to compliment the stone and hand built wooden features throughout. Stepping out to the outdoor pool area is quite simply breathtaking. The view out to Albania and beyond is stunning and good for one’s soul. A beautiful hand built outdoor kitchen area compliments this area where you can enjoy meals around the solid wood table and enjoy using the outdoor barbecue with the use of all tools provided. An added bonus for us was using another outdoor asset  the wood fired pizza oven. Rita so kindly prepared dough and the most delicious fresh tomato pizza sauce. The pizza’s were immensely enjoyed and would rival any Italian Pizzeria - if we can say so ourselves! Rita was on hand throughout our stay making us feel so welcome. We would not hesitate to recommend a stay in this villa and will most definitely look forward to one day returning. It felt like staying in our own private 5 star hotel with complete peace and privacy. We have returned with a weeks worth of wonderful memories that will last a lifetime. Show more
26450591,Tania August 2022 The most fabulous villa in the most amazing setting . The views to the sea were stunning . Our hosts were exceptionally kind and had thought of everything . They were on hand to give us great recommendations as well which was very helpful. The villa is incredibly well situated and is a 10 Minute drive to most good restaurants and beaches !
26450591,Steph July 2022 Wonderful villa with amazing views and so beautifully furnished. The pool is incredible. We spent hours just taking in the peace and beauty of the location around the pool. Rita and Astrit were so helpful  leaving fresh food and wine and helping with boat hire etc We cannot recommend it enough Steph  Dave and family
26450591,Steve June 2022 The Villa is fantastic  great views  very private and very well equipped for a lovely family holiday. The BBQ and PIZZA oven facilities were a big hit the kids and Miss Rita is a great host. We will certainly be returning.
26450591,Jaanus May 2022 Perfect Villa to stay in when visiting Corfu. It has everything you may need - great views to sea and mountains  beautifully decorated house and a pool. The hosts were really helpful and gave us tips on the places to visit. Would recommend the stay for everyone.
26450591,Tara May 2022 The Sinium villa is beautiful. The view from the villa and the pool is something me and my family will never forget. Rita and George were extremely helpful throughout our trip and always responded quickly to any queries we had. The decoration and finish of the villa was immaculate and I would not hesitate to stay at the villa again in the future.
26450591,Michel & Jacqueline May 2022 We’ve had a wonderful time in this wonderful house. We visted with our teenage children. There was enough room and privacy for all of us  so important! The view is spectacular and the house feels warm and cozy  it has a good vibe. Be sure to rent a car though  the hills are steep! The host is caring and the communication was easy and pleasant. Lovely place!
26450591,Harvey April 2022 My daughter said that this is the best Airnb place she has ever stayed at - and the whole family immediately agreed. This is a spectacular villa perched in the hills of Kassipoi with amazing views of the ocean. Close to all amenities and lots of sight seeing places close by. Superb  friendly and attentive team who helped with any and all of our needs. Great value for money.
26450591,J April 2022 This is a fabulous air b n b - the accommodation is to an incredibly high standard - it’s a beautiful villa with amazing views. Rita is hugely helpful and gave us lots of top tips for beaches and tavernas. We loved the pool  table football and ping pong. We will definitely be going back.
26450591,Steven October 2021 This property is simply wonderful. We have stayed in many villas  and the view from this one is by far the best we've had. And the property itself is so lovely – it's got everything you need and for a rental is very highly finished. Rita  who was our host  was amazing – very helpful and welcoming – without being intrusive. We would definitely go again.
26450591,John October 2021 Amazing from beginning to end. Rita and Astrid were amazing throughout the week and nothing was too much trouble.  The villa was as breathtaking in real life as the photos. Facilities and living accommodation within the villa were superb and suited us very well.  Good location and only ten minutes to Kassiopi  lovely little beaches  shops etc.  Fantastic week and can’t wait to go back!
26450591,Paula October 2021 A great secluded villa perfect for a family or friends. Of course you need a car but most things are only 10 mins away. Beautiful views and the villa has everything you need. Rita was there when you needed her and provided great tips and recommendation. Perfect for a family. The third bedroom is a on the small side great for kids maybe not so great for 2 adults as the bed is a small double with the bathroom downstairs. But this is a minor thing we had a great stay
26450591,Neil October 2021 Magical house in a magical location in the hills overlooking the sea. My family and I spent a wonderful week here. Rita was very kind and even booked a boat trip for us. The craftsmanship everywhere around the house is incredible. I would highly recommend this place for families or a ground of friends looking to spend quality time together. You will definitely need a car to reach the house as the road up is a little sketchy at times but no more so than any other road in the hills of Corfu.
26450591,Sigrun September 2021 The Sinium luxury villa is absolutely wonderful! Very tastefully decorated throughout and supplied with high quality homeware. And the host Rita thought of absolutely everything  from supplying some necessary food essentials on our arrival as well as accommodating every request during our stay  including some home made pizza dough!  We had our small baby with us and they supplied a travel cot  high chair and baby bath for our use. The villa is great for families but also for a small group of friends. They have a large bbq area  a wood fired pizza oven  table football and an amazing infinity pool with views over Albania across the sea. The nearest town is just a 10-15 minute drive away with lots of lovely places to eat and a couple of pretty beaches. If you’re looking for a private place to enjoy some time in the sun  this villa is definitely for you :) I will definitely be staying here again!
26450591,Emma September 2021 Fantastic place. Can’t rate it highly enough
26450591,Kelly June 2021 This place is INCREDIBLE. Absolutely gorgeous interior design  amazing infinity pool with views to die for  comfortable bed and nice quality linens. Everything is amazing. There is so much love put into this place by Rita and her family - you can see it everywhere in the attention to detail  the hand carved wood features  the fresh herbs and garden  everything is so beautiful and well thought out. It was truly amazing. We came with a baby and Rita thought of everything - a high chair  cot  baby bath and she even bought our little one a lovely gift. The pool has a large shallow area perfect for little ones. This is a beautiful stay and very close to Kalami and kassiopi with loads of restaurants. Book it!
26450591,Anna June 2021 Absolutely stunning villa  even more beautiful in reality than in photos. Very spacious  with all appliances possible to have a comfortable stay for 6. Beautiful pool which can be heated up to about 32C; and garden with sun loungers  mint & rosemary bushes  a small vegetable garden  a grill area and a large table to enjoy the views from. And a spacious terrace with sofas on the top floor. The villa is slightly off the beaten track and a car is necessary to drive to the towns (Kassiopi  Kalami) and beaches nearby. I highly recommend renting a 4x4 for less experienced drivers as the drive to the villa is up  up  up :)
26450591,Ian October 2020 We had a week that just kept giving  the hospitality from the hosts Rita & family was special so thoughtful so kind. The villa WOW!! Location Pool Facilities the best we can’t wait to return.
26450591,Konrad October 2020 This place is spectacular! From the first moment we had a feeling that we are at home and enjoyed our time all the time. Host is very nice and supportive for any request and explanations about the home and island. I highly recommend and definitely will be back in the future.
26450591,Karsten October 2020 Incredible view from the patio as well as from the infinity pool. Nice hosts and many small villages as well as nice beaches just minutes away by car. There’s literally everything available in the house and even fruits  honey and local products on arrival along with a warm welcome! The kids loved the warm pool - we can recommend it for kids! Hope to be back soon!
26450591,Tom & Eve September 2020 The villa is sure spectacular! Absolute privacy and peace. We used the pool every day and enjoyed the fantastic views. We can recommend this villa to everybody who loves luxury and privacy.
26450591,David September 2020 Just the most amazing villa - first class construction  every detail has been considered. Rita and her husband are amazing hosts and you will LOVE the infinity pool and long range views of sea and mountains!
26450591,Emma August 2020 Sinium is an incredible villa with the most beautiful views. Made even better with stunning  well designed terraces and pool with great planting all around. We were welcomed with a wonderful food parcel including fresh fruit and veg from the garden. And Rita made us the best pizza dough so that we could cook our own pizzas in the pizza oven. It’s an outstanding villa and definitely worth the trip up into the hills where it’s a bit cooler and unbeatable views.
26450591,Chris August 2020 Without doubt the best villa we have stayed at. The pictures on the listing do not do it justice and the views are quite spectacular. The design of the villa is incredibly well thought out and they make excellent use of local and natural materials. There are countless great beaches nearby but we needed up spending afternoons by the pool which benefited from a bit more of a breeze. It is hard to think of any negatives  however you should be aware that the smaller bedroom does not have air con. The hosts Astrid and Rita are fantastic and cannot do enough to help.
26450591,Nathalie July 2020 We had an amazing time at Rita’s house. It’s wonderfully private yet close to the beach and the town of Kassiopi. Rita was a wonderful host. Would highly recommend.
26450591,Patrick July 2020 Very nice house  very clean.
26450591,Hannah October 2019 We had such a lovely stay  the villa was just perfect for what we wanted. Rita was so lovely and helpful and hd stocked the house with some lovely food for our arrival. Everything has been thought through with so many personal touches. The pool was great  we loved that it was fresh water and not full of chemicals. Rita arranged a day to come and clean so she wouldn't disturb us but was always at the end of the phone should we have needed her. The location is beautiful  the view is just stunning and although you need a car to get around it is only 10 minutes from Kalami and Kassiopi  both of which have everything you need. We can't wait to return!
26450591,Catherine October 2019 Absolutely gorgeous villa  with everything you need plus more to make your stay comfortable. The hosts were so generous and left lovely little touches like food and toiletries etc  cleaned the property whilst we were there but also left us to have our own independence so it felt very much like 'our' home whilst we were there. Traveled with a 2yr old and was great for a toddler with shallow parts of the pool he could go in etc. Couldn't recommend enough!!
26450591,Andy October 2019 We had an incredible week long stay. The pool and view have to be seen to be believed. Rooms are fully kitted out and the beds super comfy. If you’re considering Corfu then this is the place!
26450591,Tecwyn September 2019 Rita is a wonderful host  helping us from the moment we arrived to the minute we left. Property is stunning and the best Airbnb we have experienced. Highly recommend this property for a luxurious break. Car is required! Wonderful place  would stay there again
26450591,Andrew August 2019 The setting is outstanding and the villa fabulous. It is a great  private oasis with amazing views  lots of space (though  admittedly  we were only two) and good amenities. Rita and Astrit were very helpful and accommodating and couldn't have been lovelier. Really a special place to relax and get away from the normal day to day.
26450591,Renate July 2019 Rita is such a lovely person  nothing is to much for her! The house is a bit far away from restaurants or supermarkets but nothing beats the wonderful view and accommodation! Be prepared for the mosquitos at the morning or evening in the veranda  there is a big pizza oven to organize your own pizza party  the pool is wonderful and cleaned almost every day  the kitchen has everything to comfort a home cook (except for the baking pans they are not really good  I think they are not supposed to be washed in the dishwasher)  Thank you Rita  we've had a great stay! All the best!
26450591,Clement June 2019 Astonishing view. Swimming pool with 'baby area'. Good equipment. Our local contact was very reactive and supportive (suggestions of local Car Rental  suggestions for Cooking Chef). Highly recommended!
26450591,Dennis May 2019 The villa is incredible right down to the smallest details. The view alone is worth the price. Add to that the incredible pool  outdoor dining and cooking area  secluded and quite surroundings and you got yourself the perfect spot for your vacation. We are already looking through our calendar to see  when we can go back.
26450591,Diego April 2019 This is a beautiful and stylish villa with a truly exceptional view over a Mediterranean forest  the blue sea and Albania. The hosts are extremely friendly and kind  they made us feel at home  pampered us  made little surprises and gave us good tips when we asked. The house is fully equipped  with absolutely anything you might need. It is very quiet and not too far (about 15 min driving) from a little coastal town with restaurants  and from beautiful beaches. The swimming pool is clean and with running water which makes you feel as if you were lounging close to a river in a magical forest. We have spent a wonderful time.
26450591,Steve April 2019 Amazing house and view with very friendly hosts
26450591,Charlotte October 2018 A beautiful villa with stunning views and everything thought of for a really relaxing stay
26450591,Dario October 2018 My stay in Siniés village with Astrit and Rita was the highlight of my stay in Corfu. Nestled on top of a hill overlooking Corfu  the Ionian sea and with views of Sarande and Butrint in Albania  this beautiful home is the stuff of dreams - with magnificent sunrises and spectacular sunsets. The house is so peaceful  with sounds of cicadas and birds for company and so many nooks to relax  read and take in the views. The home itself is just stunning - built by Astrit and decorated by Rita  it's full of personal touches - from the charming veranda  to the beautiful  well appointed kitchen  craftsman details throughout  gorgeous refreshing pool  all surrounded by olive trees  flowering shrubs  Mediterranean herbs and nature. If you fancy going into town  Kassiopi is just mere kilometers away  as is Kalami bay  where one can visit one of the former Durrell residences. I was warmly welcomed by Rita and her mother and got to meet Rita's family on my stay - their warm  genuine hospitality truly shines through ! My stay at Sinium Villa was absolutely spectacular in every respect  thank you Rita and Astrit for a truly memorable stay!
26450591,Niko October 2018 Fantastic views from almost every room of the house and from every point of the property gave us a perfect relaxation and recovery during our one week stay. Everything is new  high standard and tasteful decorated. Kassiopi is in reach (about 6 km) but you need some time to get used to drive these winding and steep roads with the rental car. We enjoyed the well responsive service and communication with our hosts  who live close by.
26450591,Claudio September 2018 The stay we really enjoyed it and everything was perfect. I can recommend the house with the best of my conscience. the garden is beautiful  the pool is amazing.
26450591,Lucie August 2018 Rita & Astrid were the perfect hosts  nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was incredible  even down to proving toothbrushes  toothpaste  deodorant  sewing kit  first aid  shampoo  soap  conditioner and even hairspray and that was just in the bathroom. Rita had filled our fridge with local goodies to welcome us  including a bottle of wine a beers  so kind. The villa was stunning  they had thought of everything  and the pool view was the stuff of dreams! Rita cleaned the house twice during our 1 week stay but we never saw her  it was like Mary Poppins had been when we came home!  I would highly recommend this villa to anyone who wants beauty  class  5 star luxury and friendly hosts  truly a holiday to remember. Thank you Rita and Astrid.
26450591,Greg August 2018 The villa is perfect for a family holiday and very well appointed. The hosts did everything they could to ensure we had a wonderful time. We would recommend this property to anyone looking for a fantastic stay in Corfu and couldn’t have asked for more.
26450591,Joe August 2018 Amazing villa  fantastic views  add great hosts who are always available and you have the perfect villa. The pictures do not do it justice  the grounds are quite extensive with different areas offering seclusion when required  great for hide and seek! Centrally located for the best parts of Corfu and not too far for day trips to the south.
26450591,Michael July 2018 Mrs Rita and Mr. Astrid were the perfect hosts and welcomed us extremely friendly. The house exceeded our expectations to the maximum. Small details like an enjoyable smell by candles in the house till some groceries and fresh fruits in the fridge made our first hours in the house already perfect. The kitchen is fully equipped and we were able to cook and bbq’ for a decent group of friends. Another thing that impressed us a lot were all the handcrafted wooden furniture that Mr. Astrid has done himself. From the bed  shelf’s  even until the bin in the bathrooms. We have never seen so much love to detail. Not to mention the pool that had the perfect refreshing temperature and no smell of chlorine what so ever. Just wonderful!!  We felt like home and are planing to renting the house again for several weeks next summer. We’re looking forward to returning.
26450591,Goce July 2018 Lovely place for rest  beatiful stonehouse with amasing view  friendly and very welcoming hosts. Everything is brand new and modern and the house is perfect for families. Our stay there was amazing.
26450591,Julie April 2022 Thanks to Rita and Georges for a wonderful stay The house is beautiful   the views amazing  probably the nicest vacation rental for us! Everything was perfect   we'll be back with great pleasure Thanks again! Julie and Benoit Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Ambroise July 2021 Big disappointment ! The house presented on the site that we rented for its view  was occupied by other people. We were accommodated in a new villa located nearby (certainly comfortable inside)  but without the exceptional view or the possibility of having meals outside facing the sea. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Elisabeth September 2020 We really appreciated the tranquility and amenities at this place. Everything worked out well and we were received very kindly and with food purchased for breakfast from Rita. Her tips were valuable. We highly recommend the place.

26450591,Bernard November 2019 Great stay in a unique and very comfortable place. Perfect welcome Translated from French  Show original
26450591,"Marie September 2019 Villa Sinium met and exceeded all our expectations! :-) We arrived late at night  the house was beautifully illuminated inside and out  partly with candles. Everything was as in the photos and even more beautiful  VERY well maintained with a lot of love for detail - everything was really thought of. So many wood handicrafts can be found inside and out  really great. You just have to experience the view live  there is no photo enough!!! You can't get tired of it... Finally  we need to mention our hosts  Rita and her husband  they are wonderful. Rita is so warm  was always available and very helpful  THANK YOU!!! 😊Upon arrival  a ""basic equipment"" such as bread  butter  jam  yogurt  milk  juice  wine and a huge fruit basket were already waiting for us  very attentive. We fell in love with this great house immediately and can absolutely recommend it! 💕 Translated from German  Show original"
26450591,Florent August 2019 The house is perfect  very well furnished  with a great view and very nice outdoor spaces. It's a great place to rest  the hosts are very available and everything is planned for you to have an unforgettable stay. Only small downside  the third bedroom is small  more suitable for children. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Severine August 2019 We particularly enjoyed our stay in this very well equipped  large and very comfortable house! We were greeted with a lot of nice little touches. The view is breathtaking   the pool is on a human scale and is very pleasant. Away from the crowds  we were quiet   with only the sound of cicadas! The villa is easily accessible with a paved road to the entrance of the property. Supermarket and a top pastry shop 5 min away  lively town of Kassiopi in the evening 10 min away   for Ipsos clubbers is 25 min away. The villa is very well located  sinceit allows you to visit a beach where a different city every day. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Fabrizio June 2019 not easy to reach  the website should be given the best sign of the house Translated from Italian  Show original
26450591,Julia May 2019 The place is a dream come true. Everything is totally lovingly and tastefully decorated. The outdoor facilities are also absolutely insane. However  it is not suitable for toddlers  as the villa is located directly on the slope and you cannot let toddlers play carefree. We can 100% recommend the place - rarely felt so comfortable in a home. Translated from German  Show original
26450591,Svenja September 2018 Everything was perfect  the house was fantastically beautiful  very clean and very lovingly furnished with lots of small details. The hosts were so friendly and welcoming! We had a great stay and will definitely be back. Translated from German  Show original
26450591,Marc September 2018 Beautiful villa with all the modern comforts (and more)   but with the charm of an old house ... Everything is arranged in every detail ( toothbrushes   toothpaste   anti-mosquito lotion  etc ...) Impressive ... We loved the position of the villa .... No overlook   a green screen in front (olive trees and cypress as far as the eye can see) and this fabulous view of the Albanian coast.... The feeling of being alone in the world ... definitely the real luxury of this villa   even if again there is nothing lacking in amenities ... At the same time   the house is not far from the main sites of interest on the island  nor from the very good restaurants of Kassiopi ...   Recommended very highly .... Translated from French  Show original
19949966,Alessandro August 2019 Lucy was very helpful with everything and it’s was easy to get to the place. The room was clean and it manages to stay cool even in the summer heat so you don’t really need the A/C on to sleep well. Pelekas town is a short walk away (uphill)  but getting to the beaches on foot is quite taxing so a car or a scooter or any motorized vehicle are greatly recommended. Neighbors usually stay up late outside so don’t expect silence before at least midnight.
19949966,David October 2018 Apartment was neat and tidy outside area was nice. Pick up from airport much appreciated.
19949966,Manfred October 2018 We enjoyed very much staying in Zairas appartment  all was very nice  Zaira and here mother are very friendly and helpful for everything  romantic flair decorated appartment with nice details  wonderfully located with 5 beaches accessible with a bit of walk down to the sea  a nice place  thank you Zaira.
19949966,Iwona October 2018 Very relaxed place with large private terrace. Just few minutes (walk) to Pelekas village or Kontogialos beach (car recommended as apartment is on a hill). Very friendly  helpful host!
19949966,Natalie September 2018 Great communication  great location close to town  clean and would recommend. Thanks!
19949966,Martin September 2018 great location where you feel at home
19949966,Alienor August 2018 The flat is in an excellent location in a charming village near the beach  market  restaurants. The terrasse is perfect to take some drinks and diner. Zaira is a lovely person. She help us few times and always with the smile. If you come in Corfou i recommand her flat 100%!
19949966,Agnieszka July 2018 very nice host! close to the city of Pelekas and the beach - a steep road. beautiful garden and climate of Greece :) Recommend:)
19949966,Eugeniusz June 2018 The place is very quiet and peaceful with a charming little garden. We spent very pleasant moments.
19949966,Max April 2018 Great host - very friendly and hospitable. Zaira and her mother were extremely helpful to us on numerous occasions! The place itself is very cosy and also very neat and clean. We were really impressed with it in real life! It has everything that is needed and we would definitely recommend it to anyone. It was also only a few minutes drive to the beach and to the Village of Pelekas. On finding the apartment don't fully rely on the GPS  just follow the road to Pelekas. We also loved all the little details on the inside and outside of the apartment!
19949966,Mehmet April 2018 Zaira‘s apartment is a very nice place to have sweet little home base from very you easily can explore korfu. The Interieur is more than comfortable and the communication was excellent. S very humble and kind host  thank you very much.
19949966,Eva September 2017 Zaira is very hospitable  she got us some first need groceries and she picked us up and drove us to the flat. She is really sweet girl tho. The flat is super nice and cute  it is very clean. The location is really cool if you don't plan your vacations just chilling on the closest beach  because it's on the hill  but is really good if you prefer going around Corfu. It's easy to get there from the center (bus 11)  and her house is just next to the last bus station. there is an angency in Pelekas (with really nice boss) where you can rent a scooter  and there are many cool restaurants  and awesome view on the top of Pelekas.
19949966,Patrik August 2017 The apartment is situated between the village and the beach so you are in the center of your needs. The apartment is very nice  quite  clean an better equipped than my room at home! Zaira is very nice and courteous. She will even welcome you with some basic foods for your first days. I would marry her if she wouldn't be already.
19949966,Stephane August 2017 Our journey at Zaira place was perfect The location is only 5-10 min walking to PELEKAS center that is a charming village by the way (with good restaurants). Zaira is the best host ever! She even came to pick up us at the airport…Inside the apartment  this is very clean  well decorated  well equipped and with the air-conditioning. Furthermore  there is a charming garden with lemon  olive and kumquat trees. In brief  this is probably the best option to stay at CORFU for reasonable price. Don’t hesitate any longer!!!  Notre sejour chez Zaira a été parfait. L’appartement qu’elle loue est à seulement 5-10 minutes à pied du village de PELEKAS qui est un superbe endroit authentique avec de bons restaurants. Zaira nous a très bien reçus  elle est même venue nous chercher à l’aéroport. A l’intérieur  tout est très propre (fraichement rénové)  joliment décoré  avec tous l’équipement nécessaire et l’air conditionné (indispensable !). De plus  il y a un joli jardin fleurie avec des citronniers  des oliviers et un arbre à Kumquat. En bref  c’est probablement le meilleur rapport qualité/prix sur Corfu….FONCEZ ! Show more
19949966,Ravaka August 2019 We didn't get a chance to meet Zaira  but we can say that she is a host available and ready to respond to our requests. We were greeted by Mrs. Lucy  who is very kind both to guide us to the accommodation and to give us directions to places to visit and the best restaurants in the area. She's always available and smiling. You're just minutes from Glyfada Beach and Pelekas Beach  on a quiet hilltop street  so it's best to have your own vehicle. It has a garden with a very nice table to dine or relax. On hot days it gets humid  luckily there is air conditioning. Very affordable price compared to other listings in the area and given the period. We hope to be back! Translated from Italian  Show original
19949966,Mathieu November 2018 Very good stay  Zaira is attentive and helpful. In addition  she is very responsive and friendly. There are two single beds attached to each other. We recommend this place. Translated from French  Show original
19949966,Luc August 2018 The accommodation has a very nice small garden. The room is spacious. Beautiful coves nearby. Translated from French  Show original

33436467,Skye October 2022 AMAZING! Beautiful property! Kitchen is nice  pretty stocked  has a blender but no food processor. Two coffee makers  one regular coffee machine with paper filters and glass container  and one cappuccino maker.  The view is even better than the photos. The walls are very nice and modern. Bathrooms are very nice. The lowered couch outside is epic and very clean for white cushions  perfect condition!!!  Olives trees surround the back side of the property!  Even the driveway is GORGEOUS with red flowers! Fantastic for photos!  AC units are nice  with clickers for every room  so each room can control their temp.  Thank Kostas & Anita for sharing your beautiful home with us! Show more
33436467,Joseph D. July 2022 amazing place to stay  like something out of a dream. Hosts were lovely and 100% recommend this place.
33436467,Harminder May 2022 Amazing place! Jill & Kostas were great hosts and the rest of the prestige villa team. They helped us in getting a car and offering fresh towels each morning. The villa and the view are amazing!
33436467,Julia April 2022 This places deserves 10 stars!! Everything about this place and our stay was perfect. The owners of this place were incredible and we can’t thank them enough. The images don’t even do the place justice - it is so much better in reality!! Thank you for having us!
33436467,Vanessa September 2021 It was so gorgeous! The Villa and his owner Jill and Kostas are awesome and so lovely. I can recommend a stay there to everyone. I can only advise you if you staying there with 8 People  rent two small cars because it could be complicated with the driveway. But Kostas is happy to help you. But all in all don’t hesitate to rent the villa! (:
33436467,Hp August 2021 Villa Anthelia is a very high standard villa. The view is marvellous from morning to incredible sunsets  as on the gorgeous pictures showing it . The owners (Costas G. and his wife Gill) and the agent Prestige Villas of Corfu are very helpful and gave us invaluable tips to make our journey memorable.  Don't forget your snorkelling gears as the sea   (small deck 200m bellow)  wonderfully clean and full of life . Special thanks to the Italian cook (Giulia Burdet) who offered so many good things as well as her incredible know how.
32757261,Aleksandra July 2022 Amazing place  right at the beach. Apartment is equipped with everything you may need. The view is gorgeous and you can just hop to the sea and then relax in The privacy of the garden. You might need a car though  the restaurants that are within walking distance are not very nice and quite pricey. There are amazing places 10-15 minutes away from the property.
32757261,Alejandro April 2022 Wifi didn’t work
32757261,Ilta August 2021 The perfect place for a family with young kids. Waking up everyday to that view is what I am going to miss the most. The house is right on the beach a sandy beautiful shore. Parking space reserved inside the resort  really helpful in a fully packed place. The place was 30min distance by car from Corfu old town  which at first we thought was a bit long but we got to drive nearly every night there. Near Glyfada there’s also Pelekas  with nice restaurants and cocktail bars. I wouldn’t waste my time and money on the restaurants near the house  expensive and not very friendly service.
32757261,Alexander July 2021 If you like to be close to the beach but nevertheless be able to explore the whole island from a central location you have found the perfect spot! We wil definitely be back for another stay!
32757261,André September 2020 The Appartment was incredible. It is directly located at the beach  only a few steps it needs. The beach and the view you will have from the terrace is just amazing. By the way  in our opinion Glyfada has one of the most scenic and beautiful beachs on Corfu. So all on all I can highly recommend this apartment. If there were any questions George was always available.
32757261,Oliver October 2019 Gorgeous location and while staying in the off-season means you may have to rely more on provisions brought from Corfu town  the solitude gained is ample reward.
32757261,Ibrahim September 2019 Great ocean front condo overlooking the west side of the island  worth a visit if you are in Corfu. Short drive into town and to other beaches.
32757261,Luzia June 2019 Very beautiful view  amazing beach! You definitively need a car. Within 10 minutes drive you‘ll find very good Greek tavernas.
32757261,Laurence April 2019 We had a geat Time. The flat is ideally situaded at the end of the beach in front on the shore  sitting on the grass of the garden  quietly toes in the sand and the view of the waves . Spiros is very friendly and kind.
32757261,Pauline September 2022 Very nice place and amazing views. Translated from French  Show original
32757261,Jürgen October 2021 The location of the apartment is top and the amenities good. You are right in the front row on the beach. In the off-season  it is very quiet and the garden is very well maintained. I would come back. Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Llewellyn October 2022 Amazing! Beautiful! Dimitrios is a great host! Very helpful and charming. The apartment is clean and lovely. The location is perfect. The view is stunning. 10 out of 10. We will be back 😊
13245126,Karolis October 2022 Lively place  great location to go anywhere in the island. Around 15min from airport 👌
13245126,Richard September 2022 Absolutely Fantastic Host   wanted for nothing and super helpful. Available for any questions we had and gave some great recommendations to make our stay memorable .
13245126,Debora September 2022 Highly raccomanded  the apartment is amazing and super cozy. From both the balcony you will have a stunning view and a beautiful swimming pool.
13245126,Veronika August 2022 Very comfortable  large apartment  fully equipped. Very close to Corfu town  Aqualand and sandy beaches. Pool is also large and clean with sunbeds. All in all perfect but be sure to arrive with a small car.
13245126,Thomas August 2022 Dimitrios is a perfect host. the apartment is clean  the pool is big  you can contact dimitrios whenever you want. we loved it !
13245126,Sarah July 2022 Lovely Appartment  with some fantastic views and a really nice pool ! just a walk away from the picturesque village of Pelekas. Our host Dimitris was so welcoming and always at the end of a call if needed. We've had a wonderful holiday .
13245126,Eric June 2022 Excellent host who saw to our every need. Great apartment  well equipped & lovely clean pool. 5 stars. !
13245126,Way Off Kamil June 2022 A very nice place as a base in every direction of the island.  We were practically alone during our stay  so the pool was used practically only by us!  Very good contact with the Dimitrios  which was very helping!
13245126,Barbara May 2022 Apartment is spacious   clean with all amenities needed for your stay You definitely need a car to get to the beaches and to see the sights There is however a bus stop within walking distance to Pelekas and Corfu town The pool is lovely The views are stunning 10/10 We would definitely stay here again Barbara and Paul
13245126,Nina October 2021 Great appartment  in a central location with everything you need and a wonderful host.
13245126,Isabelle October 2021 Dimi is THE BEST HOST - responds to every request within minutes and gets everything sorted and arranged for you. Could not have asked for anything better. The location is great to access everywhere around the island (definitely get a rental car). We were totally spoiled having him as a host  thank you again!
13245126,Vlinder Juliet July 2021 A very nice apartment with a beautiful view and pool  I would recommend to rent a car if you want to explore the island.
13245126,Gilles June 2021 We enjoyed our stay at the apartement. The location to explore the island is perfect  the swimming pool was a nice ending on hot days. the apartement has everything you need and Dimi is always standby for extra tips and information.
13245126,Łukasz July 2020 We spent a great week in this apartment. The apartment is clean  comfortable and well equipped. The pool is big  clean and with a amazing view. Location is quiet which was good for us. I recommend renting a car to comfortably explore the nearby beaches. Dimitris was really nice  helpful and available at all times. I recommend this place to everyone :-)
13245126,Zdeno October 2019 Very nice place  very comfortable  perfectly equipped  with a good taste. Dimitrios is very kind  caring and helpful. House is out of a crowd but close to interesting points  with an amazing view from the pool and beautiful beaches very close.
13245126,Caroline October 2019 The accommodation was spotlessly clean  spacious and fully equipped with everything. It was peaceful with beautiful views from the balcony. The pool area was lovely  a really sunny spot to relax and enjoy the gorgeous sunshine. Not far from the village but it was a bit of a climb  but there are great cafes and tavernas there  offering lovely views. The Taverna just a few mins walk away  down the hill from the apartment was great  really delicious food. It is worth hiring a car if you want to explore the island and all its stunning scenery and views. Dimitris  our host  was available to contact and responded immediately  and was really helpful and friendly. A really lovely holiday.
13245126,Helen September 2019 Dimitrios is an excellent host and could not have been more helpful. He phoned as soon as we had landed to check where to meet him and then gave directions directly to our taxi driver arranging to meet at the taverna as apartment not too easy to find. I would highly recommend hiring a car which we did after the first day and realised the treck to the beach and back was too much and we are pretty fit. Pelekas beach is just perfect and the sea crystal clear. Corfu town is a 15 minute drive and such lovely places to eat and wander around.
13245126,Angela August 2019 Fantastic apartment in a beautiful location and great views from the pool and veranda  especially at sunrise. Just the right size and facilities for myself and 2 teenage children. Good sized pool and a blessing in the August heat. Take the shortcut through the olive groves into Pelekas village; takes just 7-8 mins  follow the well trodden footpath behind the apartments. Good choice of restaurants  Pink Panther and Acropolis for great views. Beach is beautiful  it's just a real trek! Dimitris was a fabulous host  kept in touch to make sure we were ok and very quick to respond to any questions I had during our stay. Thank you!
13245126,Carol July 2019 Lovely stay here. Dimitri a great host  stayed in touch with us during our stay. It was great to have a car and explore the beaches that Dimitri suggested. Apartment very comfortable and had all we needed. Discovered some beautiful bays and great tavernas in the area. A car or transport is very useful but not essential if you like walking. Thankyou for the hospitality
13245126,Marta June 2019 Amazing stay at Dimis place lovely  cozy apartment very clean.private swimming pool. Short distance to pelekas village and the best beach in our opinion-kontogialos beach.amazing views and tavernas on the beach. Hopefully see you again in Corfu. Thanks!
13245126,Cheryl May 2019 Lovely property  Dimitrious always available with any queries needed. Property lovely and clean near to the village. We had a lovely time and hope to return soon.
13245126,Inga April 2019 Dimitrios is a wonderful  hospitable and very careful host. The fabulous view from the balcony and pool area allows you to unwind and enjoy fantastic relaxation. The house is nice and cozy  maybe the kitchen might be a little bigger  but overall we did well. Dear gifts  both on arrival and on departure -we were delighted by heart. AirBnb pearl  we recommend!
13245126,Alexander October 2018 Dimitrios is a very friendly host and even gives you small gifts! The appartment is big  clean and well equiped. It is near pelekas  a lovely small traditional town. There is a nice little bakery on the corner of the main square you definetly should visit. Thank you dimitrios for the relaxing stay!
13245126,Josephine September 2018 Everything was great and very clean!!! Dimitris was a great host  suggested us places to visit in the island and almost everyday we had a communication with him either checking if we needed anything or suggesting us places
13245126,Mrs & Mr Preisner August 2018 Very nice appartment with 2 balconies and amazing view  very comfotable for 2  near the Pelekas  good communicated with Corfu town by bus. For exploring the island it is better to rent a car. Everything what needed to stay is there. We recommend the place :)
13245126,Lara August 2018 My children and I had a lovely time at Dimitrios's apartment. It was very clean and Dimitrios is a generous and kind host who welcomed us personally and was easily contactable if we needed any advice. We enjoyed the pool and balconies and the apartment is in a great location for exploring the area. We hired a car  which I would recommend but it's only a short drive to some lovely clean beaches and the village. Thanks for a great time in Corfu!
13245126,Freek July 2018 The house is perfect in every way so no additional comments needed there. There is a small track going up the hill to the lovely village of Pelekas  which is a great hangout for your morning coffee or an afternoon drink. After that dive in the giant pool with a view or a short drive to Corfu city (really nice) or Glyfada beach (the best beach on Corfu in our opinion). Our host had a terrible week with some personal losses due to the fires in Athens  but amazingly he still showed up at our doorstep to see how his guests were doing...so Dimitrios: you are a tremendous host and on top of that a very kind and nice man. Thanks again!
13245126,Maroeska July 2018 My boyfriend and I had 2 amazing weeks in the apartment of Dimitrios. It's a nice place for young and old. Dimitrios is always there for you. We were even allowed to enter the house earlier! The house is clean  we didn't miss anything. The view on the balcony is great and we had a beautiful view when we were relaxing at the pool! The apartment is near to Pelekas: a cute village with nice  affordable restaurants. We rent a car for 2 weeks  that is a good option to explore the island. I recommend this place to everyone :-)
13245126,Jo June 2018 From the moment we made our first enquiry to the moment we departed Dimitrios was helpful. The apartment is clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the morning sun on the balcony and evening sun by the pool. I would recommend your own transport. We did walk to the beach and into Pelekas but the climb back up from the beach is fairly tough. Pelekas has some lovely restaurants and the bakers on the square has lovely pastry’s. Don’t miss trying Sonja’s taverna which is the traditional white and blue building at the far end of the beach. We did try other beaches but Pelekas was our favourite.
13245126,Fiodor June 2018 The apartment was everything you need on a sunny holiday in Greece. We thought we wouldn't use the swimming pool but we actually loved it  so did our 9 month old baby. Dimitrios was an amazing host  our flight was delayed by hours but he still personally met us at 12 at night near the local Taverna. We also traveled to different beaches in Corfu but found Pelekas Beach was the cleanest and least busy with tourists.
13245126,Laura June 2018 Lovely vacation and pleasant stay at Dimitrios. Very attentive and sweet host. We stayed in April for a week and felt like we had the whole place to ourselfes  very quiet and relaxing. Pelekas is a calm area with a few tavernas up on the hill. We wanted to expirience the whole island so we did not stay in one place for the whole time. The pool was an amazing spot to chill and freshin up. I would def recommend this apartment. Thank you!
13245126,Markus April 2018 Dimitrios was an amazing host  we couldn't have asked for more!
13245126,Eliza April 2018 Fantastic apartment and surroundings  much better than in the pictures. The apartment is perfectly clean  cosy  has really everything that you need for your stay. The bathroom is brand new and very stilish. The view from the balcony and the swimming pool is breathtaking. The localization couldn't be better. Dimitrios is a great host  who really takes care of his guests. Totally recommended!
13245126,Helen October 2017 Really enjoyed our stay at Dimi's place in Pelekas! Great little apartment with amazing views. Pelekas is a lovely village with great restaurants  incredible views and close to lots of amazing beaches. Dimitrios was great at keeping in touch and gave us lots of tips. Thanks for a great stay!
13245126,Margus September 2017 Place was nice and cozy and not far away from small village Pelekas. The host was very helpful with everything.
13245126,Sophie September 2017 Very nice host! The housing is perfect for holidays! No parking place in front of the apartment but there is plenty of space along the road.
13245126,Griober August 2017 The apartment is placed in a quit area with a nice view. For a family it is needed to have a car to enjoy all beautiful beaches around  as well as marvelous island Corfu.
13245126,Lucille July 2017 It is a beautiful and quiet place  you can reach great beaches in 5 or 10 minutes with a car  Corfou old town in 20 minutes! If you want to relax  the pool is very big and the water always warm  with a wonderful view to the sea and mountains. In the apartment you have everything you need to have a great vacation! :) Dimitrios parent's welcomed us  they were very lovely and tell us everything we needed to know! I will recommand this peaceful place to everyone ! ;)
13245126,Rebecca June 2017 Host was great  made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Location is quiet which was good for us. Would recommend renting a car to explore the area and access all the great beaches that are near by.
13245126,Leo June 2017 Absolutely great 5 days in such a relaxing location near the small village of Pelekas - Dimitri was a very attentive host always happy to help and very quick to reply to any and every query we had  would definitely stay here again!!
13245126,Sonja & Adam June 2017 Dimitrios is such an amazing host. From the moment of check in to check out he made sure everything was perfect. The pool is great and balconies on his place overlook a wonderful view. The area is really cute and a very short and beautiful walk into town. I would definitely recommend you get a car for hopping around Corfu.
13245126,Frances May 2017 The apartment is clean  comfortable and well equipped. The view from the terrace is wonderful. We enjoyed the pool and it's not far to the village where there are shops and restaurants. We had an excellent holiday.
13245126,Tomas September 2016 Dimitri's apartment was the best choice to stay on Corfu  We had an incredible stay  apartment was very well furnished  there's everything we needed  welcoming was awesome  friendly and from the first moment we felt very well. The apartment has been kept very clean. Dimitri was very helpful and always readily available to answer our questions and give us tips. The apartment itself is in a perfect location  with an amazing view  all area was clean and pool wonderful. Recommend visiting the apartment if you want to spend a beautiful holiday in Greece.  Dmitri was an excellent host  we had a great time and would gladly come back again.
13245126,Katie August 2016 Dimitrios was very helpful throughout - both before we arrived and had questions including arranging wi-fi access and throughout our stay he responded quickly to messages. The apartment was perfect for our family of 4 which included 2 teenagers who very much enjoyed the pool and the location was ideal for our first visit to Corfu. A fantastic holiday - thank you! Response from Dimitrios Andreas August 2016 Thank you very much for your excellent comments.I m very happy that you've had such a nice time in Pelekas .I hope to see you again.

13245126,Cam August 2016 One of the best holidays ever. Landlord was very helpful and he paid attention to every detail to make us feel in Pelakas like in the paradise. Nothing to complain about. Thank you Dimitris! Response from Dimitrios Andreas August 2016 It was a pleasure having you as a guest I am so pleased that you had a pleasant stay and that you enjoyed my house and the location.
13245126,Mette July 2016 I enjoyed the holiday in 9 days with my two daughters aged 15 and 18. We had booked Dimitrios apartment  because it matched our desire for swiming pool  when we were not just for the beach. It was a good choice. The apartment is perfect placed near Pélekas  with beautiful views to the landscape  from the small terrace. We enjoyed the atmosphere. The best beaches are nearby  which we thought was fantastic. Dimitrios was a great host and we felt very welcome. I can only recommend Dimitrios apartment  if you go to Corfu. Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 I'm really glad you had a nice time at Corfu thank you very much for your kind words  I'm pleased you've had a nice time with your daughters . I'd love to have you as guests again. Translated  Show original
13245126,Tereza July 2016 Our stay at Dimis apartment was great. Apartment is big enough  there is balcony with a nice view and the pool is also perfect. We recieved bottle of wine  some fruit and pack of drinkable water  which was super cool. I would recommend to anyone who is not afraid of walking or has a car/scooter. There are hills everywhere but it's probably what makes Corfu so nice. Thanks Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 Tereza and Ondrej were fantastic guests  very nice and tidy persons. I would recommend them to every host I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
13245126,Elisabeth July 2016 Holiday at Dimitris were great. Apartment is beautifully situated. Views of the entire island are wonderful. The place is quiet. Dimitris provides everything you need when it comes to equipment. We felt pleasantly treated to. The distance to the town  shops and restaurants is close - it's very important. Pelekas is a very atmospheric location with nice people. Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 Thank you very much for your kind review  I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
13245126,Lena October 2022 Dimitrios welcomed us very warmly and provided us with tips and recommendations throughout the stay. The location of the AirBnB is ideal to get to great beaches and downtown in a short time. There is a small deduction for cleanliness - apart from that  it all worked out. Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Amandine August 2022 great welcome from Dim the accommodation is perfect!!! the pool is very nice Dim was very attentive to us The accommodation is well located 5 min walk from Pelekas ideal for visiting the west coast and 15/20 minutes from Corfu city we highly recommend it!!! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Julien Et Caroline July 2022 Excellent hosting by Dimitrios who deserves the full title of Superhost He checks in with us during the stay and is good tips for excursions and places not to be missed The pool was rarely occupied by other tenants  the opportunity to enjoy it quietly with family The accommodation is well located (close to Corfu and the beach...) and very well furnished We had a lovely vacation for this first in Corfu Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Jevgenij June 2022 Very quiet and beautiful place. Perfect for a family holiday if you are planning to rent a car and get around the island. Dimitri is always available and solves any questions. Translated from Russian  Show original
13245126,Christelle August 2021 Great stay  very well located accommodation to travel the entire island. Dimitri is very welcoming and accessible. They're very quick to respond to your questions. It is available even for a very late arrival. So really I recommend it. great place with great pool Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Oliver August 2021 Super accommodation in a great location. Very friendly host who was always available. Excellent pool. We will be back! Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Anne September 2019 Dimitrios was very patient and friendly to wait for us  our plane was more than 4 hours late which made us arrive after midnight. The residence is located next to pretty beaches   good restaurants   Pélekas is a pleasant city and it is very well located for visiting the whole island . On the other hand  we found our apartment poorly soundproofed  at the back of the residence with a not terrific view  and especially the feeling of having noisy neighbors who hung out the furniture every night and morning  which was not great for trying to sleep. I recommend requesting an apartment located on the 1st floor to avoid its nuisance. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Γιάννης August 2019 Great place! Translated from Greek  Show original
13245126,Lamprini August 2019 THE IMAGE OF THE POOL DOES NOT REFLECT THE REALITY  THE STRUCTURE THAT APPEARS TO BE NEIGHBORING. THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US ON A DIFFERENT SPOT THAN THE ONE IN THE PHOTO. BUILDING IS ABANDONED  ABANDONED  WITH VERY DIRTY YELLOW POOL  ISOLATED  IN THE ENTRYWAY HAS TOO OLD STRUCTURE WITH BROKEN SHUTTERS. IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR FAMILIES AND NOT SAFE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  WE IMMEDIATELY CHECKED OUT AND THE LANDLORD PAID US ALL BACK IMMEDIATELY. VERY COOPERATIVE BUT WE HAVE ENJOYED A GREAT DEAL OF ACCOMMODATION IN AUGUST. Translated from Greek  Show original
13245126,Susanne July 2019 Very good place to relax. From this location you can easily reach the Pelekas village and the nearby beaches. It's best to rent a car ! The apartment is very clean and my pool a real plus. Dimitrios is very attentive to his hosts. To be repeated. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Marielle July 2019 One more positive review for Dimitris. The accommodation is very clean  ideally located  the location is peaceful and close to Pelekas beach which is great! Dimitris can be reached at any time and takes great care for his tenants. The pool is a real plus. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Anna June 2019 Perfect stay  well-equipped house  beautiful view  relaxation and nice pool. Perhaps the only thing is parking under the house is a little uncomfortable and at risk of touching the car ; there is still parking along the street convenient and not far away. There are mosquitoes but the house is equipped with mosquito nets and stoves . With Dimitrios we only saw each other for check in  which was very fast despite our flight delay. She was always very helpful and kind on the phone. He arranged for us to rent a car perfectly and we had no problems. I wish I could go back ! Translated from Italian  Show original
13245126,Antoine June 2019 Great location with a pool. 15 min from Corfu old town and not too far from the beaches. Clean and nice accommodation. What a great stay Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Екатерина May 2019 Dimitrios's apartment is a wonderful place with a wonderful host. He contacted us in advance  answered questions  met us despite our late arrival. As a gift  we received wine and sweets - we had a birthday and wedding anniversary.  The place is as described. It was just me and my husband. In general  the apartment is designed for 4  but in my opinion  it is more comfortable for two. The kitchen had all the necessary utensils  as well as spices  oil  coffee  water in bottles. The washing machine worked without any problems. Clean linen  disposable slippers  towels. As well as sunbeds by the pool.  The balconies have a beautiful view of the island. You can see the greenery  the city  and the sea. The pool is clean  Dimitrios has its own sunbeds for guests.  The only downside was we were cold for a long time. First of all  because of the weather. It rained and it was windy. We turned on both the air conditioner and the heater. It still got cold. The floor is stone. Just in case  take warm slippers.  Overall  we are very satisfied with our stay and communication with Dimitrios. He loves and cares about his guests. I would recommend this apartment. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
13245126,Heike April 2019 We enjoyed staying in the small apartment from the extremely friendly and helpful host Dimitris. For example  we asked for a coffee maker...the next morning there was one at the door early. We have arranged with the large single duvet. The location of the apartment is strategically located. You can walk to Pelikas  park well and get easily by car from there to other destinations. The value for money is good. Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Chloe September 2018 We had a great week  the apartment is very well located  25 minutes from the center of Corfu and the airport  largely comfortable for 4 people  the pool is the big plus after a day of sightseeing  everything is functional in the apartment  and Dimitrios takes care of small touches  we recommend this great host and this great place! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Chloé August 2018 My boyfriend and I had a lovely vacation at Dimitrios! The place was very clean  very pretty and the pool beautiful with a great view. The apartment is very well located as near the charming village of Pelekas as well as a few kilometers from Corfu Town. It also has a very good location to access different parts of the island without having to travel too many miles. Dimitrios is a great host  available  responsive  concerned about the smooth running of the trip and very friendly. Thanks again! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Melitta July 2018 The apartment superbly tastefully furnished  the amenities everything available  the location a dream... Dimitrios was always available and very helpful....We felt wonderfully comfortable..The pool and the view of the island fantastic. We will definitely come back :-) Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Imkea May 2018 This apartment complex is located on the road to Pelekas  a short half hour walk from the bakery in the village. We were there with our 2 children who slept on the sofa bed. The space may not be very spacious  but it's fine  especially because you're outside a lot. The apartment has 2 small balconies  we had moved 2 chairs so that the four of us had breakfast on one balcony in the morning. From Pelekas you can go anywhere to explore the island. Dimitrios is very nice and will be there for you if you need him. Translated from Dutch  Show original
13245126,Pascal April 2018 Dimitrios takes care of 100% of its guests  welcome at all hours  immediate answer for any question... The accommodation is impeccable and matches the photos: superb view of the pool (even more grand a 5-minute drive from Kaiser's trone)  quiet and spacious; 2 minutes from a nice village  Pelekas  with good restaurants; 10 minutes from Glyfada  one of the beautiful beaches of the island and 1/4 hour from the capital. Only regret  that the terraces are a little small to eat for 4  and that there are not 4 chairs by the pool to be able to eat there while enjoying the view! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Μιλτιάδης-Κωνσταντίνος August 2017 Very nice little house and very convenient! quite close to the city of Cyprus but also to nice beaches. Both Demetri and his parents are very accommodating! Frequently contacted and helped with everything we needed! Translated from Greek  Show original

9599653,Claire September 2022 First visit to Corfu and we have had a great time  truly relaxing. Agios Ioannis is so charming and the family owned Taverna in the village square welcoming. The gardens here are stunning and the pool simply perfect. Highly recommended!
9599653,Michelle September 2022 Villa Theodora is a lovely Villa in a quiet rural location. Fantastic swimming pool and outdoor area. A car is recommended.
9599653,Mark August 2022 This house is fantastic  the photos on the listing do not do it justice. It is light  spacious  airy  well furnished and stocked. The garden is lovely the pool is perfect - it also has a shallow end that 2 year olds can stand up in. All the bedrooms were spacious. The area is fairly quiet  but there is taverna in walking distance and in 2 minute drive you have a supermarket  bakery  restaurants - and Aqualand. This is probably the best house I have stayed in and I have stayed in a lot all over the world! Can not recommend enough for a peaceful  comfortable  tranquil getaway Peter is nearby  on hand and very eager to make sure everything is ok. 10 out 10.
9599653,Ann-Marie August 2022 Stayed for a week in this lovely villa that sits on the edge of a quiet village. Peter was a great host who gave us a warm welcome and thoughtfully provided some essential foods to get us set up. Plenty of clean linen and towels. It is spacious and cool and the pool was thoroughly enjoyed by us all! We were two adults and three kids under age 11. This is a good base to access Glyfada beach  Pelekas (beautiful views) Corfu Old Town and Aqualand. I recommend hiring a car to get around  which Peter helpfully arranged for us in advance. Good local taverna and food shop nearby. We enjoyed our stay!
9599653,Carol-Anne May 2022 This beautiful villa is only recommended. It was even nicer than in the pictures. The house  the garden and the pool are very well maintained  everything was very clean. When we arrived there were already a few things to eat and drink. Peter is a great host! He was very helpful right from the start  gave us lots of tips for the island. Gladly again☺
9599653,Benedicte April 2022 We had a really lovely time at Villa Theodora. The house is spacious and comfortable with a really lovely garden  and a great location: just off a main road that takes you to some of the best places on the island  and just 15 minutes from the airport. Peter welcomed us even though we arrived late  had bought some food for our breakfast  and replied to all our queries very quickly and helpfully. I highly recommend Peter's house to anyone wanting a home from home on Corfu.
9599653,Irena April 2022 Peter absolutely deserves the “superhost” title. He is very kind  friendly  responsive and helped us with every request or question we had. The photos of the villa are very accurate. It’s very beautiful and spacious  the garden is big and full of green trees and plants. We had 2 dogs and they definitely appreciated this outside area. Near the villa (3mins walk) is Costa’s taverna where they cook very nice and fresh Greek meals and you’ll also get to know about the history of this village if you ask the lady who works there. We loved every second of our stay and we’ll definitely come back. Peter was so nice that he even helped us with a lost ID card and he will send it to us via post. Thanks Peter!
9599653,Omar October 2021 It was amazing. From the start right till the end. Great communication  great villa and quite convenient located. The villa was superb and well equipped. Peter was always available should we need it something and quite accommodating as our flights were delayed because of the weather. If I come back to Corfu I’ll deffo look into booking again!
9599653,Jan October 2021 It was a beautiful stay at Peter‘s house. The swimming area is very nice specially when the sun is kicking (: Also the communication between us and Peter was always on point and he got some useful tips for us (beaches  scooter rental  etc.) We are lloking forward to come again. best theresa and jan
9599653,Mathilde August 2021 Great location to visit the island. Great pool and beautiful garden. Few steps away from the picturesque central place of the old village  with a wonderful traditional taverna. Other than that  few eating and shopping options nearby  a car is definitely needed.
9599653,David July 2021 Very nice and pleasant villa to stay. The village is well located to explore the north of the island. Excepted the Aqualand park which is out of the village  it’s an authentic place  with a local taverna far from the mass of the tourists. We love it and it’s nearly 15 minutes from the center of Kerkyra. Peter is a great host  he gave us very good advices and was present during our stay to communicate with us. We strongly recommend to stay here
9599653,Paul June 2021 Absolutely outstanding! Perfect place to stay if you have a rental car and want to experience the different beaches! We stayed three nights with our four kids (6 total). Day 1 we went to Paleokastritsa and Glyfada beaches. Day two we drove to Sidari and went to Canal d'Amour  Sidari Beach  Peroulades  and Porto Timoni. On day three we went to Dassia and visited Corfu Town. Unfortunately  Aqualand was not open. The location of the house was perfect for all events.  House: Patio and pool were the perfect way to start and end end days. We ate dinner on the patio  and the kids loved it. Kitchen has a large refrigerator and a washing machine which enabled us to pack lightly. The bedrooms were awesome -- very comfortable beds  air conditioning units  and blackout shutters that kept the rooms very dark. Very clean throughout and all modern amenities.  Host: The best Airbnb host we have had! Check and and out were very smooth  communication was outstanding through WhatsApp  and he had tremendous recommendations for the area. He arranged for a rental car for us to be brought to the house (and dropped off at the airport). Also: Peter speaks perfect English  which is extremely helpful.  Please note: on Corfu you MUST have your international drivers license with you in order to rent a car. I've rented cars in a lot of places  this is the first one that required the document to be in your possession.  Location: Beautiful view!!! In a small village with an easy walk to a bakery in the morning  outstanding restaurants for dinner  and a grocery store anytime. We didn't visit  but there is also winery very close by. Perfect for Aqualand -- five minute drive away.  Value: Outstanding! Well worth the price.  Overall: I'd give Peter 6 stars if I could! We would definitely rent again  and we cannot recommend this any higher for your vacation to Corfu. Show more
9599653,Tanguy June 2021 We had a great time at the Villa Theodora and Kostas was a great host providing with all the help so we could enjoy our stay in the house and on the island. The house is very well located  not too far from Corfu and close enough to beautiful beaches. We could also spend a full day in the house just to relax and enjoy the pool. Kostas was kind enough to check on us and help us with what we needed  being very quick to come back to us with our requests. We highly recommend the place.
9599653,James September 2020 Brilliant host  gave us amazing travel and activity advice. Beautiful house with tonnes of ammenities  the air conditioning was perfect B) Lovely area very close to bus services Would totally come again!
9599653,Colin August 2020 A gorgeous Villa in an ideal location to explore the whole Island. The whole family enjoyed the villa  from the sizeable pool to al fresco dining on the terrace. The stay was further enhanced by the friendliness of the host Peter and all his help with local tips from best beaches  tavernas and boat hire. Also the Hospitality from Lula in the local Taverna  Costas  We would highly recommend a stay at this villa and if we return to corfu we will be back.
9599653,Francesca August 2020 My friends and I stayed here for a week and had the most amazing time. The villa was much more spacious and beautiful than the pictures suggested  well worth the money! Location was convenient as not far from the airport  Corfu town and the amazing Glyfada beach  however a car would be recommended as taxi’s add up. Peter was an amazing host helping us with our itinerary (boat trip  beaches  clubbing- whatever you want!)  rental cars  taxis and replied quickly. The village is really authentic and everyone we met was so friendly. We would definitely return.
9599653,Alberto June 2019 We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Theodora. It was perfect for our holidays on Corfu given its location not far from Kerkyra/Corfu Town which also allowed us to explore several places and beaches all around the island. Besides we loved the swimming pool! The communication was easy and quick and the hosts were always easily reachable. We are also thankful that they were so flexible with our arrival and departure time. We only have positive words about this stay!
9599653,Louise October 2018 My husband and I stayed at Peter's apartment and had a wonderful time. It was spacious and immaculately clean. The outside space and pool were beautiful and the location was nice and quiet so very good for relaxin  but still only a 15 minute drive away from Corfu town or a pretty village nearby called Pelekas. Peter was very helpful and quick to respond to messages. We would definitely stay again! Thank you!
9599653,Henna June 2018 Nice and restful spot  both children and adults enjoyed the pool! Hosts were very helpful and everything went smoothly. Worth a recommendation!

9599653,Sebastian July 2017 Kostas is a great host who endeavours really hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. He was quick to respond to all questions and offered sound advice on arrival and throughout our stay. He ensured the pool was clean and the bedlinen was changed. He was really friendly and we all wanted to make sure this review was published to encourage more AirBnBers to consider this as an amazing place to stay!
9599653,Udo May 2022 We enjoyed it very much. The only criticism point is the street in the valley opposite  which you can hear relatively loud in the evening. However  this would not stop us from visiting the house again. For questions of any kind  Peter was always available. Translated from German  Show original

9599653,Юлия June 2018 We were met by Peter  a very charming and sweet host! He met us near the water park and escorted us to the house! The house is a five-minute walk from the water park. The location of the house is very convenient in that you can get to any central part of the island equally quickly! We picked up our car at the airport and moved around the island freely. The house was as we expected  the back terrace of the house has a lovely garden and a chic pool! The water in the pool is clean and warm  the kids spent all their free time there! Peter was very responsive  helpful in a difficult situation   in which I really appreciate your help! Thank you and see you soon)))!!! Translated from Russian  Show original

624634481609085660,Michael July 2022 I cannot recommend enough this beautiful cottage! Elina was incredibly generous and responsive throughout and welcoming for my first trip to Corfu. The home’s location is ideal for exploring the island (a rental car is highly recommended  if not a must). It’s right if the main road between Corfu Town and Palaiokastritsa. The stone house has everything one could ask for in a vacation property. The only thing missing is faster wi-fi (there is a small dongle with very slow Internet). Really I cannot say enough good things about this property and Elina! 5 stars!
624634481609085660,Cheyenne July 2022 This place is the perfect place to relax; quiet  peaceful  and clean. Elina was super helpful with recommendations and communication- would definitely recommend!
624634481609085660,Alexandros July 2022 A peaceful place near the town. Clean  modern  comfortable and affordable. The hostess is very sweet and always available. Highly recommend!
624634481609085660,Benjamin June 2022 1. far but not to far from the city of Corfu. 2. more than enough outside space 3. amazingly friendly vibes 4. help for those needed if possible. 5. free bottle of wine 😁
624634481609085660,Morgan June 2022 Stunning place  highly recommend! Elina is so lovely and has great communication. Everything was spotless and in great condition. Such a calm and beautiful stay

Thank you Elina for your kindness and bravo for your project! we recommend 100% Translated from French  Show original
624634481609085660,Marina August 2022 Elina's house is in a natural setting that allows you to visit different areas of Corfu. We had everything we needed to enjoy a few pleasant days and she has been one of the best hosts we have ever encountered. We are very grateful for the recommendations you gave us and without a doubt our trip would not have been the same without your advice. Thank you so much for everything Elina!

The house is perfect for 1-2 people. The terrace and garden are great. You can look directly at the mountains. Very modernly furnished and it has everything you need. Very stylish  and cuddly decorated. I felt very comfortable.  It is about 20-30 minutes on foot to the beach  about 6 minutes by car and about 5-10 minutes by e-bike.  Corfu is great and the accommodation and Elina make the stay perfect. Thank you for everything Translated from German  Show original

14038695,Pierluigi August 2022 We stayed in Marieta’s guesthouse for eight days and we had a wonderful time. The house was very spacious even for ten people and the view was great. Anna’s parents welcomed us and they were fantastic  they gave us a lot of suggestions about beaches and taverns. The village of Varypatades is very picturesque and characteristic and you can really live the Greek lifestyle and feel the warmth of the people. We had even the chance to go to the traditional village party and we had a great time eating souvlaki and dancing with the locals. We definitely recommend Marieta’s guesthouse and hope to come back in the future.
14038695,Andriana July 2022 The home is located in a village that is in a great location  close to pretty much everything. The roads that lead to the house may be hard to navigate for unexperienced drivers but we appreciated the uniqueness and charm of the beautiful village and even more so the gorgeous views that unfold from the balcony of the home. The home is beautiful and spacious. It was perfect for our party of 9. Anna  the host  was responsive and helpful throughout our stay. Thanks Anna! We immensely enjoyed staying at your beautiful home!
14038695,Anastasia August 2021 What a wonderful place. We had an amazing time and Anna was so helpful. Will definitely book again here!
14038695,Claudio August 2021 Both the home and owners are gems. They are very welcoming. Their home is beautiful and spacious  located at the tippy-top of the charming village of Varypatades. Spectacular country side view  with many beaches about 20 min drive. The house is equipped with everything you might need. We had 6 adults  and we all were very comfortable here. There are 4 bathrooms  3 of which have showers. There are multiple beautiful balconies and terraces  and out door furniture to accommodate a family. A/C only on the first floor  but a nice breeze on the other two upper floors that have the bedrooms made sleeping comfortable enough. The house is furnished beautifully. The host gives a lot of information about near by restaurants  boat trips  etc. everything was perfect  thank you so much Anna!!!
14038695,Rodrigo July 2021 We spent 4 days and 3 nights at Anna’s. Our stay was amazing. My friends and I really enjoyed the house and the village. From the house you have a stunning view over the hills and the a part of the sea. The house is beautiful  spacious and well equipped. Anna is very available and arranging. Her parents are lovely and very welcoming. I highly recommend the Anna’s place for your stay in Corfu. Response from Anna July 2021 Rodrigo thank you so much for your kind words! It was great to host people like you in our house!! If you come back anytime in Corfu it will be our pleasant to open again our house to you!!!😊
14038695,Jerome August 2020 Nice house in a calm and typical village. Nice welcome and Nice view.
14038695,Niels September 2018 great house  beautifull views and lots of space  really you feel your on holiday.
14038695,Lena July 2018 We loved staying in this spacious and charming Greek house! The views were just amazing!! The house was full of original featers and gave it a lot of charm. We could really absorb a sense of Greek life and culture staying in this friendly little village.  You do need to rent a car to stay in this place  as the closest beaches were at least 15 minutes away by car. But we wouldn't have exprinced authentic Greek living if we stayed somewhere next to the beach  that's crowded with tourists and full of noise. The location is helpful geographically  as the house is pretty much in the middle of the island and it was never too far to get to places.  The hosts were so lovely  welcoming and kind. They couldn't do enough for you! They were quick in communication and provided helpful tips about places to visit or anything else we asked! They gave us somelovley gifts  which we as a nice touch. Their homemade rose wine was just amazing!  Would really recommend this house if you want to immerse yourself into the beauty and local charm of Corfu!

14038695,Nils September 2017 The villa is such a nice place to stay at  situated in a very tiny  cute and central village. The view is amazingly relaxing and calm. Both hosts were very welcoming. They provided us everything we needed  offered us drinks and food  and they even brought us fresh and delicious homemade ice creams during our stay! Thank you so much!
14038695,Vladimir August 2017 Astonishing house in the heart of the Corfu island. We was 2 families with 3 kids. Plenty of room and comfort for everyone. The house interior is a jewel  we needed one more week to stay to discover all small details. You can breakfast  drink coffee or have your dinner at a different huge terrace every time with amazing view day and night. Varipatades is situated at the approximate geometric center of the island  so you can explore Corfu best during your stay. We also discovered the most amazing taverna on the island 15 minutes away from the house by walk - just ask for Alex from Kalafationes. I was almost crying on the checkout  we'll be visiting that place again and again.
14038695,Filip July 2017 Very nice and big village house with beautiful view.
14038695,Silvia August 2016 the house is perfect for a group of five because has a lot of space. Infact there are beautiful terraces where is possible to have breakfast and beautiful dinners with an amazing view. The house is near the city center (ten minutes by car) but at the same time it is in the middle of the nature on a hill. It's perfect for who want to take a break from the daily routine. It is a luxury house  very big and comfortable! The owners are always helpful and kind for everything. When we arrived we found fresh water  something to eat for the breakfast and other welcome gift. All was great!
14038695,Pietro July 2021 Very spacious house with spectacular views of the hills of variados and the port of Corfu. Very helpful and always friendly host. For any eventuality  she responded quickly. Perfect for a group of friends on vacation  given the location it is better to have your own means Translated from Italian  Show original
14038695,Vassilis October 2018 The house enjoys the best location of this quaint and almost intact village that is Les Varypatades. Stunning views of the hills  nearby villages and the sea. Ideal location of the village  15’equidistant between the sea and the city of Corfu. Welcome and responsiveness assured. A very pleasant surprise. V. P.S. : In September and October  the island is just splendid and the service is a lot nicer Translated from French  Show original

14038695,Olga August 2018 We had a wonderful rest in this beautiful  wonderful house. Loved absolutely everything! First of all - lovely hosts  very delicate  intelligent people  it was very nice to communicate with them. We were welcomed warmly as dear guests  they told us about everything in detail  especially for us the hostess baked delicious buns - it is so pleasant. The next day  we were brought a huge plate of figs  just ripped from a tree  treated us to homemade wine  ice cream... It felt like we were visiting with loved ones. If we talk about the amenities in the house  everything was at the highest level - cozy  luxurious  beautiful. We were 8 people - 4 adults and 4 children  accommodated in 4 bedrooms. The house has 3 bathrooms  another toilet is shared in the living room. The kitchen is fully equipped  there are 2 coffee makers  and a stove  oven  dishwasher  washing machine  microwave  cappuccino machine  etc.  all appliances are very good. All utensils  appliances are available. There are all the consumables - laundry tablets  dishwasher  coffee etc.  of course  soap  toilet paper. The internet worked perfectly. There was always hot water. In general  everything is thought out for a carefree vacation. Household amenities are of course important  but the most important thing about this house is the soul  everything in this house is made with soul. Each room  every corner. I've been finding new details that I didn't notice right away. What kind of terraces are there! Magical views of the surrounding countryside. We loved sitting on the terrace and watching the sunset - it's insanely beautiful! Thank you very much again to the hosts for a wonderful vacation  I am still impressed. We came home today  drink tea with your lokoum and remember you... Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
14038695,Александр July 2018 The house is in a picturesque old village on a high slope. The house has a beautiful panoramic view of the hills  mountains and sea. The territory of the plot is not very large  but quite cozy. Parking near the house is possible but difficult due to the high slope of the road. The area around the house is quiet and picturesque. The house is beautiful and large  with wide balconies. The sea can only be reached by car through picturesque surroundings  villages with narrow and winding streets. We really enjoyed our stay.

33394245,Helen September 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at one of Theodores rooms. We loved the area around and the view from the balcony. This place is the best to escape from the trouble of big cities. Thank you so much Theodore  we will come back! Response from Theodore September 2022 Anytime Helen. I will be happy to host you again.
33394245,Helen August 2022 Very pleasant and helpful host! The location is beautiful and perfect for days at the beach  if you're not opposed to a small hike/walk.
33394245,Eva July 2022 This place has definitely a soul. I have stayed there for 3 weeks to work and to have some rest. Location was perfect for me as it is close to bus and you can get to Corfu town in 20 minutes. Also it is close to a lovely village called Pelekas. In Pelekas  there are held many events that can make you feel the greek vibes. You can go to a local bar and always have a chat with someone. In Theodore's house  you can enjoy sollitude and peace of mind as it is not in the centre of anything. The view from the balcony and the garden was something I enjoyed watching every day. It can be good for someone who needs to get out of the civilization and have some peaceful days. I would not recommend it to people who need a very high standard of luxury  especially the bathroom can be hard to get used to and also there is no air conditioning. Anyway  for me it had everything I needed to have lovely days. Moreover  you need to take care of the insects. Theodore and his mother were always so kind. Theodore was super helpful! I had a very beautiful stay and I hope I will come again.
33394245,Robin June 2022 You get what you pay for!! A small and nature based apartment with at least an awesome view from the balcony! The kitchen is well equipped with enough to live in during your stay! The apartment is in a good position to get the bus to Corfu town and the restaurants in Pelekas (up the hill 10-15min walk). Pelekas got the best bar on the island (Zanzibar) you should definitely go there. You can go to the beach by foot (45min!!)  but I would recommend to rent a bike/atv or car for that! Downhill is ok  but uphill is true pain!! Wifi is there..but not there..it’s way to slow..to even open up a website! Overall it’s a ok apartment and worth the money. It’s off from the rush and a good point to explore the island by Bike/ATV or car!
33394245,Yasmina September 2021 I had a great time at Theodores place. My expectations were exceeded. Theodore picked me up at the airport for 10€  which was way cheaper and more uncomplicated than taking a bus or taxi. We stopped at Lidl to get a few groceries for my stay. I loved the authentic room with the access to the big balcony where you can sit on a small table and enjoy your morning coffee or dry your clothes and towels troughout the day. The sun is rising directly on the window side  so you have a beautiful Sunrise to watch everyday. There is a big garden with fruits and vegetables  where theodores mother goes by once in a while. The bathroom is small and you shower exactly in the bathroom without a curtain  which was quite an experience and afterwards you have to mop up the leftover water. It’s not a hotel and that’s why I loved it even more. The kitchen was very big and equipped with everything you need for self-catering. The house is near pelekas  where you can rent a cheap scooter for about 20€ per day. So you can get fast to the beaches pelekas beach and glyfada beach  which was my favorite  because of its size where you find a calm place for a beach day. The beaches are in westward direction  which was perfect to watch the sun touching the sea. And from the house you can also get fast to Corfu town or to the Achilleion for example for some sightseeing. Down the street there was a beautiful taverna Staurodrómi  where great food is served. So everything fitted perfectly and Theodore made it a much better and easier stay with all the informations he gave me. He also drove me back to the airport. I would definitely recommend a stay at his house. Show more
33394245,Anna September 2021 What a luck I had with this place. The house has a positive Energy and Theodore is always there to help  when needed. We were on a budget  so the chance to cook in the kitchen  that has everything needed really helped. Drinking coffee on the Terrasse was very relaxing. The beaches around here and the water is very clean and the people all over Pelekas have been very friendly and welcoming. ..I warmly recommend staying at Theodores place! ...just one thing to note: the bed was a bit hard. Might not be for everyone. ❤️
33394245,Marius August 2021 The host was very helpful and friendly. responsive to questions and requests. the accomodation was fine. The bathroom not very appealing with the flush not being strong enough and the shower not being separate from the toilet. The bathroom would be very wet and not properly drain for ages after taking a shower. The bedrooms were fine(Mattresses on the harder side) except for there being no mosquito net over the window. The nets that were provided had a lot of holes and didn't work well so there weres some hot nights. Thankfully there was a fan provided. The kitchen was good and everything worked fine but the common areas(kitchen and living room) were never cleaned during our 11 day stay. All in all we would return since the price is very acceptable compared to other offers on Corfu.
33394245,Lukacs August 2021 Everything was great and I recommend the accommodation. we really loved this place. and we will go to next year also
33394245,Wojtek July 2021 Highly recommend :)
33394245,Klara November 2020 Great place  great value  good spot to explore Korfu from. Small village close by  to go around the island rent a car or scooter. We stayed for three weeks.
33394245,Olivia October 2020 Theodore’s house it’s a nice place. The mamma is very generous! We didn’t have any problems to contact Theodore. The house is not so tidy get ready for it. The Beach near the house is veeery nice :)
33394245,Cathleen September 2020 I loved being there. It's a wonderful place  with great energy and wonderful people.❤️
33394245,Matthäus September 2020 Beautiful location with a kitchen and garden. Nice sight towards the mountains from the window/balcony. The beach and the village are not so far away (15-20 min.of walking) And the host was always traying to help us with everything. We were glad to stay there during our holiday.
33394245,Jasmin August 2020 The house is super good located if you plan to discover the island  not too far from any location. Theodore is a nice host that gave us plenty of advice on local places to eat and beaches to visit. The house is basic and cozy  with all the utilities one might need. Overall I highly recommend this place!
33394245,Roman August 2020 I was at Theodores rooms with my girlfriend for 8 days. He picked us up from the airport for half of the taxi prize  but also told us about the option to travel by bus for 1 50 Euros which takes time though.  When we arrived he explained us everything and suggested us places to visit. Theodore is super nice and answers all questions.  The bathroom includes a shower  a toilet and a sink. You can not put toilet paper in the toilet but in a trash bin. This is the same for all of Corfu. You just shower in the bathroom which works fine and get warm water by pressing a button on a water boiler in the morning which is enough for the whole day.  The bedroom includes a fan and something against mosquitos of which there can be some in the night. Also the beds are really hard which was a problem for my girlfriend. I found them uncomfortable but had no problems sleeping.  The kitchen includes everything you could need.  From the balcony you can look in the garden. Theodores mother can sometimes be seen there and gifted us fresh tomatoes from the garden regulary.  We strongly suggest to get a scooter from Theodores scooter guy. We paid 17 Euros a day for a 50ccm scooter with 2 helmets and full insurance per day. With that you can easily explore the whole island because walking through the many mountains is quite hard even when the distances are not so long. With this small scooter we only had about 5 hills where I needed to drive up alone and let my girlfriend walk. Driving through the small villages  seasides and olive forests on the island with the scooter was the best experience we made.  Overall I strongly recommend Theodores rooms. You only need to watch out with the mosquitos and be prepared for the hard beds  everything else works out great! Show more
33394245,Moïse August 2020 Theodore is such a kind and welcoming host. I had a very nice time at Pelekas and he made sure everything went well. The view from my room was gorgeous and the interior was also designed very aesthetically. I was charmed by the beauty of the authentic village and the beaches not far away from it. Definitely recommend if you're a nature lover! Response from Theodore August 2020 Thank you Moise. Hope to see you again!
33394245,Alexandra September 2019 Theodore is a lovely host and really made an effort to make our stay as comfortable as possible! We were able to check in very early and leave our stuff at the premises after checking out until we left in the afternoon. He also provides his guests with his homemade olive oil for cooking  which tasted fantastic. The room was cosy and clean and the view from balcony made for romantic dinners under the moon. Highly recommended!
33394245,Matthias September 2019 Thanks for the very nice stay at your house  the transport and all the helpful tips! We had a great time in pelekas  glifada beach and on Corfu at all! 🙂 Cheers  Matthias
33394245,Łukasz July 2019 Theodore is a great host. We got detailed information and a map on how to get to his home. After our arrival  Theodore explained everything to us about the things in the house  where is a first aid kit  the main power switch  talked about the area and gave practical tips. The room and common space was consistent with the photos. We spent a great time in Theodore's house and on Corfu.

Only things to note: The beds are very hard (but we expected it having read the other reviews) and the Wi-Fi connection does not work inside the room. Theodore was very kind  and since our flight was in the evening  he allowed us to stay in the house as long as we wanted! Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original

A well-equipped shared kitchen with fridge is available. From the small balcony you have a really great view. However  like all apartments in this style  the rooms are very poorly soundproofed. You have to be able to live with that. We loved staying at Theodore's place and would be happy to recommend it. Translated from German  Show original

33394245,Saskia June 2019 I stayed in Theodore's house for 9 days. His mother lives on the upper floor and chats if you run into her in poor English. The house is located on a road that is further quiet. Especially in the evening  it's quiet. To the side and behind the house is a large garden with lots of trees. The garden has of course been left as I liked. Various beaches can be reached from the location. I had a scooter that Theodore had arranged for me and that makes it easy to visit places. In the house I could use a refrigerator with freezer  hotplates  sandwich maker and kettle. The only thing I missed was a bottle opener and a paraccol for when you want to sit on your balcony. Theodore is hospitable and even took me to my next stay the day I left because this was on his way. I had a nice time! Thank you! Saskia Translated from Dutch  Show original
4690117,Wendy August 2022 We were so happy to finally be in Corfu after delaying our stay for 2 years due to Covid and the owners being very accommodating of our changes. As others have said  the photos don’t do it justice as the setting is wonderful with amazing views which make you instantly relax. The villa is clean  very well equipped and maintained at all times with regular cleaning during our stay  which was great. A car is pretty essential due to the hilltop location but we loved the space  quiet & privacy due to no immediate neighbours. The pool was wonderful too! Definitely a holiday to remember - thanks to all the team!
4690117,Pip July 2022 Our family of ten including an infant and one young boy loved the time at this villa. Its facilities are great and it has a truly amazing location with exceptional views. The space for our party  the pool  and the generous provision of equipment were excellent.
4690117,Madison July 2022 Difficult to find  got lost many times trying to find the villa using the address  coordinates  etc. The host was very kind and came to meet us at a local taverna to show the way. Home is in the middle of the countryside and is quite hot in summer. A lovely place if you’re looking for seclusion and to feel completely away from it all.

4690117,"Karen August 2021 We booked Villa Kokkini because there were originally 7 in our group though only 5 ended up travelling - The villa was perfect  easy and quick to get to from the airport ( you will need a hire car)  there are no other villas anywhere near so it is very private and quiet - it's located at the top of a steep slope with its own gated private drive and has fabulous views.......making it a difficult choice as to whether to have morning coffee on the 1st floor balcony or the terrace! The villa itself is exactly as shown in the photos - As a party of 5 we had a comfy double sofa each to relax on  the kitchen was well stocked with equipment  there is air conditioning in each bedroom and the living area on the ground floor. The villa has good wifi  the pool is large with enough sun beds and sun shades. And a great location - 20 mins in to Corfu Town  less than 5 mins to Aqualand  a few miles away from Glifades and Eamones beaches (from the balcony you get a glimpse of the sea where Eamones beach is) though our favourite beach was Roda on the northern coast - about a 45 min scenic car journey away - very laid back with the beach front cafes all having very comfy well spaced out free (for your custom) sun beds though food/drink prices were pretty cheap and the beach itself very safe for kids. We stayed the last 2 weeks of August - it may have been due to the heat wave being experienced across Greece (I don't know) but  we didn't see a single mosquito so we came home with all of the mossie repellent that we took -it made eating out in the evening  pleasant. There always seems to be the odd wasp buzzing around wherever we went save for the beach but they buzzed off when batted away and didn't get angry so they had about the same ""irritation factor"" as house flies give in the UK. Makis cleaned the pool every morning and his daughter cleaned the villa and changed sheets/towels twice per week which made the stay very comfortable. If you arrive on a Saturday then make sure you get drinking water and food for a few days when you arrive as supermarkets don't open on a Sunday. And lastly  thank you to Makis (and family) - a really fantastic villa.

4690117,Jenna August 2021 Clean  spacious  private  beautiful villa! The Villa is perfectly located for being able to easily drive and visit different parts of Corfu. Thank you Makis for the wonderful stay my family and I had while on Corfu  and thank you for your helpfulness and communication throughout.
4690117,Aaron August 2021 Really nice  spacious  clean house with a pool that gets cleaned every morning. No direct neighbours  so it's very quiet. Nice view overlooking the green hills of Corfu. 15 min drive to the nearest beaches. Response from Gerasimos August 2021 thank you very much for your positive thoughts! hopping that we`ll welcome you again sometime in the future we are sending you our best regards stay happy  makis & staff Show more
4690117,Naomi July 2021 This holiday was 5* in every respect.  However beautiful the house looks online  you cannot compare it to real-life! The photos do not do justice to the pool  which is very big  catches the sun in every angle and is set inside a beautiful  old-time-style white-stone paved patio. There was fantastic seating around the pool too! The blue sun-loungers pictured were replaced with wooden sun beds that had full-length white cushions tied to them. All in all  the pool area had the feel of an exclusive 5* hotel  improved by the complete privacy of the area.  All balconies face the direction of sunset - which is absolutely beautiful - the hazy pink set in the rich green of the undulations.  We were absolutely blown away by the hospitality of our hosts. First thing is when we arrived there at night  Makkis informed us that we can't drink tap-water; being that we did not have a car  he went down to purchase some water for us. The next day  he offered to do our shopping for us; when one of our group was ill  he went to the pharmacy to purchase medication for them. The host came eearly morning every day to clean the pool and water the plants around the villa.  On one occasion  we got locked out of the villa; Makkis came up on his motorbike and then walked downthe hill (the proeprty is set on a huge amount of steeply-inclined land) to get a ladder  which he then proceeded to climb up so that he could get through a tiny bathroom window to let us in!  A note for future guests - a car is really a necessity here as the house is quite secluded at the top of a small hill and Kokkini itself is not near many beaches etc. (Ermones is the only close beach - it is a 10 minute drive and is breathtaking at sunset!) Show more
4690117,Natasha June 2019 This place was Heaven! The accommodations were spacious and comfortable but the location is the real star. The pictures do not do it justice! And Makisand his daughter were super attentive to all our needs with excellent communication. I can’t say enough good things about Villa Kokkini!
4690117,Joan July 2018 Kokkini Villa is truly a fantastic find and one of the best Airbnb places we have ever stayed in. Set high up on a hill away from passing traffic in a very peaceful location  it was the perfect setting for a family getaway. The villa has brilliant facilities; the pool is just wonderful - a great size and cleaned early every morning by the host’s father. The steep driveway is a challenge by car and by foot but you get used to it very quickly. The villa is cleaned and fresh towels provided every few days which was a bonus. Each of the bedrooms have plenty of storage space plus an outside balcony. Air con is available in every room and there are mosquito blinds on every window which was a godsend with the mosquitos. The kitchen was well-equipped which was good as we cooked quite a bit as it was just lovely to chill most days by the pool and have leisurely lunches and evening meals as and when it suited. The villa is well located - 15-20 mins from airport and Corfu town and 5 mins from Acqualand. The host Spiridoula provided lots of recommendations on restaurants and those that we went to were superb! Thanks Spiridoula! We would definitely return to Kokkini Villa. There were a couple of downsides - watch out for the army of ants downstairs in the kitchen drawers  floor and outside dining table plus the dishwasher didn’t clean dishes properly no matter what we tried but these were very minor irritations and did not stop us from having a wonderful time. Go to Villa Kokkini - you won’t regret it!! It is a gorgeous villa and we were sad to leave it! Show more
4690117,Barbara July 2018 My family and I have just returned from a week vacation in Corfu. We stayed at the beautiful Villa Kokkini. Villa Kokkini is located 20 minutes from the airport in the hills overlooking the Kokkini valley. It is close to the beautiful beaches of Ermones and Glyfada. The villa is exceptional! Not only is it beautiful but it is clean  functional and everything you need the villa has available for an enjoyable vacation. The owner Mr. Makis is a very kind man. He personally makes sure the pool is immaculately clean EVERY morning. Every 3 days they came by to clean the entire house. There were 8 of us but it suits up to 12 people. We cannot express how much fun we had pool side at Villa Kokkini and we totally reccomend it if you are thinking about vacationing in Corfu! Thank you Makis and your daughter for your hospitality. We will be back to visit you!
36199760,Martin September 2022 Comfortable house in a lovely location with an idyllic garden.
36199760,Elena August 2022 We had a pleasant holiday at this apartament  the location is perfect for a family with kids. We stayed at the apartment most of the days  because it is one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. The apartment is nice  but it needs a renovation  especiallly the bathroom! Anastasios and Evangelia are very friendly and they gave us very good tips!
36199760,Patrice August 2022 Very nice place. Perfect for a family. The location is ideal just a few meters from a swim. The beach is very well suited for little kids. I would certainly go back to this place.
36199760,Paweł June 2022 Nice place  perfect localization  very nice hosts!
36199760,Matthew April 2022 This place couldn’t be any closer to the beach unless it was on the sand itself. The location can’t be beat. The outdoor space is great and feels very private. The host was very welcoming and helpful. Definitely would stay again!
36199760,Daniel September 2021 Excellent time in this flat & Anastasios is taking good care of his guests with ecxellent recommendations
36199760,Khuong September 2021 Everything was as expected.  The location was fantastic and the space was enough for our 2 young boys. To be honest they spent most of the time in the garden or on the beach so inside space was not a priority for us.  The kitchen was very well stocked and there were even ice cubes already in the fridge.  There were plenty of beach towels. There were also lots of beach equipment for us to use such as body board  inflatables  nets  beach games.  We had a great time and will be back.
36199760,Stella August 2021 Location is very good but bathroom needs renovation and generally not well cleaned...and considering the rate per night i consider that it is NOT a value for money option.
36199760,Alexandra July 2021 Simply amazing. The location is perfect  basically AT the wonderful beach of Glyfada  the terrace is a dream and Anastasios is the most helpful host I've ever met. 5*****!!
36199760,Jan July 2021 We came for 11 days of our summer vacation to this appartment at Glyfada Beach. We had a great time. The garden  lawn and the location right next to the beach were perfect  espacially with kids. size of the appartment was sufficient for us with two kids. The kitchen was well equipped for basic cooking. We probably come back to that area of Corfu  we might consider an appartment second or third row or second floor though to save some money during Main season. Anyway  we had a perfect time!
36199760,Julia August 2020 Anastasios is a fantastic host!  From the checkin to the checkout we were taken care of  any question or request was addressed very fast  he provided local tips and made our stay absolutely fantastic. The place is amazing  you walk out to one of the best beaches on the island. It has everting you need for a great getaway.
36199760,Mike August 2020 Unbeatable location.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ With just a little investment updating the kitchen  it would be truly superb 😊
36199760,Borja August 2019 Great place right in first line of one of the best beaches in Greece. Very nice host also.
36199760,Greta August 2019 Beautiful location  directly on the beach with lovely grass yard for kids to play in. Paradise.
36199760,Claudiu September 2022 Very cool! Translated from Romanian  Show original
36199760,Eric August 2022 Beautiful location really close to the sea  it was beautiful days  waking up or dining with the sea at 10 mts is really fantastic. Excellent communication and easy check-in/out. The price is worth the place. We were sunbathing in the garden and then a short walk away you could bathe  the beach is always free enough and a quiet location far enough from the Pazuzu  a place where there is often music and party and you eat very well. The vote would be 4.5 because we had problems with small ants that we occasionally entered the kitchen and bathroom and the only note that can be improved is the bathroom that needs a refresh and does not have power outlets. They are things that still happen in front of the beauty of the location  really beautiful. There are two deck chairs in the garden  if you are more you can rent for €4 one in the place 30 meters from the house. Parking is also available at the beginning of the complex. Glyfada is a quiet beach mostly made of sand with some smooth rocks toward the shore  and then return to being a sandy bottom that descends slowly. When it's not windy  the sea is a table and the water is warm. There are two inexpensive markets and three restaurants/clubs including except Pazuzu. Those who come to Glyfada choose the sea and tranquility  and in the evening listen to the silence and noise of the sea  or take the car and go to Corfu Town in about 30/40 Min. Fall in love with the place. We'll be back Show more Translated from Italian  Show original
36199760,Clarisse August 2022 The location is absolutely amazing  the beach is sublime  the views are breathtaking  you can't get enough of it. The hosts are accommodating and adorable. A cot and high chair were set up for our son and beach towels were available. If you want to fall asleep and wake up with the sound of the sea every day  go for it! Translated from French  Show original
36199760,Tanja July 2022 We had a lot of fun at Anastasios and Evangelia's apartment. The place is fabulous and we were not disappointed at all with the photos: from the garden  you have direct access to the beach and the clear water of Glyfada. Evangelia was always very quick to respond and very kindly to our questions and gave us good copnseils. Being the apartment not rented directly after our departure  Anastasios and Evangelia allowed us to enjoy it again the last day  waiting for our evening flight. A very small downside in terms of value: to our taste  the bathroom needs to be renovated to get the 5th star. But for the rest  the place is well worth it! Translated from French  Show original
36199760,Linda July 2022 The location couldn't be better! All in all  everything is as pictured or described! Beautiful beach and beautiful island!! Translated from German  Show original

Only 20 minutes from the old town  with a breathtaking view 5 minutes drive to the throne of the Kaiser in Pélékas  a great restaurant a 2-minute walk away with very reasonable prices  what more could you say  an exceptional place. And impeccable receptionist service please ! Translated from French  Show original
36199760,Lissy September 2019 There were four of us with our two children in the cottage. The location is perfect  right on the sea. The beach is great. The garden is beautiful. The photos represent the cottage better than it is. That's a shame  because the expectations are higher. Translated from German  Show original
36199760,Nidal August 2019 Well-equipped apartment  the host to leave coffee  pasta oil  etc.  appreciated when arriving late. The place is located on a beach directly from sand  we don't get tired of the sea show at any time of the day we had a great stay Translated from French  Show original
46459414,Laura October 2022 The villa was beautiful with the most amazing views  perfect location- the instructions sent made it really easy to find even in a hire car with no idea about the area. Communication was spot on. They left a pool inflatable flamingo which my daughter absolutely LOVED (sorry that it didn’t last the week!!) but I thought this was a lovely touch. The pool was clean and spacious and was cleaned 3 times whilst we were there. I’m being really really picky here but the only very slight negative was the walk in shower upstairs was so powerful it flooded the bathroom floor one evening seeping out into the hallway which took ages to clean up/dry and behind the doors in the toilets were not as clean as the rest of the villa. Overall  a great stay in a perfect location  great value for money and would highly recommend! Thank you. Response from Sofronios November 2022 Dear Laura  Hello from Eos Villas.

46459414,Tom July 2022 The villas has fantastic views  and four comfortable rooms. Communication with our host was good  and any issues / queries were quickly answered.

46459414,Lars May 2022 The house is well maintained and the views are really amazing as the house is approx. 100m above sea level (facing towards Corfu town). It was clean  with a nice pool  complete kitchen. I would say this is ideal for up to for adults plus for kids. While this is all positive  there is one big downside: the location. The house is located between serpentines  so you have the noises of all traffic two times  before and behind your house. This is very noisy during the day as this road is the one and main connection from Corfu town to the North/East part of Corfu. In addition you have the entrance to the TUI Blue Hotel in front of the house  where young(er) guests stand during the night with a boombox and a drink  taking laughing and singing until 0200am or even later.

46459414,Laura May 2022 Fabulous villa! It really is as gorgeous as the pictures! We had an amazing stay and wouldn’t hesitate to go back! I would highly recommend hiring a car though as there are no shops within walking distance and although the beach is only a 15/20 minute walk it is uphill in heat with little shade. It was worth the location though for the beautiful views every day and the stunning pool meant we only wanted to go the beach a couple of days anyway. Response from Sofronios May 2022 Dear Laura.

There are now railings around the pool which weren’t included in the photos when booking
46459414,Mariel September 2021 The views of Villa Mare Assinia are unbelievable and we had several awe inspiring mornings and evenings looking over the Ionian sea. The villa was comfortable and well equipped. The villa is located in a very beautiful part of Corfu but does require either a car or some degree of fitness to get to the nearby beaches and tavernas as the villa is located on a hill. Its a small price to pay for the outstanding views. We visited Agni beach as well as Nissaki and these were two of our favourite beaches in Corfu. The management company  EOS  was very responsive to some minor issues and resolved them quickly. They were also very helpful with assisting to return an item left behind. I would recommend this villa. Response from Sofronios September 2021 Dear Mariel. I appreciate your positive feedback about our property and thanks very much for your time to review.

All was perfect and as described in the listing except for few minor stuff that are lacking but as the villa is brand new probably will be fixed soon - WiFi not accesible on 2nd floor  tv signal not present (we did not use and did no ask  pretty sure is a quick fix)  and hot water is easily exhausted when several people used at once.

28265800,Johanna November 2022 Danae and Athina are great hosts - they're very welcoming and replied within minutes to all our enquiries. The check-in and check-out process was super easy and accommodating to all our needs. p.E. my friends were able to check in earlier than me  even though i had made the booking (my flight arrived later that day). The house itself has everything you might want and more. Everything's clean  tidy and in a very good condition. The house is situated right next to the island's highway which is great if you need to go back and forth between the house and Corfu town or the house and Ipsos  as there is a bus stop right in front of the premises. However  we didn't really use the beautiful terrace due to the heavy traffic noise. Inside the house the traffic noise is much quieter and if you close the windows you can barely hear it at all. You can park your car right next to the premises. All in all it was a great stay  thanks for everything Danae and Athina!
28265800,Wendy October 2022 We had a wonderful stay at this villa! It is extremely well equipped and the owner has gone out of her way to think of every amenity for your comfort. We easily caught the bus into the old town and enjoyed lovely swims at the beach about 15 min walk away. Communication was great and an internet issue after an island-wide power outage was promptly resolved.
28265800,Suzy October 2022 This house was perfect for me and my 4 friends (all 40 y.o)  we came to celebrate my husband's birthday and were not disappointed! Easy check in (an early one was allowed for us) and a very warm and friendly welcome by Danae when we parked the car outside  we could not fault it's beauty or location. An easy 15 minute drive from the airport  great base to explore the island and a bus stop right outside if you don't fancy driving  we were happy with our choice. The sea view from the balcony is worth it! The house is spotless and is very well equipped with literally everything you could possibly need  we were all provided with fresh toiletries  towels  slippers and some welcomed basics such as coffee  bread and juice. There are beautiful touches all around the house to make you feel at home  beach towels and hats  board games and comfortable  social places to sit with your friends and family.  Yes there is a busy road outside but you don't really notice it and at night  we didn't hear it at all. It is a great road to join to get to Corfu Town or the other way up the island north and west so we found it convenient. There is a large supermarket  small mini markets and restaurants a very short drive or 10-15 min walk away. Danae gave us many wonderful suggestions for our visit and locally recommended restaurants which we made use of too. Please note  there are quite a few steps up to the house so please bear this in mind if you struggle to climb steps. All in all  a five star visit and we agreed we would all return in a heartbeat! Thank you so much! Show more
28265800,Stephanie October 2022 athina was such a sweet and helpful host — she even came by to help us out when we accidentally locked ourselves out : ) the view is amazing and the place itself is spotless! just down the road is the tv durrells’ house… and the bus stop is literally right in front of the house so it’s very easy (10-15 min ride) to get to corfu town! danae sent us lots of recommendations of where to go/eat which we found helpful too : ) thank you so much for a lovely stay! Response from Danae October 2022 Thank you dear Stephanie!!!!!!!!!!!
28265800,Linas September 2022 Great location with stunning views if you don't mind constant noise coming from main 4 lane road 20 meters away from the house.
28265800,Dimitrios September 2022 we had a wonderful time in a great house right on the beach. Everything was great  from cleanliness to location and communication. We can only recommend Danae's house. Response from Danae September 2022 Thank you!!!
28265800,Elli August 2022 an amazing house with a picturesque view!! great hostess! thank you Danae Response from Danae August 2022 Thank you  Eli!!!
28265800,Michel August 2022 The stay was exactly as we wanted it to be. the house was clean  the location was near Corfu center and at the same time away from the City noises. Ms. Danae is very kind and immediate in her helpful replies. Our experience in this house was just lovely. Response from Danae August 2022 Thank you Michel!
28265800,Jose August 2022 We had the most wonderful stay at Danae’s gorgeous house. Cosy  quaint immaculately clean and well stocked. It was a home away from home. Gorgeous views and a lovely terrace. We were a family of 6 and never felt cramped. Beds were very comfortable. Danae and Athina could not have been more helpful or accomodating. They helped so much with taxis and restaurant recommendations. They were utterly amazing. Just book it! You won’t be sorry. Response from Danae August 2022 Thank you  dear Jose!!!!!!!!!!! :)))))
28265800,Kristina July 2022 5/5- we spend a week there with 6 ppl. The house is beautiful and very well endowed. We found there everything we needed and with a rental car or the bus the location is very good accessible. Amazing view from the beautiful garden Response from Danae July 2022 Thank you Kristina!!
28265800,Perry July 2022 Amazing home! Located 5 mins outside of Corfu town  location is great for exploring the island. Danae met us when we checked in and was so kind to provide us some welcome snacks  water and breakfast items. Also  Danae and Athina were always available to answer any questions. The home has it all  from beach gear to amazing views of the Sea  Highly recommend this home with the great host!
28265800,Bruce July 2022 This is a beautiful and extremely well-equipped villa with a lovely lush garden and a fine view of the sea. Danae and Athina were very attentive and helpful hosts and always supplied information or replied to requests within half an hour. The air-conditioning was great  keeping us cool in the very hot weather. Guests should note that there are quite a few steps leading up to the villa (so not suitable for anyone with mobility problems) and the main road is rather busy. Apart from that there are no disadvantages that we could see and there is a nice beach with restaurant at Brouno's. Response from Danae July 2022 Thank you!!!!
28265800,Lena June 2022 Fantastic accomodation  everything you need is available in the house. The living room is spacious and perfect to relax and the kitchen ideal to cook together. Everything was clean  and Athina and Danae very friendly and helpful. Beautiful view of the sea and bus stop in front of the house. We definitely recommend 👌
28265800,Stefanie June 2022 What a wonderful place to stay when on Corfu. Great place to explore the island! The house is all inclusive and very clean and has a beautiful garden and sun terras. Danae is a lovely host and very welcoming. Highly recommend this house. Response from Danae June 2022 Thank you  Stefanie!!!!
28265800,Majella June 2022 We had a great week at Danae's house. It was amazing - and Danae is a wonderful host. Everything was as listed in the description. It's a very comfortable and extremely clean house. The house was remarkably cool even in 30 degree temperature with lots of outside areas to relax  in or out of the sun. The proximity to Corfu town (by bus) was a bonus. There are a lot of steps up to the house but the view from the balcony was worth the effort. Danae was extremely helpful and contactable - she arranged taxis from and to the airport. Thanks Danae for a great experience! Response from Danae June 2022 Thank you!!!!!
28265800,Robbie May 2022 I couldn't recommend Danae's place more! It was charming  private  well-stocked and had views for days! She thought of every single detail and had so many considerate touches that guaranteed you will have a great holiday! She had floaties  beach bad  sun hats  extra sunscreen  and so many other items which really allowed you to feel like a local! Thanks Danae  we'd definitely stay there again! Response from Danae June 2022 Thank you Robbie!!!!
28265800,Gintare May 2022 Highly recommended. Beautiful house and very good host 🏡❤️ Response from Danae June 2022 Thank you!!!!!
28265800,Monica May 2022 Where do I even begin. Danae met us outside with an umbrella for us because it was raining  which was so thoughtful. She gave us the tour of the house  showed us a map of corfu and provided us with complimentary items for breakfast and a bottle of wine. The Airbnb has literally everything we need: beach towels  sunblock  hats  blankets  face masks etc. The owner thought of everything!! This Airbnb is also GORGEOUS with the most amazing view of the sunrise. We slept amazingly each night. Don’t hesitate and book this place :-) Response from Danae May 2022 Thank you  Monica!!!!!!!!!!

28265800,Stephanie April 2022 We loved our stay at this home! The views are incredible and only a short drive from the airport and town.  Staying here made for a perfect midway point to explore the north and south of the island as well as a day trip over to Albania by ferry.  Athina was an incredible host! Very responsive  and provided us not only with some wine and essentials on arrival  but also a ton of fantastic recommendations for our stay in Corfu!  The listing is spacious  clean and comfortable with all the amenities you could need.  Truly a memorable experience and would highly recommend this property for your stay in Corfu!

28265800,Sean March 2022 This Airbnb is simply wonderful. It has been the much loved and clearly  happy family home for a Corfu family with a very respected ancestry. The interior is welcoming  homely and so very practical. The view is breathtaking. Then  it is within easy and accessible reach of Corfu's historic town and the beautiful beaches and coastline! The best Corfu has to offer. Response from Danae April 2022 Thank you so much  Sean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28265800,Shivani October 2021 A picturesque house indeed! Gorgeous views across the sea and it was immediately apparent how much love has gone into the place. It is a very welcoming space with pretty much everything you need  and a great base for exploring the town and the rest of the island. Athina was fantastic at communicating before and during the trip so we felt completely looked after from start to finish.  The only downside was something outside of the hosts’ control which was a dog barking through the night next door  so we didn’t get much rest but if you’re a heavy sleeper  you will be fine! When we alerted our hosts to the issue  they immediately apologised and took action so hopefully this will be resolved for future stays. Response from Danae October 2021 Thank you  Shivani for your feedback! We feel really sorry about the issue with the dog...We did everything we could. Next time everything will be perfect!!!!
28265800,Evelina October 2021 Danae&Athina are wonderful hosts! We enjoyed every minute of our stay at this cozy  authentic  magical place!!  Danae welcomed us late in the evening with a smile on her face  helped us find the place  and bring our stuff into the house. When she showed us the house  explained everything  and cheer us up with local wine  some snacks for the evening  and some food products for breakfasts!  It was super easy to communicate if we had any questions – we always get a kind and fast response.  The house was tidy and had everything we need for a stay: from beach towels to kitchen supplies such as salt  pepper  olive oil  or even baking paper  for homemade food.  Danae&Athina thank you for everything!! It was a pleasure. We strongly recommend this place for everyones stay at Corfu!!! Show more Response from Danae October 2021 Thank you  Evelina!!!!

Beautiful view  great location and the house has everything one would need to have a pleasant stay on the island. Danae was also very helpful  picking us up from the airport the minute we arrived. Telling us everything we needed to know about the island and where to explore. Even going as far as helping us get a rental car at a great price.

28265800,Mike August 2020 The house has amazing views and is very comfortable and is well situated for visiting the town and the rest of the island. The main road is quite a busy bypass and you do find you have to go the wrong way each time to go the way you want This said you get used to it. Danae is a wonderful host and provides all those nice touches tou appreciate such as wine in the fridge  water  bread sticks  cheese  breads  mosquito repellent etc  etc. Response from Danae August 2020 Thank you Mike!

28265800,Dana July 2020 The house is very beautifully decorated  spacious and has all the utensils and amenities you need for daily life. You have at your disposal a garden on different terrace levels. The best part of the house is the terrace overlooking the sea which benefits from the sun in the morning  while in the afternoon has an enjoyable shade. Danae is a wonderful and welcoming host who welcomed us with snacks  wine and occasionally brought us watermelon and ice cream. She is very communicative and promptly responds to requests. The house is located just outside Corfu town  in a residential area so a car is a must. If you are sensitive to noise  just below the house is a rather circulated street and the level of noise can be disturbing. Overall  we enjoyed very much living in this villa for 2 weeks and calling it “home”. Response from Danae July 2020 Thank you Dana!
28265800,Boaz March 2020 Great villa and great host
28265800,Tina October 2019 Our time in Corfu at Danae's home was perfect! Location was amazing with beautiful sea and mountain views. House had absolutely everything we could have possibly needed. The home is spotless  spacious and beautifully decorated (inside and out)!  Danae is a wonderful and kind host who was waiting when we arrived. She showed us around the home  had a bottle of wine and cheese platter ready for us and spent the time to share information about the island and things to do.  Athina was very helpful and communicative leading up to and during our stay. Providing recommendations and promptly responding to all of our inquires.  We loved our stay Corfu and are grateful that our accommodations were so wonderful!  Thank you so much Danae and Athina!
28265800,Tal October 2019 A beautiful appartment in a centreal place  very close to the old town but also close to the main road how can take you up to the magnificent north part of the island. It is important for me to mention that it is located adjacent to a noisy road  and due to this fact there is no suitable parking spot. We got a quick solution for everything we needed. Amazing landscape and and decorated apartment.
28265800,Amanda September 2019 This has been one of our favourite Airbnb's. We read reviews and couldn't wait to stay and it did not dissapoint. The house is beautiful  clean and spacious. The balcony is a great size and we ate out on it most days. Road a little noisy but this shouldn't put you off such a great house. Beds were super comfortable  aircon in every bedroom and there were even beach towels  water and coffee for us. Hosts super quick is responding and so friendly. They also allowed us to check out slightly later and moved things around. :) Number 7 bus takes 10 minutes and you are right in the city centre of Corfu. We really hope to come back! Thank you again x
28265800,Ishita September 2019 Great place to stay in Corfu. Loved the decor and the hospitality of the hosts including the bites and wine to greet us  beach towels and local tips! Response from Danae September 2019 Thank you you Ishita! Translated  Show original

28265800,Jess August 2019 We are a regular Airbnb travellers and would rate Danae's place as one of the nicest  best located  and real value. The place was very clean and had everything we needed to feel at home. Also close to a big supermarket which was handy  and few steps to dozens of local restaurants and cafes. The bus stop is conveniently located just outside the house which means you're only a bus ride away from the main towns and beautiful beaches. Danae was very helpful from the beginning and was available at all times whenever we had any questions. We would highly recommend this wonderful home away from home. Danae was a fantastic host and nothing was too much trouble.
28265800,Song Ie August 2019 When we first stumbled upon this house on AirBnB  it seemed almost too good to be true. But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. The place looks exactly like it does in the pictures  kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. On top of that  Diana and Athina were the most thoughtful  gracious host who made our trip to Corfu special and memorable. When we arrived at the airport  we had quite a few issues with a car rental and delayed luggages. Diana and Athina came all the way to help us with all the problems  drove twice back and forth to drop us off to the house (we were a group of 6 people). They were so warm  welcoming and provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. We truly felt at home  so thank you!  If you are considering to stay here  please don't hesitate. We would definitely love to come back here to stay when we visit Corfu again in the future. We can't recommend highly enough! Response from Danae August 2019 Thank you Song for your compliments!!!:) We hope to see you again in the future!:)
28265800,Arianna July 2019 The house is extremely clean and it has all you need in terms of cooking supplies  cleaning supplies! Danae is very kind and helpful and always ready to help. The house has an amazing table outside where it is possible to have breakfast  lunch and dinner with the view of the sea! We had a wonderful experience!
28265800,"Michael July 2019 Danae's place is one of the best Airbnb's we've stayed while in Europe. She was quick to respond to every email  text or phone call and offered endless tips to get around Corfu. She is very kind and caring  even offered our 7 yr old to help her water the plants outside and play with the neighbors' puppy.  The house is truly a ""home"" with small touches that doesn't make it feel cold  like other places we've stayed. She greeted us with wine  cheese and local cold cuts when we arrived as well.  The front balcony/porch is awesome with a direct view of the sea. We ended our nights there quite often with wine and apps.  Rooms are spacious and clean with closets individual AC's.  The kitchen is big with fridge  dishwasher and table. There is plenty of dishes and silverware. The house is on the ""main"" road and the supermarket is 3 minutes away which makes it easy to find.  Corfu town is less than 10 min away. We took taxis most days (that Danae would call for us) and there's parking on the property as well.  We accidentally forgot our bending bands in the safe and she found them for us and returned them safely. She literally saved our wedding! Show more Response from Danae July 2019 Thank you Michael!"
28265800,Katherine July 2019 Danae's place is located on the stunning Kontokali Bay. The place is very clean  has excellent air conditioning and is truly a home away from home. Her kindness and hospitality was wonderful. We loved it and I would stay again anytime.
28265800,Gunter July 2019 Lovely place  well situated!
28265800,Millen July 2019 I fall short of words to emphasise just how fantastic this apartment is! Both the garden and interiors are kept at the highest standards of cleanliness and the design is exquisite  making reference to Corfiot traditions. The space itself is generous  with a garden stretching out at the front of the house and veranda's at either side of the bedrooms.  Danae and Athina were excellent hosts  going above and beyond to answer all of our questions and sending copious amounts of recommendations which were very much welcomed. On arrival  small touches such as some wine  cheese and meats were laid out and Danae was there herself to introduce us to the local area and advise us on bus routes etc. Communication with our hosts was also excellent.  The perfect summer holiday! Response from Danae July 2019 Millen thank you so much for your compliments!!! It was our pleasure to host so kind and cute people like you!!!! Hope to see again in the future!!!:)
28265800,Ruth June 2019 There are not adequate words to describe how fantastic this house and our host were. We fell in love with Corfu and are still basking in the glow of 7 nights here! Danae and Athina went out of their way to be helpful and answer our questions. The house is beautifully appointed with all the amenities one could want. The beds are really comfortable and everywhere was spotlessly clean. The house is approached by a lot of steps up from the road  consequently the views out to sea are breathtaking. There is a bus stop at the gate to the house  and the sea is literally on the other side of the road! Buses are inexpensive and frequent  and from the house you can easily get to Corfu Town (15mins)  and many other points on the island. Tip: buy a day ticket from a machine for €5.50  or single tickets for €1.20 and save money on the price you pay on the bus. You can swim from the beach nearest the house  although getting to it is a little bit rocky. Better swimming is a 5 minute walk away around the bay. The waters are clear and shallow  and you can easily see many fish. If you have jelly shoes  bring them with you as the beaches can be quite stoney. Or you can buy them in the local shops. Is this property too good to be true I hear you ask? Almost. The only downside is the road which can be quite noisy. If you are wanting a quiet holiday tucked away somewhere  then this won't be the place for you. But if you don't mind a bit of noise it is well worth putting up with for the location  the spectacular views and proximity to local amenities. You really won't be disappointed! Show more
28265800,Ferenc June 2019 It's an authentic  spacious Greek house  which is very well equiped. You have easy access to the town Corfu and to various wonderful beaches with 10-30 minutes drive. Danae and Athena are very kind and ready to advise you when needed. Response from Danae June 2019 Thank you so much for your kind words! ;)
28265800,Stephanie April 2019 I cannot recommend this place enough - definitely my best AirBnb experience. Danae and Athina were incredible hosts. Danae greeted us in person to give us a tour of the house and the kitchen and living room were full of delicious local treats  including wine  cheese  olives  charcuterie  and chocolates. Athina always responded quickly to our messages and gave us numerous great suggestions on things to do! The house itself is bright  very nicely decorated  and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped and was well stocked with the basics and more (including waffles). The bedrooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms are clean  with showers that have very good water pressure. The only negative is that the house is on a major road  which is a shame as you can hear cars when you eat on the outdoor patio  but the views make up for it. Location is otherwise very good as you are relatively close to town and beaches (about 20 min away). Highly recommend this place  if I’m ever back in Corfu I’ll definitely be staying there! Response from Danae April 2019 ooo Stephanie thank you so much for all these compliments!!!!!! You are so kind and believe me it was our pleasure hosting you! Hope to see you again in the future! Have a nice summer! :)
28265800,Bryant January 2019 Danae was the best host I have had since joining Airbnb. The house was beautiful and located in an ideal part of the island- everything is at your fingertips. We look forward to returning in the future. Response from Danae January 2019 Thank you so much Bryant fro your compliments!!!!It was really our pleasure to host you!!! Hope to host you again in the future!!!

28265800,Ann-Sofie July 2022 Can really recommend this place to stay. Clean  fresh and good location. The hosts were quick in communication  smooth check-in and they were very welcoming. We rented a car during the week so it was easy to get around on the island.

28265800,Camille July 2022 We had a wonderful stay and are delighted with our choice   perfect location for exploring the island  parking space  warm and friendly welcome with a sharing of good addresses  lots of small touches like a hotel  lots of amenities available  splendid view  barbecue  comfortable bedding  very clean  recent equipment... in short everything was perfect!

28265800,Pio September 2021 Beautiful house  with panoramic views and the owner of the house is very helpful and nice . We had a great time  the house had all the necessary comforts.

28265800,Moshe June 2021 Excellent choice. Very charming and well cared for house  very clean  the service is very hearty  the kitchen is fully equipped with the complete house package is generous providing treats and basic food products. Very very much we had a great time. The house location is also excellent  right in front of the sea and very  very fun. Please take into consideration that you need to go up about 25 stairs up to the entrance of the house (inside a lovely garden) and this is not suitable for guests with walking and climbing stairs.

28265800,Pascale October 2019 Our stay went wonderfully well. The location is close to Kerkyra  the center. The house is very nice  nice decoration  cozy. It feels amazing. Beach plates and towels available. Danae is very responsive and gives plenty of tips for discovering the island. The only small downside  the main road in front of the house is very busy. But you quickly forget it  the noise is so charming inside. Translated from French  Show original
28265800,Margaux September 2019 Very nice welcome  house with a splendid view and as described. Close to everything  bus stop in front of the house. Very well equipped house. The only small problem : the noise from cars on the terrace. Translated from French  Show original
28265800,Denis June 2019 Facing the sea a beautiful  very comfortable and tastefully renovated family house overlooking a very pretty terraced garden. The only downside is the road along the sea which prevents you from fully enjoying the terrace. However  we had our breakfasts there. The rooms at the back of the house are very quiet. A pleasant pied-à-terre to sleep near Corfu old town and visit the north of the island. Dance does its best to make you happy and make your stay as pleasant as possible. Translated from French  Show original
28265800,Carlo May 2019 The house is fantastic  stylish  clean and with everything you need for a pleasant stay. It is in a good location  close to a somewhat busy street  but in the perfect area to reach corfu town and the main beaches. Attached to the house is a very nice and well-kept garden. Perfect reception... In short  highly recommended in all respects Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Danae May 2019 Thanks Carlo for your kind words!!!!:) It was a pleasure hosting you!
52157512,Stephen October 2022 We stayed for a week and enjoyed it very much. The house is beautiful  and the view is amazing. The house is well appointed and has pretty much everything you might need and there is an efficient grocery delivery service.  The village and beach are not far away  but the road is steep  so we occasionally ended up using the car  especially when carrying all the stuff you need for the day on the beacn. The Village is small  but has some nice restaurants and a few shops where you can have fun bargaining for clothes and leather goods etc.
52157512,Johanna A July 2022 The photo's of the property are a good representation - great view  sunsets  well maintained.
52157512,Anne May 2022 Amazing place! Beautiful view  amazing pool and very comfy bedrooms. Great communication during our stay. Would definitly recommend.

52157512,Guillaume August 2022 Exceptional site! This villa is built on one of the most beautiful bays on the island of Corfu. The views are stunning. The modern house is very comfortable and the terrace and pool are very well designed. Pedestrian access to the beach (sand) 12 minutes away. The village where you can find many small shops is very close but requires the car because the road is sloping. Effective owner support via messages. Private parking space and other is possible in front of the entrance. Translated from French  Show original
17564244,Heather September 2022 We stayed for 9 days at The Rainbow Apartments with Spiros and his mother Amelia and what a treat!! Hospitality excellent. The apartment was clean and well positioned for a daily dip in the sea  ideal for children and couples. Spiros is an excellent cook and we dined there every night  most highly recommend!
17564244,Tobias August 2022 We enjoyed our stay at Rainbow-Apartments very much! The room was cleaned regularly and well equipped. The view from the terrace was absolutely stunning! Spiros  his mother and brother were very friendly and welcoming. The home-cooked food they offered us was amazing! Everything worked out perfectly and as described!
17564244,Jess August 2022 I can’t say enough good things about my stay at Spiros’s place. It’s a bit of a dicey drive (but basically all of Corfu is haha) but the apartment is in a lovely area with ocean views  a garden  easy access to the beach  and a quick walk to a nearby convenience store for things like water  sunscreen  etc. I was alone so had more than enough space for myself. Also I absolutely loved Spiros’s cooking and the homemade wine – I opted to dine with them every opportunity that I could! If I can ever get back to Corfu  I’ll def be staying here again.
17564244,Suzanne July 2022 You simply cannot fault the accommodation at the rainbow apts. A warm welcome  spotlessly clean rooms and the greatest hospitality. I was lucky enough to eat several nights also and spiros and his mums cooking was stunning as were the views. The only downside for me travelling with a child under 2 was the access to the beach was tiring in the heat as it is quite a steep hill to it. If you are not lazy and enjoy the walk just bear in mind you can’t take a puchchair. The beach is beautiful and perfect for young children in terms of all sand and shallow. Not the usual happy  welcoming Greek tavernas or bars on the beach that I’m used to but this is because they are so busy and understaffed. If you are looking to explore and wish for a nice base this is absolutely perfect. You will need a car! Spiros and his mum are fantastic you will enjoy!
17564244,Matthew June 2022 We had a fantastic time staying here! The location was perfect - just a short walk down to one of the best beaches on Corfu - and the apartment had everything we needed. Spiros and his mother are great hosts  and were very attentive to any needs. The welcome meal on our first night was so good that we opted to have Spiros cook for us two more times! I highly recommend it! All in all  this was a wonderful stay -- we really hope to come back again!
17564244,Zuzana June 2022 The accomodation at Rainbow appartments by Spiros and his mom Amalia was the best choice we could made for our holiday in Corfu island. Apart from stunning view and clean and calm see for swimming (only 2min walk from the apartment)  we were delighted to eat delicious corfean dinners prepared by Spiros. Spiros and his mom are the best hosts and we really recommend staying at their place.
17564244,Imke April 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Spiros place. His mother Amalia made us feel at home every single day. Not only did she cook better then most chefs in the local restaurants  checked every day if we needed anything but also she organised a lot of toys and suitable furniture for our baby daughter  so she could play all around the place. She cared in a very warm and hospitable manner for all three us. I can’t remember having experienced such great hospitality! It’s a beautiful place for families but also just for couples I would say. Definitely recommended! Thanks to her we will always remember our holiday in Korfu!! Thank you so much and all the best for you. Hopefully we will comeback one day
17564244,Liam October 2021 Thank you Spiros & Amalia for kindly welcoming me and for the delicious food. I am sorry I was not able to spend more time at the restaurant as I was making plans with friends who were in Corfu at the same time and it was hard to organise. I would have stayed longer but wanted to see a new part of the island for the other half of my stay. The nearby beach is lovely and safe to swim with clear water. The wine  coffee and complimentary meal really made my stay  thank you again!
17564244,Mechthild January 2023 Very nice contact  we had the beach to ourselves  the apartment is a bit off the beaten track  but centrally located on the island. A good start to our hikes! Translated from German  Show original
17564244,Charlotte October 2022 we had a wonderful holiday thanks to Amalia's kindness  her smile  her attentions throughout the stay but also because of Spiros' delicious meals. The accommodation is very well located  close to a magnificent sandy beach. The accommodation is functional  we had all the meals made by Spiros  I would recommend it. You won't find any other restaurants as good. Thank you for everything Translated from French  Show original
17564244,Inès June 2022 we rented in June 2022. everything was perfect. a haven of peace. the hosts are so nice. The mom cooks a lot of typical Greek dishes (better than all the restaurants we've made) place is clean and cleaned every day Translated from French  Show original
17564244,Claudia June 2022 We have been contacted in advance of Spiros for collection. Very warmly welcomed on arrival. The bay is highly recommended and not crowded.

17564244,Brigitte September 2021 We felt very comfortable with Amalia and Spiros. Especially the warmth of Amalia and the regional cooking skills of Spiros remain a good memory to us.

43778858,Ruth October 2022 Amazing. perfect location. private beach and garden. house is clean with everything we needed.
43778858,Lydia September 2022 Absolute PARADISE for those who appreciate FABULOUS SUNSETS  immediate proximity to the sea  tranquility  nature  the sound of waves …. This small house gave us immense pleasure for 2 weeks  never getting enough of the beauty of breath taking views of the sunset  the moon  the sea  the garden … PURE PLEASURE ! Kamelia&George are very attentive and reactive to guests needs and are delightful hosts ! Special thanks to Christina the cleaning lady who does a fantastic job - the house is spotles !- and who by the way is an Excellent kite surfing instructor !! WE VERY STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS “BEAUTIFUL NEST”!
43778858,Shanshan August 2022 If we use only one sentence to describe George and Kamelia’s place  we would say that is a real paradise on the earth. It was really amazing to wake up with this panoramic sea view everyday. The garden is huge  your car is hided under the shadow of the tree during the canicule in August. The interior of the house is quite small  but very cosy. Modern and minimalist designed. I know It’s really a detail  but we would love to have the towels hooks in the bath room :) In any case  we just want to say thank you Kamelia and George for your hosting  we are very lucky to spend our holidays in your awesome place.
43778858,Alexandre August 2022 The place is just amazing. I would summarize it in : Calm  Simplicity and Beauty.
43778858,Eve August 2022 You just arrived in heaven ! The best apartment in the best spot we ever rented on Air bnb
43778858,Ambra Paola May 2022 It is a gorgeous place  the landscape is breathtaking and there is only a taverna in the nearest surroundings  so it’s perfect for relaxing and enjoying the sea and sun. The communication was friendly  easy and caring. We did not wanted to explore the island a lot because this place was so nice…
43778858,Asa October 2021 Came for the views  the private beach  and the charming house! Was not disappointed in the slightest with any of these things. Stunning. Awe-inspiring. Perfect!  Additionally  we were won over by George and their staff. They went above and beyond being accommodating - we had travel issues and arrived late but they were there to welcome us with a home-cooked meal (even following a natural disaster they'd just gone through). They continued to be helpful and kind throughout our stay. They were genuinely concerned for us and our welfare throughout our stay.  This is on the quieter side of the island and it's perfect if you're interested in getting off the beaten path  away from crowds/other tourists  and want to experience a bit more of the authentic Corfuit lifestyle.  If you like a little adventure  but still like to stay fairly comfortable - this is the place for you. Absolutely the best choice we could have made. THANK YOU!
43778858,Cornelia October 2021 The house is located in an undeniably scenic  secluded and peaceful location which entails some driving to reach the touristy spots of the island. It is fairly small  about 55 sqm in size  which was fine for a couple like us. The host was very welcoming and provided us with good instructions on how to find the house  a nice fruit bowl and a few items in the fridge. The house was very clean. However there are some issues that should not remain unmentioned. The kitchen is not particularly well equipped and lacks some of the most basic utensils  e.g. a can opener  a bowl for cereal or a sharp knife- the former was graciously bought after notifying the owner. This makes preparing a meal a bit of a challenge.Visually the kitchen is not appealing  as the fridge and stove are excessively rusty. The advertised toaster turned out to be an underpowered sandwich maker  which took 15 min to warm 2 slices of toast  so it was alas impossible to have breakfast together. During our stay we experienced a major rainstorm which revealed some constructional deficiencies of the house  as the water leaked in through several spots in the roof and through the insufficiently sealed windows and door. During this time  the water pressure reduced to a trickle  which made showering impossible. There are critters in the house at all times but especially during the deluge  so it is advised to bring bug spray. All in all  we had a pleasant stay  however for this price  expected more from the house. One cannot bank solely on a nice location - the amenities and the structure of the house ought to match. Show more Response from George October 2021 Dear Cornelia  We are very glad that in your total stay of 11 days you had a wonderful 9 days as you yourself informed us. Unfortunately for the last 2 days you were lucky enough to be on the island  in an unprecedented storm that passed and resulted in terrible damage throughout the island  in those days all the inhabitants of the island were experiencing power outages  water  etc. You were not alone and of course it was not up to us to solve such a thing!  Fortunately for you  when in nearby accommodation that was flooded and completely destroyed  visitors had to leave under bad conditions  you faced the problem with a basin and a towel in the window  of course it was not pleasant  but after the big storm I think that a few broken tiles was the least damage that could be done after all this and could happen to anyone! Precisely because we were sad with your upheaval you received a refund for the days of the storm  although of course we were not to blame for the weather .  for the rest we do not present in our registration anything more than what exactly it is! however the house will be renovated soon wanting to upgrade our services for the best possible experience of our many satisfied customers so far.  Best Regards ! Show more

43778858,Ilya September 2021 It’s perfect;)
43778858,Albert August 2021 It's a wonderful situation in front of the sea. You feel alone and it's really pleasant. Communication is easy with georges. We have appreciated this big garden which give you many places to have a good rest. The bathroom is small and simple  if ités something important for you you could be disapointed. Anyway  it was a real perfect time and I warmly recommend this villa if you enjoy sea and view !!!
43778858,Hanna July 2021 Wonderful calm sourrounding and view from the garden of the apartement over the ocean. Down the private steps you find kind of an private beach. The furniture and the equipment of the house is unfortuneately a little bit „outfashioned“ but suitable to a vacation where you spend most of the time outside. Communication with the hosts was good :)
43778858,Lisa-Marie July 2021 We loved our time at this beautiful location. The views are just breathtaking and the beach / water are beautiful. It’s very private and you can enjoy a quiet holiday. Be aware of the limited restaurant options nearby. You will need a rental car (and the way to the house is a bit bumpy). The house is very basic but well equipped. The family has a lot of plans with the house and updating will be done soon. We‘re curious how this place will change from time to time. The communication was easy and we got help when we needed it. Thank you!
43778858,Adam June 2021 We’ve spent a month during the start of the summer of 2021 and do not regret a second!  The position of the place is great. The house is small and not really fancy but very clean.  Communication with host was excellent and they really made sure that all our needs and questions are fulfilled and answered - really great people.  the taverna nearby (walking distance) became our second home during our stay :)  we are planning to go back soon
43778858,Mark May 2021 Best location during our stay on Corfu - you can see and hear the waves from anywhere on the property as it’s right next to the water. Amazing views at sunset  too!
43778858,Nigel October 2020 Many thanks for the opportunity to stay at your delightful cottage in such a fabulous location. The house itself and the garden are delightful. It was clean and we had pretty much everything that we needed. We especially appreciated the provision of a few groceries
43778858,Alexey October 2020 Fantastic place with fantastic view and experience. Our breakfasts and dinners in front of the sea are unforgettable. Bad luck for us  in the last week of September we met an Athlantic cyclone and the weather wasa bit stormy. Thus  the sea was not very comfortable for swimming  but some days we made short trips to the opposite side of the island  where the sea was quiet (other days we were swimming right here).  In general  our vacation was great and we enjoyed every day of our stay. As a minor thing  I can mention only the outdated furniture and infrastructure of the house. This is a really minor thing  because the garden  the view  the atmosphere of the place are amazing. As well as hospitality of George and Kamelia.   Response from George October 2020 Thanks for your comments  we will take them into consideration for the future  we know the shortcomings and we strive every year for a continuous improvement! nevertheless we are glad that you had a wonderful time on your vacation!

43778858,Anna September 2020 Overlooking a secluded beach  surrounded by olive trees  George’s place is great to enjoy the natural beauty of Corfu. We stayed with friends and enjoyed the constant sound of the waves.
43778858,Jared August 2020 Absolutely breathtaking beach view and location! We had Our most amazing 2 week beach holiday! The villa accommodated 4 of us perfectly well. The hosts Kamelia and George were superb  took care of us if we were their family. They mentioned that for each season there will be additional renovations done to the villa  still the current state worked for us really well. They brought toys for our toddler kids and whatever we needed  no request was ever too big. We requested Corfu homemade food (delicious!) (in line with our dietary requirements) to be cooked for us and they delivered it so we didn’t have to worry about lunch and dinner. The beach is perfect for children as it’s crystal clear  shallow  sandy. Next door is a small public beach with a restaurant and playground. We really felt like one of the locals. Basic necessities were 5-10min drive away. This is not your luxury villa however it is your Luxury Beach Location with warm  azure blue seawater that is priceless! Thank you so much for having us! We wish we were still there..
43778858,Derek August 2020 We LOVED our stay here. We stayed with our six year old - who had fun exploring the grounds finding lizards and cicada shells. The family is Incredibly hospitable - and had the fridge packed with sundries and a Corfoit dinner ready on our arrival! The private access to the sea is wonderful and we took advantage of the excellent snorkeling around the rocks and the shallow warm water. The seafood at the Taverna is great and the beach was lightly occupied. This is a rustic place and you've got one of the best views/sunsets on Corfu - but do know it is quite a haven for bugs. Lots of wasps and ants - making outdoor dining a quick affair. Bring bug spray and ant spray and you'll be set! The WC is austere as well  but we were mostly just rinsing of salt and sand anyway. The vista pics will be the envy of your friends :)
43778858,Jana August 2020 We really loved staying in this hidden piece of paradise. The house is very stylish  not so big but has everything you need. The private beach is wonderful benefit and views outstanding. Kamelia’s hospitality was very welcoming and she went an extra mile to make us feel welcomed. There is a restaurant conveniently just next to the beach  so you can enjoy the serenity of no neighbours with accessible meals on your hand.
43778858,Neringa August 2020 WE LOVED IT!!!  The place was amazing: First of all  you have an amazing nature around you. There is a huge private garden with olive trees and stairs straight to the beach. You can hear cicadas (or smth like that) during a day  an owl at night  and wawes all the time. You can enjoy snorkeling near the rocks and see sea life. On the left  you will find a public beach with a nice restaurant. On the right  there is a nice wild beach. Secondly  the house is lovely with comfortable beds  everything-you-need kitchen  and barbeque equipment. Moreover  the owners are very nice and friendly  the communication was fast and easy. They even welcomed us with some traditional Corfu lunch :) thank you again Camelia and George.  Overall  we believe this is one of the best places to stay in Corfu.
43778858,Aart July 2020 George and Kamelia rented out their family house for the first time. What an honour for us to have had our family vacation there. If you are looking for an authentic and peaceful Mediterranean holiday experience  you are at the right place. Set up on the small cliff at Prasoudi Beach  overlooking the beach towards the Taverne  this quiet and peaceful place has an amazing view! And a private entrance to the beach!!! It was so quiet  no sounds from other people  no barking dogs  only the wind through the trees and the waves of the Ionian Sea....... The hosts are lovely people and have gone to lengths to let us enjoy our holidays. They even bought Corfu style dinners cooked by a local woman to our house on request. One warning. Do not expect a luxurious house. Instead  be aware that you will be staying at a small house  with a small bathroom and 2 small bedrooms. The beds are also small  not suitable for very long people ;o) WiFi and TV present. We didn’t want to leave. We loved the house!

43778858,"Gwénaël August 2022 We had a great week at Georges's house (5 adults and almost adults!). It is literally hidden at the end of the road  in the middle of nature and on a cliffside on the sea. A haven of tranquility with 180° sea views and direct access to the beach. The terrace is the room of the house where we spent the most time. There's shade all day. We go in  we go out without making too much difference. Excellent for who wants a bed to sleep in  a kitchen to cook and live outdoors all day! Perhaps the beach is better for swimming than lounging. Take flippers  masks and snorkels to enjoy the warm  clear water and to go around the rocks nearby. There is no current but it is important to remain careful if there is wind and waves. We spent hours in the water looking and watching the fish. The taverna next door is very nice  not crowded and the sunset is also very nice. It's the only ""business""  for the rest  we enjoyed the small village 10 minutes' drive away. Enjoy your stay. Translated from French  Show original"
43778858,Isabelle July 2022 A dream location with exceptional sea views. The house is small but charming  and the exteriors very spacious and shady ... a great place for rest and swimming. You can enjoy direct access to a beautiful sandy beach (50 steps). The hosts are very welcoming and good service ... everything is perfect! Translated from French  Show original
43778858,Anna June 2022 The location of the house is just wonderful! From morning to evening you can look over the deep blue sea and the private beach access via a staircase directly on the beach. The house is small but totally adequate for a family with two young children. The bathroom and kitchen were newly renovated at our stay. The terrace offers a beautiful view over the sea  vineyards and trees provide pleasant shade and the side glazing protects from wind. The garden with its trees is also nicely shaded and offers plenty of space for romping and playing for children. The beach is in a quiet location.  Kamelia and George are very attentive hosts and also address the needs of families with small children. For our little ones we got an extra cot  high chair and a paddling pool for the terrace.  The nearest place and shopping facilities need a car. The access from the road to the house is a bit adventurous  but doable. A tavern can be reached on foot via the beach. If you are looking for peace and quiet and mainly want to swim and enjoy the sea  this is the place to be. Show more Translated from German  Show original
43778858,Severin October 2021 Beautiful waterfront location with wooded garden. The kitchen and bathroom amenities are a little out of date and tiny bathroom. Charming and caring hosts (evening meal prepared at home and available for free) very good communication and very flexible booking policy (free cancellation) which is much appreciated right now. Village 10/15 min drive to food and supermarket. Translated from French  Show original
43778858,Olivier July 2021 A unique site  sublime views  a Mediterranean garden directly on the sea and a -quasi - private beach at the foot of a dizzying staircase... happiness…. Translated from French  Show original
43778858,Pascal July 2021 The location  the view  the access to the beach are exceptional. Beautiful shaded terrace. The house is simple (the bathroom is tiny and a little old-fashioned) but it's summer and you're here to live outside. Charming taverna with good family cuisine across the beach. Translated from French  Show original
43778858,Matthias October 2020 We had a nice stay overall. The terrace  the garden and the private staircase to the beach make up the charm of this house. The view of the sea is simply fantastic and wonderful. You can also hear the sea rustle in the bedroom at night. Translated from German  Show original
43778858,Felicitas September 2020 A great place with wonderful sea views in the middle of the olive groves for a quiet and relaxing holiday. Everything fenced  therefore wonderfully usable even with small children. Slide  paddling pool  highchair and noise protection - all available for a relaxing holiday and plenty of space in the garden to romp around  while the adults can enjoy the sea view and sun:-). Super nice hosts who spoiled us with a delicious dinner and a filled fridge for breakfast. Washing machine and Wi-Fi available - on request there was even a small dishwasher. The house is not big  but great for a family summer. Directly from the house you can reach a small stand. There is a beautiful long sandy beach about 10 minutes away by car. A fantastic island with great spots. We are happy to think back on a wonderful vacation and hope to come back again. Translated from German  Show original
48255455,Marleen July 2022 We had such a great time in Nikos and Maria’s little house. It is simple but it really has all you need. The garden and view are gorgeous and our 3 5 year old son had a blast in the pool! There are two other apartments there but we barely saw anyone  so you have enough privacy. We didn’t rent a car or scooter and walked twice to the town nearby for groceries. It’s about 25 min walk that we really enjoyed. Thanks again for the great stay Nikos!
48255455,Maciej October 2021 The house is very nice it's located in quiet area. The house has everything we needed. The beach is 2 minutes away with delicious taverna overlooking the sea.Our host Nikos and his family were wonderful to us and made sure that we had everything we needed. Heaven for someone who loves cats.
48255455,Daniel October 2021 Our stay in Corfu was perfect. Small  but all included what you need and the right thing to enjoy the Isle. The beach was amazing and rly only 2min to walk. It was clean and the communication was perfect. You can experience greek tradition! With selfmade food and wine!  It was worth stay here for our Honeymoon.
48255455,Maren September 2021 We had a super nice time at the house. The beach is only 100meters away from the house and Nikos Family is very gentle  warmhearted and accommodating. Maria brought us their own wine and food almost every evening. Big recommendation for everybody whos looking for a quiet place with lovely people at the sea. Response from Νικολαος September 2021 Thanks a lot Maren I hope to see you the next year.All the best Nikos.
48255455,Manuel July 2021 Our time at Nikos' house was great! The swimming pool looks over the ocean and you are surrounded by banana and citrus trees - it felt like paradise! Nikos and his family were incredibly welcoming and kind  bringing fresh fruit and homemade wine for us to taste. Plus the house is super close to a beautiful beach that is not too crowded. A great stay and I can highly recommend the accommodation. Response from Νικολαος July 2021 We are glad that you had a nice time in our accommodation we will be happy to come back. The best Nikos
48255455,Aleksandra October 2022 Beautiful surroundings. The terrace offers views of the mountains and the sea  just a short walk away. If you're going to this place  you'll want to rent a car  especially during the off-season  since it's a few minutes away from town and there's a small selection of restaurants nearby. It's also important to keep in mind that there's a lot of humidity  which makes the clothes and bedding damp  too. Unfortunately  there was no way to bathe in the pool  and that's one of the main reasons we chose this listing. Maria greeted us with a warm welcome and shared homemade wine. Despite our poor English proficiency  we were able to work things out and everything went well! Translated from Polish  Show original

48255455,Franziska October 2022 We really enjoyed staying in Nico's apartment. The view of the sea in this quiet village was a real treat. We were very lovingly and hospitably looked after by Maria and Stafros and repeatedly pampered with delicacies from the garden and kitchen. The hearty cats brought a lot of life to eat and sit in the cozy garden. The apartment was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The kitchen is very simply furnished  but the surroundings offer a variety of fine taverns. A vehicle is an advantage if - like us - you want to explore this beautiful  green island. Thank you Nicos  for these unforgettable days in your apartment. Translated from German  Show original
48255455,Arnold Herwig September 2022 I can recommend it to anyone looking for peace and quiet. Rural area overlooking the sea. About the accommodation: A beautiful garden to feel good about also with pool  hammock  Sunbeds and seating. Everything was clean inside and everything was also available for cooking or eating. It is best to buy everything the day before (market 3 km away) but in general a great quiet vacation! thank you! Translated from German  Show original

Very hospitable and kind host Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Νικολαος August 2022 Thank you for your kind words. We look forward to seeing you again in the future. We wish you the best.
48255455,Zosia August 2022 Charming spot for an intimate getaway for couples and families with kids. Close to intimate beach  inexpensive and tasty restaurant right next to the beach. A gorgeous green garden in front of the front porch  and a garden area for quiet relaxation. Every day  a baker brings fresh bread. Having a car (or a scooter) is worth it if you're planning on exploring the island more. The bus service is good on the island  but there is a 3km walk to the bus  a mountain road  and the nearest grocery store. You can have a wonderful time staying there  walking to the sea and walking around. Translated from Polish  Show original
48255455,Alexander June 2022 A paradise garden! Absolutely recommended! The garden is very lovingly decorated and the small swimming pool is very wonderful. It's also nice to have a street vendor with fresh bread come by daily. The beach is 5 minutes away by foot. Maria and ‌ικολαοσ are very hospitable and were very helpful! Thank you!

48255455,Olivier July 2021 We were very warmly welcomed by Nikos and his family. Nikos was able to respond to our many requests .

48255455,Jean-Philippe July 2021 The location is simply beautiful  wooded garden with sea views. Beautiful beach a 3-minute walk away. Excellent family  perfect welcome  always ready to do service ( even whenit's about preparing sardines😁). Quiet place away from mass tourism. It's best to rent a car to visit the island. Beautiful small village 3 km away with supermarket   nice bars and starting point for a short hike to the monastery with magnificent views!! The baker honks every day around 10am to sell us a very good and inexpensive bread. The accommodation is not surprising  as in the photos  the mattresses are very comfortable. The air conditioning was broken but our super host responded very quickly by providing us with a fan. Feel free to book this rental if you are looking for calm  simplicity and authenticity .

1941815,Sarah September 2022 Villa Chloe was amazing and Elaine was such a lovely  helpful host. The villa had everything we needed and there is a bus stop at the top of the road which brings you into Corfu town. Elaine was so helpful and gave us so much info on transport and things to see and do. Would definitely stay again!
1941815,Aurélien August 2022 Thanks for your kindness  we had a lovely stay !
1941815,Ciaran July 2022 Stayed for 10 days at Villa Cloe. It is an excellent property  spacious inside and out. With three boys we made full use of the pool  basketball net and trampoline. Very relaxing and quiet place. It’s located approximately 10 min drive from Corfu town  so easily accessible by car. I would recommend this property to anyone and myself and family will be returning again to enjoy what Villa Chloe has to offer. Elaine and her husband George are excellent host and answered any questions we had
1941815,Chibuike April 2022 Very beautiful  spacious and wonderful villa. Perfect central location in a quiet village for exploration of Corfu. Corfu Town 10-15 minutes away and most beaches  attractions not more than 30-40 minutes drive. Elaine and George were wonderful hosts with suggestions for beaches  restaurants etc.
1941815,Leanne September 2021 The house is lovely  very rustic  had everything we needed and was spacious. Beds were comfy  kitchen had everything we needed  and using the pizza oven was very cool! The outside area was lovely and having our own swimming pool was a huge bonus. Elaine couldn’t have been more helpful she sorted a big taxi and responded very quickly to any questions or queries.
1941815,Raphael June 2021 Beyond having a wonderful house (the pool is great) in an ideal location (right in the center so EVERYTHING is very accessible)  Elaine and her husband were the kindest hosts! Throughout our trip they went above and beyond to ensure their home felt like ours too! Highly highly recommend!
1941815,Mark September 2020 Villa Chloe is an amazing place! The villa itself has everything you would need to have a great holiday  plus it is perfectly located for nights out in corfu old town - 15 min drive or 30 min bus from end of the road. Elaine and George were hugely accomodating  providing us with loads of food recommendations (which were amazing) and also great ideas to do during the day  like best beaches and places to hire a boat. Overall  would highly recommend!!
1941815,Melina September 2019 The house has been beyond our expectations! Clean  wonderfully decorated  large rooms and the garden is marvelous! We rent the villa for our pre wedding party and stay with our family. Everybody has been super excited with the house! Thank you very much Elaine for your hospitality and for making our days there so wonderful!
1941815,Caroline August 2019 Surrounded by beautiful countryside  although a short drive to Corfu town and nearby beaches  Villa Chloe was a relaxing  picturesque place to stay. Elaine was easy to communicate with and welcomed us at our check in. The pool was well maintained and the house was spacious and modern. Thank you Elaine for the great restaurant tips. I highly recommend this house for an enjoyable holiday.
1941815,Gabriela August 2019 We just came back for our vacation in Corfu; we were 10 ( 8 adults and 2 children)   staying at Chloe Villa and having really great hosts : Elaine and George  who even come to take us from the ferry terminal in Kerkyra and lead us to the villa. Their house is great  very spacious  not far from Corfu town and all the main attractions  yet very quite location and so suitable for a family. The villa is big  very nice living with big kitchen and all you may need in there  large terrace next to the pool. We had a barbecue one evening or ordering pizza and spend time outside. Elaine and George are such a nice couple  there always respond to our questions and give us many tips. One thing to know  the pool was cleaned daily and for the garden they had a automatic water system  so having your coffee in the morning at the terrace in the fresh air of the garden was great. There is AC in all the bedrooms and cool the rooms very quickly. Pelekas Beach or Glyfada Beach are very close and are so good for families.  Thanks Elaine and George for being so great! We loved your place and for sure will be back soon!  Gabriela Show more
1941815,Basilis July 2019 The house was quite large but without any organization. The owners sent us an email with codes for the entrance to the house. The cleanliness was at a very bad level. We immediately informed the owner with photographic material. The odor smell that was in some bedrooms was mainly from the air condition. Just overpriced for what it offers in an agricultural area without anything special.
1941815,Crivat July 2019 Xx
1941815,Angelos April 2019 The place was excellent. It is a good choice for relaxing times and also for traveling to beautiful places because it is in the center of Corfu  so everything was near (ofcourse by car). The pool and the house was clear  and the garden was in perfect condition. The barbeque was in a perfect place near to the kitchen and with a big table near to it.The kitchen is better than the photos and i think that all the places (rooms  kitchen  toilets etc) are better than the photos. We have the best memories of the house and ofcourse from Corfu.
1941815,Frederic August 2018 It was great holiday! Easy to go around.
1941815,Virginie July 2022 Elaine is a lovely host  very accommodating  she did everything to make our holiday go smoothly. We had a very good exchange before  during and after booking.

1941815,Stefania August 2016 My husband and I with our daughters and their partners stayed for 10 days at Villa Chloe...it was a perfect vacation. Elaine was punctual in all the communications prior to the stay. She drove us from the airport to the villa through an email she sent me a few days before. When we arrived in the fridge  we found fresh water and drinks. The villa is strategically located to be able to easily reach every corner of Corfu. We really enjoyed the evenings spent in the garden where there is a beautiful patio equipped with oven and barbecue. The pool is wonderful and in the space in front the guys had fun playing basketball since there is a nice basket!!Elaine arrived in Corfu and met us....she and her husband are really nice people.

We would be glad to welcoming you back in future for a memorable travel experience. Best regards  Marilena_Key account Assistant - Konnect Show more
11010746,Dan August 2022 The villa is a dream. Pool for kids and adults  barbecue  sun beds  an amazing patio terrace  bikes.  The furniture and kitchen utensils can be improved or renewed  the dishwasher is not washing well  so in the end you still end up washing the dishes by hand. For the price  you would expect some kitchen towels and garbage bags  but maybe the cleaning ladies just forgot to take those out of the storage room.  Communication was OK. The overall service  with a bit of extra attention can become perfect.  All in all  we had a great time in Villa Maxim and I would always come back with pleasure.
11010746,Hein June 2022 Fantastic villa close enough to beach  tavernas. Large family holiday  all amenities you need  tennis court and table tennis was used a lot! Resort level pool. And excellent apricots in the garden!
11010746,Marco June 2022 Great stay!
11010746,Andrea June 2022 Fantastic villa with fabulous pool and tennis courts! Very good for families and had lemon trees and strawberry plants. Lovely taverna within walking distance but do need a car for shopping etc. Small village ten mins away by car. Nice beach within walking distance. Overall a great holiday would have been 5* but one room air con not working so hopefully that will be fixed and would recommend asking for a welcome pack. Would love to visit again in the future as Nikos was very helpful and it is a beautiful villa with everything you could want!
11010746,Matthew August 2021 Had a fantastic stay. The villa and pool are well designed and the facilities are great. We really enjoyed the peaceful location and the friendly family restaurant just down the road. There are a great range of beaches nearby.
11010746,Chris October 2020 We had a glorious week at Villa Maxim in mid- to late October. The villa was just as lovely as it was depicted in the pictures & everything was clean & tidy. The bread man came everyday between 11.00 & 11.30am  signalling his arrival by tooting his horn  supplying us with fresh baked bread  croissants & bougatsa. The WiFi signal was good & we were blessed with excellent weather. Unfortunately  the nearby restaurants were all closed due to it being close to end of season (we were there 17th - 24th October) & there didn’t appear to be a supermarket close by. This should be considered when booking. I was also disappointed to find that we were supplied with only 1 toilet roll & 1 teabag  the remnants of some coffee in the bottom of a tin & some very hard sugar. The description also gave the impression that beach towels as well as shower towels would be provided. This was not the case. And there wasn’t even a tea towel in the kitchen. From friends that run air b & b properties  I know that little things like this don’t cost much but make all the difference to guests. Overall I would rate Villa Maxim 4 out of 5. The few extra touches for guests’ comfort  particularly on arrival  would go a long way: tea  coffee  sugar  bread & milk  as a bare minimum. Show more
11010746,Sandra October 2020 We had a great time at Villa Maxim. The house and garden are just like in the photos. It’s very kid-friendly :-) The location is perfect for a socially-distant holiday in Corfu (walk to the beach in 5 minutes... drive to local village in 5 minutes... drive to Corfu Town in about 40 minutes). Would happily recommend to stay here!
11010746,Thomas October 2019 A fantastic place with great infrastructure at a beautiful location. Perfect for families with children.
11010746,Dominique-Hélène August 2019 This is heaven for a family with children: AC inside  pool adapted to children  a garden with toys for them  tennis  ping-pong  no danger. A very nice and available host. The best!
11010746,Francys April 2019 A marvellous house with all the commodities that a house could have and more. We  a family of 9  stayed and were very comfortable as it is very spacious. My children loved the tennis court   the ping pong table and of course the pool! We recommend renting a car to look around the island. Overall  this was a great stay and I would recommend it.
11010746,Amy November 2018 So much for our three children to do  they were occupied all day long  they loved the pool  the tennis and basketball and the table tennis  we were relaxed as they were happy! Thanks Nikos  we had a great time X
11010746,Billie October 2018 You won’t be disappointed. The only thing I would suggest  is to hire a car. Apart from that you won’t want for anything else whilst you are there.
11010746,Tessa September 2018 Beautifull place  perfect for a relaxing holiday with (little) kids! We loved everything of the house. If you have the change  go tho this place!
11010746,David April 2018 To describe how thoughtful this villa is equipped is the fact  that u even have an inside and an outside WiFi  a sink next to the huge grill and many more little extras. We  a group of 8 young adults  really enjoyed our one week stay in Nikos Villa. Even though we had two big fellas with us and the mattresses are a little small  we like to see over this because we loved everything else. Nikos and Maxim are such nice hosts and inform and help you out with everything directly. Probably not our last stay in Villa Maxim.  Side fact: car definitely needed
11010746,Brandon July 2017 Excellent place to stay while visiting Corfu. Away from the crowds and busy beaches  but still very close to amenities. 15 minute walk to a nice sandy beach. The house was immaculate and the pool was clean and beautiful. Nikos went above and beyond in making our stay superb. Met us at the airport  and escorted us back to the villa. Nikos was great at recommending places to go and things to do while visiting Corfu  and responded to enquiries immediately. A highlight was the fresh vegetables from the neighbouring garden. I would definitely stay here again!
11010746,Stuart May 2017 Nikos is an attentive and friendly host  he picked us up at the airport and escorted us to the villa. The villa is beautiful  the pool  tennis court and BBQ were all in perfect condition and we used them every day! The rooms are spacious nicely furnished  the beds are a little firm but we all still slept comfortably. The kitchen was fully equipped with the essentials. The villa has fruit trees all over the garden which we used for breakfast! The villa is a 5-10 minute drive to the nearest shop which sold everything we need. Couldn't recommend the villa highly enough!
11010746,Belina April 2017 Ideally located within a short walk to the beach. Villa Maxim offers all the facilities for a great family getaway. Whether it is swimming  tennis or table tennis that takes your fancy  there is always something to do. The nearby village (Agios Matheos ) also offers a great alternative to cooking with several local restaurants offering simple yet beautifully cooked food. Many thanks to Nikos who met us at the airport and for whom nothing was too much trouble. We will be back!
11010746,Alexandru July 2016 Great house  very clean. The pool is amazing. Is like a mini resort. Nikos was a friendly Host. For sure we will come back in the future to his home. We recommend his house!
11010746,Catherine August 2022 We had a great week with the family at Villa Maxim. The exterior is beautiful  very well maintained (lawn mown and green  a real green rug) and equipped . The whole family enjoyed the pool (including the small pool for children)  deckchairs  BBQ  tennis court  terrace. The figs we were allowed to pick were excellent. The house is comfortable  the rooms are large and air-conditioned. We found a good bakery in Agios Matheus and some good food around  in Moraitika or Agios Matheus. And good tavernas around here. The large sandy beach of Halikounas  nearby  is beautiful  though windy. We also took the opportunity to visit the various beautiful sites on the island  as well as a cruise to Paxos and Antipaxos. In short  the whole family loved the stay in Corfu. Thanks again  Nikos  for hosting us. Translated from French  Show original

11010746,Jiska May 2019 We just had two fantastic weeks at Villa Maxim! Nikos is a very friendly helpful host  he takes care of everything very neatly. The house was very neatly clean and everything we needed with two small children (2 and 4 years) was present. The outdoor space is perfect. There are a lot of different places to sit  either in the sun or in the shade. In addition  there is plenty of playground  so the kids had a great time and we could relax. The shallow part in the swimming pool is very convenient  which is separated from the deep part by a gate. And then in the evening BBQ and enjoy lettuce  outings  fruits and olive oil from Maximus's garden... Highly recommended! Translated from Dutch  Show original
11010746,Birgit October 2018 We spent a week at Villa Maxim with 7 people (4 adults 3 children). The communication with Nikos and Max was straightforward and friendly. Nikos even picked us up from the airport and accompanied us to the house. The house is very nice and quietly located on the west coast on Lake Korission. Halikounas beach (one of the most beautiful in Corfu for us) and several restaurants (Spiros Family Taverna is recommended) are within walking distance.  The villa is well equipped  clean and in a very well maintained condition. The house has 4 bedrooms with 8 beds and 2 bathrooms. The furnishings with tables  chairs and kitchen equipment are ideally suited for 6 people with more people  you have to get creative if you want everyone to go to a table.  The garden with pool is very nicely laid out and is also very well maintained. There are seating groups  loungers and even a daybed everywhere. The tennis court is a bit small  you have to the back and to the side just under 1 meter to the fence. It's hard to get a match  but it's enough to hit a few balls.  Overall  the villa and Nikos as hosts are highly recommended. Show more Translated from German  Show original
11010746,Carla May 2018 Villa Maxim is truly a paradise. With the lovely spacious  clean and comfortable villa (with rain showers  hot tub  dishwasher  oven and mosquito nets everywhere) but above all with the beautiful garden. There is plenty of space to sit in the sun or in the shade  lie down  play  do sports and unwind. Our children of 3 and 5 have not been bored for a moment in the pool  in the playground  in the hammock or on the bicycles and if the children are on vacation  then we have that too! The fresh bread hanging on the gate every morning and the freshly picked and squeezed oranges just complete it. Nikos and Max are very thoughtful hosts who you can ask anything. Picking up the airport is pure luxury and gives so much peace and quiet! Close to the villa is a sandy beach and there are also some nice restaurants. We went to taverna Alonaki  highly recommended with beautiful views  a beautiful garden and a nice play area for the children. Actually  you just don't want anything else after staying at villa Maxim. Recommended with a golden edge! Translated from Dutch  Show original
11010746,Maud October 2017 What an amazing place! The Villa is (if possible) even more beautiful than in the photos. It is large but has so many nice seats on the estate  that you can easily find your own place in the orchard  by the stone BBQ or by the pool.  We were here with our (in-law)mother and 2 children (1 and 5). We were met on arrival by Nikos. He drove us in front of the villa  about 30/40 min through the mountains from the airport. What a service! The Villa is wonderful to relax during the day and enough for the kids to play with (toy cottage  tennis court  basketball  badminton  swimming pool and MUCH more)! We ourselves have also played a ball every day and evening (court is illuminated!)!  The villa is secluded  so a car is a must! Every day we made a nice trip by car along both coasts and through the interior. Corfu itself is beautiful and super nice to cross by car.  At the villa there is a large orange orchard where we picked oranges with the kids and with whom we could squeeze fresh juice every morning.  The villa is further clean inside  beautiful veranda where you can sit in the evening. Beds pleasant. For some maybe a little hard  but nothing you're not used to after a night's sleep. Super nice TV to watch Lkkr video or series. If you bring usb or hard disc with you  you can plug it into digikastje and view it via ‘e-book’! Totally top for a chill evening.  We have used the BBQ several times. Supermarket is a 15-minute drive away and has everything you need.  Showers are nice and downstairs even a small whirlpool  delicious bubbling after a day at the beach. Along the west coast beautiful sandy beaches. We liked it more than the pebble beaches on the east coast.  We were here in October 2017  end of summer season. You did notice that. Some restaurants were closed and beaches were quiet. But had wonderful weather and plenty to do on the island  Nikos and his father Maximus are incredibly hospitable and helpful. Swimming pool was cleaned on request and they hung fresh bread at the gate every morning:) Communication was quick and pleasant  nothing was too much. Really great hosts!!  All in all one of the nicest holiday experiences and certainly the most beautiful house we have ever stayed in. We are absolutely going to come back and we definitely recommend this spot to everyone!!! Show more Translated from Dutch  Show original
11010746,Juliette August 2017 A beautiful  new  very clean villa with a perfectly maintained garden. We were also able to enjoy the pool and tennis court  which was more pleasant. The villa is maintained twice a week. In terms of location  a little far for certain activities including Corfu City or Kavos but very beautiful squares are right next door. Recommended !!

50250206,Chad September 2022 This Airbnb was perfect. It felt just like home and we wished we could have stayed longer. It’s very clean and tidy with a great layout. The location was great as well. We rented a car and had no problem reaching all sides of the island from where we were staying. Our host was very helpful with local tips and suggestions. Would definitely recommend this property to anyone!
50250206,Jennie August 2022 Jade Villa has the most beautiful view of any property in Corfu! The stairs where slightly challenging with a baby and three grandparents and the drive up is very steep but the house is gorgeous and suuuuuuppper clean.  Dimitri was such a responsive and gracious host. He left so many wonderful treats for us. Definitely ask about a transfer from the port or the airport because it’s so much easier than finding a taxi to take you there. Loved our stay!!
50250206,Roman July 2022 The Villa is clean and absolutely stunning  so great in fact upon booking I thought it was fake. I can assure you it is 100% real and the best AurBnb ive ever booked. The view is stunning the house is upto modern standards and you are about 5 minutes away from the ipsos strip (by car or scooter)
50250206,Kristen July 2022 The villa has beautiful views. Lovely layout  perfect for a family. The kids enjoyed the pool and downstairs bedroom with a TV which streamed Netflix (they called it the “movie theater room”) where they could rest after a long day visiting sites all throughout this beautiful island!!! Host provided water  juice  coffee  tea  beer  fresh fruits upon arrival. Host also provided dinner recommendations (we loved Olivia even though more gourmet food and pricey- but a beautiful place nearby in Nisaki beach). Location was close to Barbati beach for close lovely beach access. (Also close to Ipsos beach but we found that too crowded and liked Barbati’s ambiance better). Also central location to visit different sites around the island. It is a 20-30 min drive into Old Town Corfu which we frequented for dinner and shopping. Some things to note: the 3rd bedroom is a loft and bathroom is downstairs in main area for that room. (The other 2 rooms have a bathroom in the rooms). Also there is a long dirt road (slightly rugged and hilly) to access it so need to be comfortable driving that terrain  but we had no problems with it and was worth having a villa with a beautiful view!
50250206,Jordan June 2022 Excellent place to stay with a great host
50250206,Suzanne June 2022 We loved the fact Greenstone was tucked away up a bumpy track  away from passers by. You can’t hear noise from the town  no passing traffic  very private just perfect! An infinity pool overlooking the bay and beyond which was lovely to come back to after visiting one of the many local beaches. You can walk to the beach in Ypsos which takes approximately 15/20 mins which we found easier in pumps not flip flops. Fabulous restaurants and bars all with very friendly staff. A wonderful peaceful  private holiday. Thanks Greenstone.
50250206,Jeff June 2022 Our family had an amazing stay. Villa is brand new and in perfect condition. Great design  pool and outdoor space. The view is incredible of village and ocean/bay below. Our host was super friendly and quickly answered all questions we had. If you visit Corfu  stay here! Only suggestion is to have a car with considerable ground clearance. The road to the villa can be rough if you are in a car with low ground clearance
50250206,Basin April 2022 Dimitri was a perfect host. The villa lived up to all our expectations- I didn’t want to leave!
50250206,Rob April 2022 Our host Dimitris was very communicative and arranged to meet is nearby to guide us to the Villa. This was very welcome as it may have been tricky to find otherwise  as the villa is tucked away and the road is a little tricky to navigate the first time  particularly as we were driving a larger 7 seater  but i am used to small lanes so got used to it quickly. It is worth noting that turning a larger vehicle is possible at the Villa  but a little tricky. The villa was absolutely wonderful  finished to a high standard with wide ranging views down the coast. Dimitris provided a useful short tour of the Villa and kindly provided some helpful essentials in the fridge which was a welcome touch. He also followed that up with some helpful restaurant recommendations  and made himself available for us to contact him should we have needed anything. Our family loved the villa  particularly the views and pool area. The beds were all comfortable and showers had plenty of hot water to cope with our party of six. There were plenty of outside seating and lounging areas to relax in  either together  or if we wanted some time to relax by ourselves. The villa was cleaned twice in the week of our stay by a very friendly lady and there were plenty of towels provided. In terms of location  Ypsos is a short 5 minute drive downhill and offers some good places to eat. The Old Town is about 20 minutes away  and the Villa is a good base for exploring the North of the island. I wouldn’t hesitate to return or recommend this Villa to others. Show more
50250206,Richard October 2021 The accommodation was great  very clean and the interior design and equipment are on high standard. The view is amazing. Everything was even better than on the pictures. You can enjoy the nature surrounding the villa but still reach everything you need by a walk of 10-15 minutes. Dimitris is a very pleasent host  the whole process was very convenient. We really enjoyed our stay at greenstone.
50250206,Jen & Frans October 2021 Consider yourself lucky for finding this place. A perfectly appointed  lovey laid out home in the hills overlooking Ipsos and Corfu town. I cannot say enough about the hospitality  guidance and communication with the host  Dimitri. He is a first class gentlemen. The house is situated in a terraced ancient olive grove with panoramic Ionian views. The beds were comfortable and all the modern conveniences were right there. We stayed a week and a house cleaning was included. We grilled some evenings and just enjoyed the outdoor space and privacy of the house. The car rental company  that was recommended  was also convenient & exceptionally service oriented. Dimitri stocks some treats in the fridge which made the following morning very relaxing  as we arrived late in the evening. Dimitri also supplied some unusual requests for us and printed travel documents as a courtesy when we asked him. This place is blessed and we cannot wait to return someday.
50250206,Alice October 2021 Book Greenstone immediately! It is absolutely stunning  even better than the photos. I feel very lucky that my family and I managed to get a spot during the first season that the property has been on AirBnB. It has the best views of the island  the architecture of the property is thoughtful and considered and the decor is really tasteful. It is only 25 mins from Corfu Town so perfectly located to for island exploration. We will be back!
50250206,Beth & Miles September 2021 Greenstone villa is AMAZING! It won’t be long before Dimitri gets Superhost-he was wonderful with communicating  directions  meeting us and leading us to villa and suggestions for restaurants! We absolutely LOVED the villa!!! Recommend a car for sure if you plan to explore at all! But just staying at the villa is heaven!
50250206,Francois August 2021 Dimitris is the most welcoming host   with groceries for breakfast  cheeses and fruits at arrival . The view is incredible on the Ipsos beach all the way to Kerkyra in the middle of olive trees.  The design of the house is smart . The furniture is very nice and « bespoke ». The house was finished this year but precisely finished.  Thank you again Dimitris.
50250206,Sonia August 2021 Villa Green Stone is definitely tailored for guests seeking high standards. Thanks to Dimitris’s unique sense of hospitality and kindness  thanks to refined aesthetics and discerning personal taste in every decoration’s details  holidays in this beautiful villa are just…blissful. Perfect bedding  bathrobes and sleepers  gorgeous bathrooms  fluffy towels  useful safe  smart kitchen  enjoyable pool  nice garden  brand new professional barbecue and panorama’s terraces…. gentle luxury is in every attentions.  The view on Ipsos bay is marvelous from sunrise until night. The villa is nested in olive groves: a perfect venue to enjoy a quiet privacy while at the same time being 5mn close to restaurants and small supermarkets in Ipsos. A car is needed if you stay in this villa but the path to go up to Greenstone is fully easy. We can not thank enough Dimitris for offering us such a welcoming atmosphere. From the very first smooth exchanges by mail  our host cared of everything in a 5 stars way: we mean it.
50250206,Natalie July 2021 Absolutely amazing villa. It is as gorgeous as in the pictures. Decorated in a gorgeous manner  perfect working air conditioning  amazing views from the living space. 5/5 stars for the villa itself.  10/5 stars for the host. He was incredible from booking to checkout. The villa is stocked with all the amenities you need  and more. We never ran out of anything including towels  trash bags  dishwash tablets.  We arrived to a cheese and charcuterie board  a fridge full of enough stuff that meant we didn't have to leave the villa for anything.  The host's communication was superb throughout  and we felt incredibly welcome throughout our stay.  I really wish all Airbnb hosts were like Dimitris - just the perfect host  who has made lots of tiny additions to the villa to show that every little convenience has been considered. There was even a wifi extender by the pool which was one of many small things that added up to the feeling that you're really staying in a place whose owner cares about your experience. Thank you so much. Show more
50250206,Mike July 2021 My wife and I have just return from Corfu and a one week stay at Greenstone villa. We were a little apprehensive booking as the villa is brand new and has had no previous reviews as reference. The villa was absolutely amazing if not even more beautiful then the pictures represent. We was greeted by the owner Dimitris on arrival who allowed us to check in early and spoiled us with a beautiful cheese platter as well as wine and a well stocked fridge. The villa is above Ipsos and the road is a little tricky to navigate the first time (I'm glad Dimitris arranged to meet us at the bottom of the road and lead us in) but we soon got used to it . We are both foodies and the local restaurants of Squirrel (Greek) and Marea (Italian) are both amazing as well as Michelin Star quality Eutrusco which challenges any fine dinning restaurants we have eaten at else way in the world. We found Ipsos beach front busy with younger people so we spent more time in the close areas of Barbati and Nissaki which are 5 mins drive away. We spent a lot of time in and around Agios Stefano's which is about 30 mins drive but very nice and with great boat hire where you can lunch at The White House. Corfu town is close by as well. (Salto another great restaurant with amazing Greek wine)!  We loved the villa  the real high points for us were the views and pool area  the stone work  aircon  the comfy new beds and the overall high standard of the finishing throughout. Dimitris was easy to contact if we needed anything and is so keen to make everyone enjoy the villa he has worked so hard to build. The villa was cleaned twice in the week and there was plenty of towels with spares downstairs. Everything about our stay was generous (Dimitris father pop by and dropped off two bottles of wine as well)! and far exceeded any 5* hotels we stayed in during our holiday in Corfu we had an amazing time!

50250206,Jacques September 2022 Dimitri   host note is exceptional as is his house! Exceptional view of the terrace  don't hesitate for a second to rent it  you will have an unforgettable stay! We rented it to 3 couples without any worries Translated from French  Show original
50250206,Brian September 2022 Greenstone is a gorgeous villa that we were very excited about. We especially appreciated the views  the stylish and modern decor of the villa  and the nice dining area outside on the terrace. The bathrooms were luxurious  the kitchen just perfect  and the couch in the living room very comfortable and inviting for cosiness. Two lovely bedrooms with great beds and a magnificent view. In the basement we enjoyed the washing machine and the cool environment for an afternoon nap with Netflix in the background  where there were Danish subtitles. There's a really nice outdoor area around the pool that we also really enjoyed.  Dimitris  the owner  has managed to create a villa with a special lovely atmosphere that we both think back on with yearning. The villa is truly one of a kind. Thanks a lot.  Dimitris is incredibly friendly and welcoming and speaks fluent English. Translated from Danish  Show original
50250206,Chris May 2022 We really enjoyed staying in your unique beautiful house the color and light concept couldn't be better...the house was like we would set up ours. Would love to buy new one at Villa Greenstone😍 Thanks for everything Translated from German  Show original
50250206,Martin May 2022 Perfect Hideaway  architecturally perfect in the last detail; simply a dream.  A 4x4 and a little driving practice would be good. Translated from German  Show original
650783701276819569,Julia October 2022 Natasha  thank you so much for the perfect holidays!!!The apartment is simply amazing - great location directly at the beach  perfectly equipped  very clean and as beautiful as in the pictures. Check-in and communication were very easy and the hosts are very warm welcoming and will help you with everything you might need. Thank you also for all the small amenities you left for me. Agios Gordios is a great location in autumn with only few tourists left but many restaurants still being open. I will definitely be back next Octobre - again thank you so much for everything!
650783701276819569,Louise September 2022 We had a beautiful stay at Artemesia. It is perfectly placed within a stones throw of the beach  cafes  bakery  supermarket and restaurant just as described. The team went the extra mile to welcome us when we arrived late due to our flight  with super nice touches made including fresh fruit  snacks and coffee. The team also helped us a great deal on the first morning of our stay when we contacted them for some assistance. The terrace is private and faces the garden and beautiful mountain on the other side of the valley. Thank you for having us and making us feel so welcome. We greatly appreciated your hospitality and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Artemesia.
650783701276819569,Alicia September 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Anastasia's Airbnb. It's a very lovely apartement with everything you need (including a garden :) ). The apartement is a two-minutes-walk away from the beach  as well as many bars  restaurants and supermarkets. Anastasia and Natasa are lovely hosts. I can highly reccomend! :)
650783701276819569,Tim August 2022 This was a wonderful apartment  in a great location. Agios Gordios is a relaxed beach town  but the main street with a number of restaurants and a couple of bars to keep you occupied.  There were also several nice touches in the apartment  including fresh coffee and bottles of water upon arrival.  There are also quite a few restaurants/bars along the beach where you can rent sunbeds and have drinks/food  etc.  Anastasia's apartment was exactly how it looked in the photos. It has been recently renovated  and only 50 yards to the water (if you don't feel like walking 5 minutes to the beaches in the town).  The apartment had everything you needed for a beach visit (including beach towels)  the wifi worked great (no problem for my work Zoom calls or Netflix  etc.)  and there was strong AC in the apartment.  I would definitely stay here again. Show more
650783701276819569,Silas August 2022 The host was very kind & the studio is very nice!
650783701276819569,Sara July 2022 Nice and cozy place to stay. Smaller than we expected but it had everything we needed. Very warm welcome and friendly people. Would recommend.
650783701276819569,Giorgio July 2022 Small but well-kept house  very clean and welcoming exactly as described. There is everything you need for a splendid stay. Very quiet and safe place just outside the small tourist village and a stone's throw from the sandy beach. Nice  precise and caring guests. Recommended if you want a quiet holiday and a good starting point for exploring the island.
650783701276819569,Didi July 2022 We spent amazing 4 days at the villa. The proximity to the beach was a great surprise because we didn’t expect we would be literally living so close near the sea. The whole area is fantastic and we had a really good stay. The place is very clean  the bed is super comfortable   we had some fruits as a welcome. The host was very punctual and helpful. We highly recommend it!
650783701276819569,Nikki July 2022 We had a perfect stay at the studio  the view from the outdoor living room was beautiful and we loved being able to get to the beach in 30 seconds! Agios Gordios has a great beach and incredible food - we went to Sebastian’s every day. Natasa was a lovely host and even picked us up from the bus stop in her car. If we go to Corfu again we will be back for sure!
650783701276819569,Daniel June 2022 We were privileged to be Natasa  Sotiris and Panagiotis’s first guests at their lovely apartment. Our hosts were some of the best we’ve had on Airbnb  extremely responsive  very helpful and friendly. They were on hand when we needed them but totally respected our privacy. The property itself was very comfortable for the two of us  we loved sitting out on the shaded terrace after a long day on the beach which is literally a 2 min walk! We didn’t cook at the property as there is a wide range of restaurants nearby  but the kitchen was well equipped if you wanted to cook your own meals. Agios Gordios is ideal to do all your shopping  has lively nightlife with lots of restaurants & bars and the beach is very pleasant. The property couldn’t be in a better location  It’s 25mins to Corfu town & the airport and around an hour to reach both the north or south. The only thing to watch out for was the road leading from the property to the main road which is extremely steep  you need to be a confident driver to get up the hill and watch out for other road users! Overall we had such a great stay and hope to come back to explore more of the island - we would recommend our lovey hosts and their apartment!
650783701276819569,Kai-Marcus July 2022 Very quiet  very cozy  very green. In two minutes on the beach. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Ana November 2022 I can only say : amazing!!! Everything: the host  the villa  the authentic village  olive grove field and wild beaches near buy! The villa is so comfy and gives you the vibe that you are at home  has everything you need so you don’t have to bother to buy or bring something with you :) go for it - no hesitations!!!! Thanks again Stamatis and Amalia ❤️
4491923,Alannah October 2022 A wonderful place to stay for a few nights in October. The nearby beach is absolutely gorgeous and the area is stunning. We loved the little village  an authentic haven away from the more touristy sides of the island and the Airbnb has everything you might need  including such a great package of welcome food  we barely needed to get anything from the shop! And the bed is super comfortable. Lovely all in all!
4491923,Susan October 2022 It was such a pleasure staying at Stamatis' cottage. We very much enjoyed our time in Liapades. The cottage spreads so much love and coziness. We had a wonderful stay despite the rain. It was lovely to snuggle inside or sit outside on the porch and watch the scenery. The cottage is very well equipped and is located in a very tranquil landscape. Liapades is a lovely village in the mountain with grocery stores  restaurants  a bakery etc. It is also easy to get to all the beautiful places on Corfu. However  it is essential to have a car or scooter. Stamatis is a wonderful host. He was always available for us. Communication was very easy. He also kindly provided us with food items for our first breakfast (we arrived very late) and was very helpful with our luggage when checking out. We were able to leave it with him for the day so that we could go on a day trip before flying back home.
4491923,Isabella October 2022 Just as beautiful as the photos. Very scenic and quiet area. Stamatis was a very communicative and helpful host  thank you Stamatis!
4491923,Manuel October 2022 Stamatis‘ Eco Cottage in Liapades has been an absolutely amazing place to stay. Communication was as easy as it could have been and we had the best beaches on Corfu right in front of our doorstep (for example  Rovinia Beach). The Eco Cottage is very clean and cozy  and Stamatis has been a kind and friendly host - he even provided some drinks and food in advance. Really good restaurants and bakeries are just around the corner as well. We can highly recommend this Airbnb! Thanks Stamatis :)
4491923,Amanda October 2022 Stamatis met us and showed us around the cottage on arrival. It was equipped with everything you could possibly need for a comfortable stay. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and the fridge had been thoughtfully stocked with a few provisions. If you want to experience authentic Corfu you will not be disappointed with this cottage and Liapades.
4491923,Christine September 2022 Such a superb stay at this cozy eco home. My husband and I were greeted late at night and directed to the home. What a gracious and welcoming host with such a cozy atmosphere inside. It was a great walking distance to everything and a spacious home. We are so grateful for the time we spent here and want to come back again!
4491923,Chris September 2022 loved the authentic nature of the property and its location away from main ourist area. Locals friendly but area very hilly and getting luggage to the property would be difficult if host had not assisted. Would have liked another bathroom as only one shared by two couples but difficult to see where it might be placed. Furnishings were good  equipment could not be faulted and beds very comfortable. Excellent value for money for what it offers
4491923,Alicia September 2022 We loved this bnb! Wish we could have stayed longer. Cute little town and the near by beach is beautiful. Stamatis was a wonderful host  very thoughtful and caring. Check in  and out was very easy  and Stamatis was very accommodating with our late night arrival. Couldn’t be more pleased with our stay!
4491923,Joanna August 2022 We loved this home from home cosy cottage. We didn’t hire a car but enjoyed the walks to the beaches and took the boat taxi to Paleokatriska bay. A day out in Corfu town was also very special  don’t miss the archeological museum and old fort. Stamatis is the perfect host  very kind and thoughtful with all attention to detail in the beautiful cottage. We spent lots of time relaxing on the verandah which has such beautiful views. Thanks  Stamatis .. it couldn’t have been better!
4491923,Ahlem August 2022 Everything was perfect in Liapades  the village is great and is next to very very beautiful beaches ( we loved Rovinia). The house is very clean and very cosy  all you need and more are provided. Stamatis didn’t Hesitate to help us and give us information and indication. We really loved staying at your place  thank you again
4491923,Stephen August 2022 A great stay  Stamatis was incredibly helpful  place was very clean and comfortable. Liapades is a village of two parts  the very touristy road down to the beach lined with tavernas  supermarkets and holiday apartments and then the local residential area on the hillside where the Eco Apartment is situated. Extremely friendly locals but be prepared for uphill walks.
4491923,Anthony July 2022 This is an incredibly beautiful property equipped to a very high standard in a friendly and authentic village community. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend both Stamatis as a brilliant host and his cottage as a fabulous place to stay. We managed without a car and enjoyed walking to the local beaches and got the bus easily into Corfu Town. The local restaurants and bars we tried were all great too.
4491923,Chris July 2022 Amazing cottage in a tranquil part of the village. Short walks to a few awesome beaches  restaurants  etc. Only 2 minutes walk to the town square which is traditional and welcoming. The cottage is an 11 out of 10. Wonderful workmanship and style from top to bottom. Lovely patio area with nice seating to enjoy the cooling breeze in the shade. Best outfitted kitchen I’ve ever had in an Airbnb. You could easily cook full  proper meals your entire time there as it has every appliance and all the plates  cutlery  etc. you’d need. Stamatis even had bread  juice  couple of beers  etc. when we arrived. Stamatis is a great host in every way!
4491923,Barney July 2022 A really lovely place to stay. Comfortable  welcoming and ideally positioned - in the village itself and away from the more resorty end of Liapades but within walking distance of the closest beaches and good tavernas. Stamatis was always on hand to help out or give us advice on where to go and what to do. The house is full of thoughtful touches  the terrace is lovely for a late-night drink  the aircon keeps inside cool  and all in all we found it a brilliant base for our holiday.
4491923,Andrew July 2022 Stamatis is a warm and welcoming host. He met us and guided us through the village to his cottage. The cottage was perfect - the perfect location and had everything we needed. Great beaches near by and in driving distance to great spot the North West of the island has to offer. Would highly recommend this stay. We will definitely be back.
4491923,Amita June 2022 Beautiful place to stay. Has all of the amenities. Gracious host. Be ready for a lot of walking to the beaches. House is not very accessible by car  but you can rent a scooter 😊.
4491923,George June 2022 Staying in Liapades village is the perfect way to experience real Greece. Highly recommend the Taverna on the square and the Bar Cafe for your morning coffee.  Cottage is lovely  it's quiet  private and has lovely views over the house tops down to the valley and the mountains beyond  this was a lovely surprise.  Comfy bed  there is everything you need for a relaxing stay.  It is a steep and fairly long walk to the beautiful beaches but not so far that you wouldn't go daily. We did  without hiring a car or moped.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or return one day.
4491923,Petra June 2022 The house is comfortable and lovingly furnished. We felt very comfortable and the small terrace with a view of the mountains was beautiful. The area and scenery is great for snorkeling and hiking. We would like to live in Stamatis house again. Thanks also for the tips about the area. Response from Stamatis June 2022 Thanks a lot Petra and Ralf for your kind words and for your nice review!!!
4491923,Olivia June 2022 This place is utterly flawless. Stimatis evidently takes a lot of time and care when preparing for his guests. This is the cleanest place I've stayed - better than hotels. The property is a 2 minute walk from the town centre  and very close to the local beaches  nestled in a quaint and quiet little village on the hillside  with beautiful views of the hills in the distance. If you want a taste of authentic Greek culture and a spotless  immaculate place to stay  with lovely personal touches and attention to detail  look no further. Thank you! Response from Stamatis June 2022 Thanks a lot Olivia for your kind words and for your nice review 😉!
4491923,Hananeh June 2022 A truly amazing host  they showed us the true meaning of hospitality. I truly recommend this place.
4491923,Nele June 2022 Nice house  friendly owner  cute little town with many restaurants - everything was perfect ☺️.
4491923,Devorah May 2022 This cottage is a treasure and was one of the best vacations we've had. Staying here was the best decision - it is so close to the most beautiful beaches  not far from the airport and Corfu Town  but feels so far away from the busy tourist areas. Stamatis is an excellent host  and the locals are wonderful. The cottage is spotlessly clean  and is absolutely beautiful- even better than the photos! It is full of so many thoughtful touches- food  water and great books! The beds were so comfortable and the decor amazing. We loved this place and can't wait to come back. Response from Stamatis June 2022 Thanks a lot Devorah for your nice review and for your kind words! Greetings from Liapades Corfu Greece!
4491923,Ronan May 2022 La perfection !!!
4491923,Nicole May 2022 Excellent accommodation in peaceful location  but only 2 minutes from the village square and with grocery stores and bakeries close by. The cottage contains everything needed for self-catering  and has 2 large bedrooms  an open-plan kitchen and sitting area plus a small but cute shower room. Outside is a courtyard with mountain views.  The path going past the cottage leads to local beaches. We did not have a car on our short (4 night) stay  but walked to the beaches  also south along the Corfu Trail through olive groves (beautiful with wild flowers in May) and to Duokades and the hills beyond.  We ate a couple of times at Marineris in the village square. Good home-cooked food with a friendly owner (and the best chips I've eaten in years!).  Stamatis kindly met us on our arrival in the village to show us the way to the cottage. He had stocked the fridge with plenty of bottled water as well as bread  butter  fruit juice  local ginger beer and biscuits. We did not see him again that but knew he was nearby to help if we had needed.  I would highly recommend a stay in this cottage. Show more
4491923,Rachel May 2022 Wonderful outdoor space and perfect location close to the town square  beaches  and activities.
4491923,Scott May 2022 My stay at Stanatis’s home was beyond wonderful - such a beautiful house in the most authentic Greek village  such a wonderful experience. Loved every moment of it and Stamatis and his whole family were such great hosts and took great care of us. Would highly recommend 👌🏻
4491923,Michelle April 2022 Stamatis's eco cottage property is absolutely wonderful. The attention to detail makes this property from a beautiful place to stay into a property that is also full of charm. Stamatis was extremely helpful when we first arrived in Liapedes and he provided us with a number of essential supplies which was particularly helpful. However  other than our first meeting  because the house is so well provisioned  and because he has organised our stay so well we did not need to trouble him further. I can thoroughly recommend Stamatis and his Cosy Eco Cottage to anyone who wants to visit Corfu.
4491923,Simmi April 2022 A Beautiful and well kept cottage!
4491923,Max April 2022 Great cottage  it is even better in person than in the pictures! Make sure you walk around the Liapades village. Location worked great for us  not too far from main destinations and very quiet. Stamatis met us and explained how everything worked. You will enjoy it.
4491923,Elyse November 2021 The cottage was comfortable and had everything we needed for our family of 4.
4491923,Sarah November 2021 A beautiful little cottage with everything in it that you could need. A lovely location in the village with lots of beautiful spots to explore locally. A perfect end to our holiday in Corfu. Would recommend highly to everyone! Thank you  Stamatis
4491923,Anna October 2021 We found this gem thanks to the great reviews on Airbnb. And we were not disappointed:-) Highly recommendable - for all the reasons already mentioned in the reviews.
4491923,Sarah September 2021 The cottage is even lovelier than it looks in the pictures: high ceilings so it actually feels pretty spacious. I had the best time: at the local beaches - Stamatis left helpful guidance - and doing various hikes with the useful cottage Guidebook. Day trip to Corfu Town on the Green bus - you don't need a car here. And the village is great - properly Greek  with a beautiful village square  and welcoming to all. I came on my own and felt happy and safe - particularly with Stamatis' lovely mum next door who brought eggs from her chickens one day but was never intrusive. I plan to be back.
4491923,Ilie September 2021 I could not recommend more Stamatis. He is such a lovely host  the house its even more wonderful than the pictures. The village is quite and all people are very welcoming. The location in between such lovely beaches its just perfect. We went for runs  hikes  sunsets in the middle of olive tree plantation... We are looking forward to go back soon.
4491923,Daniel August 2021 Great place in a nice  quiet village. Stamatis was incredibly helpful and even gave us a lift to our next stop. Definitely recommend.
4491923,Holta August 2021 We had one of the best Airbnb experiences here. The cottage was beautifully done and Stamatis was an amazing host. He had thought of all the little things and was always communicative and friendly. The house was spotless and in a brilliant location near Rovinia beach. Also I thought it was really well-priced for what was on offer so thank you very much Stamatis!
4491923,Charlotte August 2021 The cottage is a beautiful  clean and comfortable small property in the old town of Liapades. Stamatis and his family are very helpful and quick to offer help and advice. We really appreciated having a washing machine at the property  and the aircon was very good to have during our stay. The terrace with dining table and chairs was lovely to sit and enjoy the view of the hills and listen to the local life go by. Highly recommend hiring a car (a small car to access the roads nearby) to enable visits to the fabulous local beaches and places of interest. Great taverna on the square  within 2 mins walk - and a couple of very friendly little basic stores  where you can buy water  milk and other essentials. More taverna's/restaurants  larger stores  bike/car hire and ATM within a 10 minute walk. Highly recommend a visit!
4491923,Lucy August 2021 This is a beautiful home away from home  finished to perfection. Stamatis is an incredibly helpful host with lots of local knowledge and consideration for his guests. It’s right in town and there’s plenty of tavernas to choose from each night. The kitchen is also well equipped if you wanted to cook your own meals. We have nothing but nice things to say about this property and this area of Corfu. The beaches are perfect and quite close by  a number of them are walking distance from the house. Highly recommend a stay here.
4491923,Juliette July 2021 We spent very good time in Liapades and the beautiful island of Corfu! Stamatis is very friendly and we have appreciated the time spent at our arrival to explain and show everything. Its accomodation is tipical  authentic  pleasant  very well decorated and we have appreciated all the little attentions. If you want to feel far from home and take a trip back in time then don't hesitate!!
4491923,Julia July 2021 Stamatis’ village home was absolutely perfect for our 4 nights on corfu island. It’s located very close to many of the most beautiful beaches. Stamatis was extremely friendly and welcoming  the home was beautiful  super comfortable bed  and the shower was amazing! Plenty of hot water! Thank you  Stamatis  for your hospitality. We are so glad to have chosen your house for our stay in Liapades!
4491923,Adina July 2021 We picked Corfu because we found Stamatis place. I decided to visit Corfu just to get to stay in this perfect place. Even if the pictures are very beautiful  the place is way better and it just takes your breath away. You actually have to see this place to believe it’s real. We need to find out who designed the place  because you don’t see anything like this not even in the magazines. This is definitely the most beautiful house we ever stayed while on vacation. The colors are pastel and every single thing matches the overall decor. Kids slept upstairs  they pretended it was Mount Olympus. They had a picture perfect room. Everything was sparkling clean  and so so beautiful!!! There is a washer and dryer but we didn’t need to use- it’s nice to have it though. Stamatis is the perfect host- kind and welcomed us in his home like we would be his family. Took us to the beach a couple of time  as we ended up not renting a car from Corfu town. We enjoyed his hospitality and stories  and his recommendation  perfect communication- he also helped us book an early taxi to make it to the airport. Liapades is a cute town in Corfu  with access to beautiful beaches  very nice people and great restaurants. You can get fresh eggs and fruits and walk everywhere. We visited with young kids and we all had a wonderful time. We even rented a boat that took us around fantastic caves and unique beaches. You have access to everything from Stamati’s place  and then after a long day  you have this corner of paradise to rest. Our favorite thing to do was to eat fruits in the evening on the super pretty terrace. Overall: the most beautiful place we’ve seen in the Greek islands. It’s a perfect home in a wonderful vacation spot where you feel like you belong to a traditional Corfiot village. Stamatis is the kindest and most helpful host. Thank you!!! Everything was perfect!!!

4491923,Michael July 2021 Amazing home in a beautiful town in a quaint part of the island
4491923,Guido June 2021 This house is worth one word: perfect! Every little thing was perfect. The location: no other tourists around you but a cute local street. The best beaches of the island (Rovinia!) are very close  15 minutes of walking. People from other places on the island drive to this area to come and visit these special beaches. The house: cozy it is! The rooms are decorated lovely and everything you'll is there: a soft and good bed  airconditioning in both bedroom and livingroom  a good bathroom and a kitchen with all equipment you'll need to make a nice breakfast or diner. Stamatis: last but not least Stamatis is a very kind host who is just there whenever you need him. His mother lives next door and really cares about the pleasure of your stay.  The price is totally worth the house  and Corfu is beautiful. We visited Corfu for the 2nd time after 13 years and we totally loved it.  Whenever we want to come and visit Corfu again we will first check the availability of Stamatis his house!
4491923,Jenie June 2021 My friend and I loved Stamatis' charming stone home in a quiet traditional village. Restaurants are close and the beach -with see-to-the-bottom water- is also within walking distance. The locals are very friendly. The space is stylish with terra-cotta walls in some of the rooms and windows that let in fresh air. The beds are super comfy and the shower has great water pressure and plenty of solar-powered hot water. The earthy home is framed with bougainvillea flowers and red geraniums. Also quiet and stocked with grocery store items. If you drive  you will park a short walk from where you'll stay. But it's very restful being in this village far from tourist traffic.
4491923,Whitney May 2021 We absolutely loved our stay in Stamatis' beautiful home! The cottage was spotless and so comfortable  it was very thoughtfully renovated and offered everything we could want. We especially loved the private outdoor space  it was larger than we expected and very private while still feeling airy and open. We walked to the gorgeous beach every day  it was a bit more steep that we expected but the exercise was perfect. Thank you for a lovely stay!
4491923,Tomo February 2021 Lovely place! Great location to hike the west coast of Corfu!
4491923,Gina November 2020 Stamatis is an incredible host - very attentive and quick to respond to any questions. The house is beautifully renovated and thoughtfully stocked with enough for our first breakfast and coffees! So nice to be tucked away in the town of Liapades - very small and welcoming  feel like a real local. And the house is a quick 15 minute stroll from one of the most beautiful beaches. Will definitely be back!
4491923,Rebecca October 2020 This is a beautiful place. It was great staying in the village and then walking to the stunning beaches. My children made friends in the village and played for hours in the evening in the town square. Felt very at home. House itself is prefect and Stamatis is a very good host  was always quick to reply and helped organize transport and had lots of info on trips etc. Will definitely come back.
4491923,Jonas October 2020 We enjoyed our stay in Liapades at the cottage. The house is super cozy and clean and has all the details you wish for. Communication with Stamatis was also perfect. All in all we highly recommend the place.
4491923,Eva October 2020 The pictures don't do justice to this incredible place that feels instantly like your home. It's so cosy and full of little details that add the magic factor. The village is adorable and the cottage very close the best beaches of the area and island (to our taste!). We had a fantastic time and would love to go back!
4491923,Natalia October 2020 Stamatis's place is a real treasure! Beautiful interiors  sparkling clean rooms with fully equipped kitchen! We couldn't ask for more. We definitely recommend this lovely house to everyone coming to Corfu.
4491923,Jazzy September 2020 This is a gem of a place - so nicely done  beautiful stone walls  a joy to stay in! There is a great little outside area you can have breakfast in  and all mod cons in the kitchen. Highly recommended!
4491923,Christine September 2020 We really felt at home. Stamatis and his mother are very warm hosts. The place is very well equipped  the beds are fabulous and we loved hanging out at the local square near by. It is surprisingly quiet and has plenty of hooks drawers etc. to hang and store your stuff. There is only the smallest of criticism. Although the Tassimo coffee tastes good  the capsules are an unnecessary waste and not very eco. Apart from that we can really highly recommend the place.
4491923,Elisabeth September 2020 We had a wonderful time at this cosy Corfiot home  and only wished that we booked for longer. Stamatis greeted us on arrival in Liapades and provided great recommendations for beaches and restaurants. The apartment is beautifully renovated — pairing its authentic old stone charm and high ceilings  with a modern kitchen  bathroom and other amenities. We ate breakfast every morning on our private  shaded patio with a view of the mountains. Absolutely one of our best Airbnb experiences!!
4491923,Jack August 2020 Wow! What an amazing time. Stamatis is as good as any host on AirBnB. Liapades is a beautiful village and definitely worth visiting. Rovinia Beach is within walking distance and stunning. Highly recommend you visit this beautiful spot in Corfu.
4491923,Claire August 2020 If you want a truly authentic greek experience this is the place! A beautiful traditional home in the small back streets complete with mountain views  we absolutely loved our stay here.  The nearby shop and taverna are like stepping back in time with very friendly locals happy to help. There are also a few excellent beaches within walking distance  about 15-20 minutes away. Although quite hilly  it is partly shaded by ancient olive groves and the views are amazing.  Stamatis was super helpful and very responsive to messages and the cottage was exceptionally clean. We would totally recommend this accommodation and we'd love to go back  thank you Stamatis for a wonderful adventure :)
4491923,James August 2020 The apartment is beautifully decorated and has everything you need. The surrounding beaches are great and within walking distance. It's a nice spot to explore the NW of Corfu and quick to get to from the airport. Stamatis was very helpful  nice and quick to respond. We would love to come back again!
4491923,Claudia-Maria July 2020 We had a wonderful time in Stamatis cottage. Stamatis is a very kind and thoughtful host. When we arrived he brought us food for breakfast. The cottage is a very pretty  clean and well-equipped home. If you’re looking for an authentic Korfu experience  the Cosy eco cottage is completely the right choice. We will definitely come back!
4491923,Laura January 2020 We visited Stamatis' beautiful home in January during a chilly stretch of days. Yet Stamatis did everything possible to make us warm and comfortable  including helping us keep a fire going. We really enjoyed having this lovely home as a home base to explore to the island. He is an incredibly generous host!
4491923,Martin October 2019 Superb characterful house in friendly village. The restaurant in the square 3 minutes walk away was somewhere I could have eaten nightly. Stamatis is attentive and responsive but not intrusive. The woods and bays around the house are like nature reserves    saw about 20 species of fish . Cafe by bus stop run by man who seems to have the secret of human happiness  a condition which you will get closer to after staying here.
4491923,Anne-Wil October 2019 Stamatis' cottage is carefully designed and furnished  you'll feel at home in a second. Stamatis came to welcome us and helped us to get to the house. Parking is a few hundred metres away  but we really enjoyed our walks through the town  meeting the town cats and dogs on the way. Liapades is not full of tourism  a plus for us  but does have all the necessary facilities (supermarket  bakery  restaurants). Beautiful beaches nearby!
4491923,Daniel September 2019 Stamatis is an excellent host  the place is very nice and there are loads of spots within a short distance. If you stay here  you're in the heart of a cozy Greek village.
4491923,Sophie August 2019 We had a great vacation at this beautiful house. The host is very friendly and helpful. I can deeply recommend visiting this place.
4491923,Elizabeth August 2019 Stamatis’s place is an absolute treasure  nestled in a tiny village where you feel as if you are having a taste of real Greece. Old ladies on doorsteps wishing you “Good Health” and men talking outside cafes on the square. The cottage is immaculate  well equipped and a joy to be in. The terrace outside is lovely for breakfast and an evening drink. Stamatis couldn’t do enough for us and his Mum next door was very welcoming and smiley- dropping off eggs and a beach umbrella when we requested one. We didn’t hire a car- taxi from airport was 40 euros and glad we didn’t as streets are too narrow for tourists. We walked 2 miles to a lovely beach at Limni and less to Rovinia with two children who didn’t moan that much  especially when in the shade of gorgeous olive groves. If you book here you won’t regret it  especially if you like a quieter  authentic taste of Corfu.
4491923,Susanne August 2019 The little cottage is a beautiful home to everyone who likes the little details that make living comfortable. You enter the house and feel at home immediately. This is on the one hand due to the lovely atmosphere of the house and in the other hand because of the welcoming friendliness and attentive care of Stamatis and his mother who lives in the house nextdoor.  You can reach Stamatis everytime  he is very quick in responding and always ready to help. He offered us a far greater service than we had expected (e.g changing the bed linen and renewing towels in a short frequency  cleaning the house during our stay etc.)  And one absolutely great part of the holiday experience at Stamatis' house is it's location near the center of the small village. The center is tiny  surrounded by charming taverns and you can observe all the locals observing the tourists. We got to know the locals as very open and friendly.
4491923,Qristina July 2019 Were to begin. Everything was Way better than we expected. First of all The place is far more beautiful in life then on the pictures.Stamatis was beyond helpful and friendly. He came to pick us up at the airport  showed us the best places we could eat and even drove us to a store that was 12 km away from our home. Everyone in the neighborhood was very friendly and sweet. The place is safe for children as well. I traveled with my year and a half-year-old daughter and was more than pleased with everything.stomach this is mother who leaves nearby was so very friendly and sweet. She didn’t speak English but honestly it was not needed because she got across everything she needed to say and understood everything we told her as well. There was a lot of hand gestures involved but that was pleasant in its own way. the piece of advice is to rent a car. Because honestly when you go on a vacation it’s far more convenient to drive around then walk to each and every location. all in all we are more than grateful to Stamatis for everything he did for us. Thanks again.
4491923,Lucy July 2019 Great Airbnb  really nice beaches near by  great host
4491923,Róisín July 2019 The Eco Cosy cottage is just the loveliest place to stay in Liapades village. Stamatis was so helpful by collecting us at different times from the airport. The house is well equipped with everything making us feel very much at home. It is spotlessly clean and the decor is beautiful. We loved sitting in the yard outside to eat and relax with a view of the hills and the scent of jasmine. We drove to many places in Corfu but none were as quaint and authentic as Liapades. We loved being amongst locals who like to sit out on their steps and greet you passing by. The house is a few mins walk to the village square where we loved to eat at Marineras Cafe because the food there was so good! After we ate we liked to wander the narrow streets at night which is highly recommended and so safe!!I recommend renting a very small car to allow you to navigate the narrow roads and for ease of parking too.  There’s corner shops a two min walk. Two bakery’s. A cafe and a bar. Also a public pool with stunning views down the road.  We just loved it here and can’t wait to plan our next holiday back!  Thank you Stamatis Show more
4491923,Zach July 2019 If you are looking for a truly authentic Corfu village stay  look no further. Stamatis's place is one of a kind and we had an incredible five days. The local village residents were so friendly to our two young girls and all the pools around the area welcomed us for a swim. You can walk to two different beaches from Stamatis's place which take about 15 minutes. We liked Rovinia beach which was less crowded than the others and has stunning views. Its a little steep on the way back  but we enjoyed the exercise and slow stroll among the olive groves. All the food in town is great but we fell in love with Marineris (Kabob shop) in the city square. The food is incredible but the local vibe is even better. You can imagine what it was like to live in a simpler time  where everyone in a community knows each other and enjoys a good conversation. There are some places that stick with you when you travel  and we will never forget the experience we had in Liapades. I hope we get to visit again sometime soon!
4491923,Sebastian June 2019 Great place  in a wonderful location. It was perfect for us. We particularly enjoyed being able to walk down through the nearby ancient olive groves to gorgeous beaches. Stamatis was very helpful and kind.
4491923,Anne-Claude June 2019 Stamatis is a very kind and thoughtful host. He even took time to show us around Liapades. His cottage is beautiful and cozy. It was lovely to lounge on its terrace after an afternoon at the beach (try finding the gorgeous and secluded Klimatia). Many thanks for the sweet memories  Stamatis! I'm truly grateful.
4491923,Sarah June 2019 The place is absolutely wonderful. Spotlessly clean. Stamatis was a wonderful host  he picked us up for the airport when we arrived which saved us 45 euro on a taxi. He showed us all around town and the cottage. He had a bottle of wine  local juices  fruit  bread and bottled water waiting for us at the house. He even lent us a stroller for our 4 year old to walk to the beach. Over the top amazing host. The town is very cute and the restaurant nearest the cottage is delicious for local Greek food. It was a bit of a long walk with kids to the beaches so we rented atvs which was really fun and got us around town easily. We rented a boat on our second day and went to paradise beach which was the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. Overall it was an incredible trip for our family and I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
4491923,Patricia June 2019 The cottage was beautiful and just as described. The village is the perfect mixture of being traditional and welcoming to visitors. We did some lovely walks through the olive groves and in the hills as well as enjoying the local beaches. Stamatis and his mother couldn’t have been better hosts.
4491923,Joanna May 2019 Stamatis was a fantastic host who went as far as picking us up from Corfu town and taking us to his home in Liapades. He was very quick to respond to messages and also provided us with a tip of local cuisines  beaches and attraction. The location was stunning with a lovely atmosphere. It would have been easier to have a vehicle to get around as we found out later  but we had the opportunity to do some amazing hikes! Lot a of local  stunning beaches in the area that is in walking distance. The house was marvelous. We enjoyed making our own food and sitting in the front patio eating and drinking wine every evening. The locals are also friendly and helpful and Stamatis mother you lives next door was very kind and was able to help us out when needed. Highly recommended anyone who would like to retreat to a quiet oasis to come here !!
4491923,Anna May 2019 The cottage was perfectly located  in the heart of the village and within walking distances of multiple beaches. I went with my sister for some downtime and that is exactly what we got! We enjoyed breakfast outside overlooking the beautiful hills and blue skies and would wander to the local beaches later on. There were a couple of supermarkets and restaurants nearby (the majority also open on local bank holidays) so we had a choice of eating at home or out. There is also a green bus that can take you to Corfu town if you like for a day trip which was handy for us as we didn’t have a car. Stamatis is a brilliant host. He picked us up from Corfu town port and had wine and some food for our arrival. He also provided us with a map of the area and tips for where to go which was very useful! Thank you Stamatis for a brilliant stay!
4491923,Tierney April 2019 Stamatis’s place was everything we could have asked for and more! The photos really don’t do it justice. Stamatis picked us up from the airport in the evening and let us into the cottage  showing us around and making sure we knew everything we needed to  he also ordered us a taxi back to the airport on our last day! He gave recommendations and tips and answered every question we had really quickly! His mother who lives next door was so lovely and came to change our sheets half way through the week which was totally unexpected and a lovely touch. In April Liapades is very quiet (some restaurants and bars were closed) which was a shame but the bus into Corfu town was inexpensive and easy. All in all an amazing place to stay  thank you Stamatis!
4491923,Rachel April 2019 Even better than the photos  lovely authentic village
4491923,Richard October 2018 What a lovely relaxing place! Beautifully restored and full of nice touches. Honestly one of the best equipped cottages we've stayed in for a long while. We spent a week staying in Liapades and walked everywhere (apart from one day when we caught the bus into Corfu and browsed the shops in the old town). The local beaches were a delight and we snorkelled in the crystal clear waters as much as we could amongst the brightly coloured fish. One day we rented a boat from the beach and cruised along the coast. Stamatis could not have been more helpful or accommodating. He picked us up from the airport and arranged a taxi back. He also provided milk  bread  juice tea and coffee when we arrived and his mother (who lives next door) brought us fresh eggs from her hens! If you are looking for a really authentic Corfu experience this is for you. Thank you Stamatis for a wonderful week on a beautiful island.
4491923,Lauren October 2018 Amazing host! Amazing house. Above and beyond! Thank you!
4491923,Danny October 2018 Stamatis and Anastasia are great hosts! They made our first visit to Greece a memorable one. We chose this place  in part  based on the location and charm shown by the photos of the cottage. The photos are accurate  but do not do the cottage justice. This cottage has an abundance of charm with thoughtful design. Not shown in the photos we viewed  is the beautiful view of the surrounding rugged hillside. Simply beautiful! if you want to experience small town village life and culture in Greece  this is the place go! Of note  Lumni Beach is within walking distance of the cottage  if you are in reasonably good shape. There is a scooter and Quad rental shop in the village if you do not have a rental car. if you have a rental car  there is still a walk to Lumni Beach  which is beautiful. We don't know about Ravina Beach as we did not have time to visit that beach. In short  we could not have asked for a more comfortable and peaceful place to experience Greece!
4491923,Małgorzata September 2018 The place is in a small village  peaceful and quiet - narrow streets  olive trees and friendly people. There are really beautiful beaches a short distance away - we got there thanks to Stamatis' map. The place is wonderful  fully equipped  decorated with taste and love. Stamatis is a great host  helpful  always available. He got us from the airport and drove to the village. We regret that we stayed there for only 4 days and recommend the flat with all heart. Thank you Anastasia and Stamatis.
4491923,Fatima September 2018 This was by far our best experience on Airbnb The house was ideally located in an authentic neighborhood surrounded by beautiful beaches and great restaurants Decorated with great taste Stamatis is the ideal guest and has a great attention to details that guarantee you all the amenities  confort and cleanliness you need for an outstanding stay. He’s also full of great insights and suggestions to optimize your stay and experience  We’ve been happily surprised and delighted and highly recommend this Airbnb and host  Thank you again Stamatis!
4491923,Aine September 2018 The eco cottage is a truly beautiful and chic cottage in the peaceful village of Liapades. Beautifully decorated  luxurious  and full of thoughtful touches  it is one of the nicest places on Airbnb in which we have stayed.  We received a friendly welcome from Stamatis and his and Anastasia’s communication was excellent.  The cottage is a short walk through an idyllic olive grove to some wonderful beaches. We really enjoyed our stay.
4491923,Sally September 2018 The cosy eco-cottage is a really beautiful little village house which has all the charm of its old traditional origins combined with all the modern comforts and luxuries we needed. It is full of lovely touches which make it very pretty and welcoming so that we felt instantly at home. It is perfectly situated in quiet and friendly Liapades with a stunning view of the hills and a 15 minute walk through olive groves to the wonderful beach of Rovinia. Stamatis was extremely welcoming  helpful and hospitable  even meeting us at the airport despite the late hour  and helped to make it a wonderful holiday. We will be back - if there is ever a time when the house isn't already booked!
4491923,Ian August 2018 The cottage is a real gem. It has been renovated with no expense spared and with amazing attention to detail. I have never rented a home this clean and with absolutely everything you need already there. The air conditioning was very welcome in August but there are also insect screens allowing fresh air ventilation at night. The terrace outside is also lovely with a view over the valley although insect repellent is recommended outside in the evening  (also if you go out to eat).  We were given an upgrade by our car rental company (Skoda Octavia/Superb) but we should not have accepted. I definitely recommend taking a small car! The Corfu streets are very narrow and this large Skoda just did not fit down the narrow Liapades streets. But no worries. Stamatis showed us where to park and drove our luggage to the house. Even he had to clap his wing mirrors shut and scraped them along the walls at the narrowest point! The house is everything you can see in the pictures and more. A wonderful property! Stamatis was very helpful  always asking (via Airbnb) if everything was ok. The cool drinks in the fridge and other essentials on arrival were very welcome and Stamatis offered fresh sheets and towels during the week if required. We also spent one afternoon on the beach with him and his kids and it was very enlightening to learn more first hand about the Greek situation.  If you are worried that there is no pool at the house  this is not an issue as all pools at hotels are open to the public if you buy something to drink and are just a short walk away. Our kids favorite was Shambala  a view directly over the coast and cool lounge music. Food wise  Costas Steak House is excellent and offers much more than the name suggests  the owners have just returned after 10 years in London. For a special night out we would recommend Nereids in Paleokastrítsa  very interesting menu and excellent salads. While here you should also rent out a boat (possible without a license) and visit the otherwise inaccessible beaches and islands. Bring snorkels! All in all  we have seldom felt so much at home away from home. efcharistó Stamatis! Show more
4491923,Paul August 2018 This is a fabulous little cottage  full of lovely touches and everything you could want for a comfortable stay. Stamatis is a friendly and thoughtful host  with lots of helpful advice and even brought some toys for our young children. The cottage is in a lovely  quiet part of Liapades while still within walking distance of a minimarket and some good  friendly tavernas. The beaches are beautiful  especially Rovinia Beach which is worth the walk. Lovely stay.
4491923,Alex August 2018 Stamatis and Anastasia place was lovely. Pick up from the port  an excellent location on the west of the island. The airbnb is in the village proper and feels like travelling back in time. Wonderful.
4491923,Emma July 2018 We had a lovely stay at Stamatis's place and really enjoyed the famous Greek hospitality. His mother was also very sweet and welcoming and so were his kids. The house is very nicely decorated with some very stylish touches and is located in picturesque village. Liapades is a great location to explore the north side of the island. The water in beautiful beaches nearby was freezing cold when we got there due to northern currents but if this also happens to you when you get there  don't worry it only lasts a few days. We took a boat trip to explore the nearby because that cannot be reached by foot and they were stunning.We already miss Liapades and would go back any time!
4491923,"Richard July 2018 If you dread the tourist spots and enjoy ""getting a feel"" for local life  Cosy Cottage Liapades is the place for you! On a tiny street which allows one car to travel with a hand's breadth to spare either side  it is ""just"" another home on the row. The neighbours sit out on their steps in the evening to chat  some of the older women in traditional head-dresses. Sit at a table in one of the tavernas on the village square  100 m walk  and watch village life  not least a small  bossy dog we christened ""the mayor""  who does his rounds checking up on everything.  The cottage is even better than the photos show  especially the outside room at the front where we spent hours reading and enjoying the view and sounds. Walk through the olive groves to Rovinia beach for a swim and to catch another look at the colours of the sea. Snorkelling strongly recommended!  Stamatis and his mother took excellent care of us  even with gifts of fresh eggs  cucumber and lettuce. To be collected from the airport was a real bonus - no stress about finding the house.  We couldn't recommend a stay highly enough! Show more"
4491923,Cathy June 2018 A place of beauty where you can connect with the villagers and the natural surroundings. Not “touristic” place at all. If you are looking for the real thing in Corfu  this is it. Amazing views from “Horizon” restaurant and “‘Acapulco Bar” A car is good but very tight.
4491923,Nikolai June 2018 Great place  my family is extremely happy from the experience
4491923,Sylvia June 2018 Great cottage in a little village just a short drive to the beach. Walking it is possible if you don't have kids  but it's a great walk too lots to see. Designated parking spot is also a walk to cottage but every walk we made we met someone new. Home is beautiful  very clean and homey! Great overall!
4491923,Varpu June 2018 The cottage was very cosy and clean  with all the necessity appliances and more. Stamatis was very helpful and provided us with information of the village. We arrived quite late and he picked us up at the airport and had stocked the fridge so we had something to eat and drink in the evening and for breakfast. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting a relaxing stay off the beaten track  5/5!
4491923,Sue May 2018 A really cosy eco-cottage with great facilities and a lovely  enclosed patio with awnings and a beautiful view. You are right in the old part of Liapades with 3 beaches to walk to and lovely places to eat al fresco. Our host  Statatis was so helpful and gave us a tour of the village  recommending walks  beaches and places to eat. On a very practical note: brilliant mosquito screens - no bites at all to report!
4491923,Oliver May 2018 It was an excellent stay  one of our best experiences with AirBnB. The house was as described  very clean  everything available  in walking distance to beaches  restaurants  etc. Stamatis was so friendly and patient while waiting for us at the airport after delay in the middle of the night. Many thanks
4491923,Morgan May 2018 Great place to discover Corfu especially for families that like walking and swimming. Liapades is very authentic and well located to discover the whole island  which deserves definitively more than a 6 hours stop in Corfu Town. We spent a full week with our 2 kids and could have stayed longer.. The cottage is great and the atmosphere unique.
4491923,Johanna April 2018 Stamatis is a great host and the cottage is as beautiful as depicted in the photographs. It has a really nice space outside to enjoy the view and the mild springy mornings and evenings. The village is also quite cosy  with a couple of small and idyllic natural beaches nearby. It was a great place to relax and enjoy the beautiful landscape of Corfu.
4491923,Emma April 2018 Lovely place to stay. The cottage is beautifully done out and the location is great being only a 10-15 minute walk to local beaches.
4491923,Bridget Victoria Ann April 2018 Beautiful cottage in a warm friendly village. Walking distance from spectacular beaches and olive groves
4491923,Robert April 2018 This is a gorgeous little cottage  comfortable and convenient in equal measure. It's close enough to the main town to be easily accessible  but it feels very definitely secluded and away from tourist hotspots. The hosts are incredibly thoughtful and looked after us very well  even meeting us at the airport and leaving us some complementary food in the cottage. The village is also lovely and near to some wonderful beaches. All in all  highly recommended.
4491923,Noel April 2018 The flat is very stilish  great hospitality  easy to go to a couple of beaches by foot or by car. The flat is in an authentic village where people are very welcoming. Thank you for the help and the treats! I recommend it 100%
4491923,Tamira October 2017 This is a wonderful home  nicely appointed. Both bedrooms are good size. The amenities are very tasteful and thoughtful. It is a short 10-15 minute walk to the beach and a nice quiet get away!
4491923,"Alison October 2017 Just spent a lovely week at Cosy Eco Cottage in Liapades. What a wonderful property. Very well presented and has everything you could want. Stamatis  the owner  was great and even left us some ""goodies"" such as milk  bread  bottles of water  butter and jam. Liapades is a lovely traditional village but is a bit on the hilly side which you should be aware of. Beaches are fabulous and there is a bus service into Corfu town. Lovely taverns and it's great sitting in the village square watching the traffic! Stamatis really looks after you and I would recommend his cottage to couples."
4491923,Julie October 2017 We loved our stay at the Cozy Eco Cottage  it is just as beautiful as the photos and was very convenient to walk to beaches and restaurants in Liapades. The owners were very helpful and were very responsive to any questions we had. We would stay at this home again in a heartbeat!
4491923,Mark September 2017 Very cozy place in a authentic village at the edge of a very large olive tree grove  and it’s located on the Corfu trail. Beautiful beaches are easy to reach by foot. Access to the house is not easy as the road is very narrow  but Stamatis is ready to help!
4491923,Charlie September 2017 We had an amazing time at the cosy eco cottage  the cottage was beautiful and very clean and the village was lovely and quiet and close to many beautiful beaches. We rented quad bikes to get around and using the map stamatis had given us  it was fairly easy to find our way around. We had an amazing holiday  one that I will never forget! So thank you to Stamatis and Anastasia for being wonderful hosts!
4491923,Ulrike August 2017 Great location  lovely house  beautiful beaches and a wonderful host! Response from Stamatis August 2017 Thanks a lot Uli for your kind words!We hope to see again in the future!
4491923,Alexis August 2017 Thi sis a lovely apartment with a great outdoor space that we found very relaxing and peaceful to sit and enjoy our meals in. Stamatis  was an excellent host and kindly provided a few provisions to get us started when we arrived. I would highly recommend this property as a lovely base from which you can explore the west coast of the Island and also get across to Corfu Town relatively quickly.
4491923,Nancy July 2017 A quiet back street in the old part of the village  this is somewhere away from the tourist spots to relax and unwind. The eco cottage has everything you could possibly require for a comfortable stay with comfy beds  well appointed kitchen  loads of extra towels and bedding  lovely shower room  wifi  Stamatis is a very welcoming and helpful host who kindly left us lots of goodies (wine  fruit  butter  honey etc) as well as essentials such as laundry liquid  loo roll etc others expect you to buy. Highly recommended. Response from Stamatis July 2017 Thanks a lot Nancy for your kind words.I m so happy that you had a wanderful stay in my village.We hope to see again in the future.Best wishes.
4491923,Sandra July 2017 Anastasia and Stamatis are amazing hosts. They took great lengths to pick up my son from the airport. Later  our luggage was picked up as well so that we could be free to spend the afternoon however we wished. Lovely people. The accomodation is superbly well furnished and impeccably clean. It became clear to us while we were staying there that a great deal of thought and work is invested in the place. Our hosts have missed their true calling: they wouldve been amazing at running a hotel. All in all  one of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. Professionally undertaken with a sincere personal touch. Response from Stamatis July 2017 Many thanks Sandra for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Alex July 2017 Where to begin.... Stamatis the host was ever so gracious making two trips to the airport due to charges in our travel plans. Very appropriate and thank you! The property is located in the village of Liapades which is north west of the island and in my opinion has access to the most beautiful beaches and sea on the island. What's more amazing is you immerse yourself with the locals  their culture instead of other tourists! Which is what I my partner and I prefer when vacationing. The Eco Cottage has been lovingly and painstakingly restored in keeping with the original features such as the stone walls  just beautiful and inclusion of modern day comforts such as AC & Wifi  comfortable beds  fully equipped kitchen  bathroom washing machine and the most beautiful courtyard for relaxing on your vacation. The host Stamatis went above and beyond  attending to any needs plus providing ample information about the island and village including a personalised map which worked a treat. My only regret is that I did not stay long enough  however I plan to visit again!!! Response from Stamatis July 2017 Many thanks Alex for your kind words and for your nice review..We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Melanie June 2017 This cottage is amazingly. So beautifully presented and has everything you need to make it feel like home. Including bread  wine  juice  tea & coffee. Breakfast every morning on a the front porch was divine. Stamatis met us at the airport and we followed him back to the house in our hire car  via a supermarket to pick up any supplies we needed. At the house you park down the street and walk 300m to the cottage. A magnificent location to check out local beach Resort and other nearby beaches. We couldn't recommend this place highly enough.
4491923,Randy June 2017 First off  everyone should know this house is everything you want for a vacation. Clean  new feel in a perfectly old setting. The town of Liapades is charming  fun to walk  very small  not commercial. Stamatis greeted us and led us through the very narrow streets ( not car friendly)  to his lovely home. The fridge was stocked with wine  water  juice  bread. Great start  with markets close by to get everything else. There is a walk from car to house  so make sure this doesn't bother you. At first I found it annoying  then charming. The beaches are all within a 10 minute drive and are stunning. Clear water  with the most beautiful views. All require a steep downhill walk  but worth every step. Costas has amazing grilled meat if you're a carnivore. 30 minute drive to Kerkyra  which is steeped in history and feels like a mix of New Orleans meets Florence. Salto is excellent wine bar/ bistro. We will be back!
4491923,Ian June 2017 This cottage and its location in the heart of Liapades village is fantastic. The surrounding beaches  restaurants and places of interest are the best in Corfu if you are looking to keep away from the major crowds. We were a family of three generations and all had a great time. The cottage and hosts made us feel totally welcome including being greeted by Stamatis at the airport on arrival.
4491923,Markus May 2017 The welcome of Stamatis was very very friendly. He met us at the car rental and we drove together to the Appartement. At the Appartement it was very clean and lovely decorated. The fridge was already full with snacks and wine. The communication with Stamatis and his parents  who live next to the Appartement was also very friendly. They also brought us eggs from the chickens. We would totally recommend this cottage.
4491923,Hannah May 2017 The cottage is absolutely beautiful. We had a great time! Stamatis met us at the airport and very kindly let us follow him in our hire car back to the cottage. The village streets are very narrow so I would definitely recommend parking down the road. It is only a 5 minute walk. The cottage is very clean and comfortable with all modern conveniences. A cleaner came halfway through our stay and provided fresh bed linen and towels which is really above and beyond what we expected! There was also a nice view of the mountains from the terrace. The locals are friendly and there are shops and places to eat out just down the road. The narrow streets of Liapades are great to explore. We would recommend Rovina and Limni beaches which are within walking distance of the house. I would 100% recommend Stamatis's place if you are planning to visit Corfu. Response from Stamatis May 2017 Thank you so much Hannah for your nice review!We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Nathalie April 2017 Lovely éco cottage on a typical old village Response from Stamatis April 2017 Thanks Nathalie for your nice review!
4491923,Carrie April 2017 This is a really lovely AirBnB. The house is beautifully done and in a wonderful location. We enjoyed being in a traditional village with easy access to stunning  remote beaches. Stamatis and his family were incredibly warm and welcoming - Greek hospitality at its finest! Response from Stamatis April 2017 Many thanks Carrie and James for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Jude April 2017 The cosy eco cottage in Liapades was the perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. The cottage is full of old charm whilst having all the modern facilities you would expect. The covered veranda was gorgeous and the perfect place for breakfast  coffee or a siesta with a book! It was super clean and located in the very friendly old village of Liapades. Rovinia beach was a short and beautiful walk down through the olive groves and at this time of the year we had the place pretty much to ourselves. Stamatis  our host  was extremely generous and thoughtful and always available should we have any questions or need any help. I would thoroughly recommend a holiday in the cosy eco cottage Liapades. Response from Stamatis April 2017 Thanks a lot Jude for your nice review. We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Dean January 2017 This is a wonderful  high quality house in a very quiet  quant little town. We stayed in Winter and were looking for peace and quiet and certainly got this. Anastasia's house is very well maintained  with a great indoor fire place. Her mother took excellent care of us  and the town was very friendly. Communication was easy. Very happy! Thanks! Response from Stamatis January 2017  Many thanks for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.   Show more
4491923,Thomas October 2016 We rented a car and Stamatis had met us at the village. He offered to pick us up from the airport which we declined as arrived at midnight. Host and his mother who lives next house provided great hospitality and mother brought us fresh fruits and olive oil. We were also provided with food supplies for the first meal. House is in the middle of an old village by the narrow street which was meticulously and tastefully renovated. Has 2 bedrooms on 2 levels but bathroom is only downstairs which is a little hassle if you need use it at night. Beds are wide and comfortable with node bed linen. As it is the middle of ancient village there is no much of a view but there a nice sheltered porch to eat breakfast. Street is so narrow that car has to be very small to get there. We were parking 300m away in the olive groove. It was OK giving us opportunity of morning and evening walk. Acccess to the beach requires long hike an return steep uphill which would be way too much for us (we are in late 60ties). For us car appeared an obvious necessity. In October parking close to any beach was not a problem but I assume in the middle of the season this might be a challenge. Overall we enjoyed the stay in this beautiful house.       Show more
4491923,Emma October 2016 This place is absolutely amazing. The house is a very comfortable with everything you need. There is an outside area for chilling out with stunning views of the hills. Stamatis and Anastasia are brilliant hosts; very generous with excellent communication. Stamatis offered to pick us up at the airport however as we had hired a car  he met us in the village. There are no road names or house numbers in the village which can be a little confusing  so best to meet at the airport or a designated cafe/place in the village.  The village is gorgeous and the locals very friendly. A handful of great restaurants and supermarkets. There are lots of amazing beaches in the area and even better if you can hire a boat or kayak to get to the less populated ones along the coast. I can't wait to return sometime. Definitely recommend it. 10/10. Response from Stamatis October 2016 Many thanks for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Anne October 2016 Stamatis kindly met us and guided us to the cottage. The cottage was beautiful - everything was of a high quality. Location was superb - Liapades is a lovely small village and the local people were very friendly. There are a few food shops & restaurants within easy walking distance. There are three beaches - all within walking distance. Although we had a car - there is also a local bus service. The whole experience was very relaxing and we hope to return in the future - highly recommended this accommodation. Response from Stamatis October 2016 Thanks a lot Anne for your nice review. We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Stacy September 2016 This was just the most amazing Airbnb I've ever stayed in. The hosts are amazing! They picked us up from the airport at 1 in the morning  and even provided us with breakfast. The town is beautiful and the beaches are close and amazing. It's definitely a must stay for everyone.
4491923,Birgit September 2016 Stamatis was really helpful  picked us up at the Gouvia marina and drove us to Liapades. It's nice to live in the middle of natives instead of one of the Tourist places closer to the beach. It' just a few minutes to the village square with it's many cafes and a grill room operated by a really friendly lady. We appreciated the fruit  bread  coffee etc. Stamatis and Anastasia had prepared im the beautiful cottage. You can see and feel the love thy invested! Thanks for everything and greetings to your mother. Response from Stamatis September 2016 Many thanks for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Lee And Mauricia September 2016 Anastasia's husband  Stamatis  was able to give us a ride from Corfu Town. When I accidentally left my wallet in his car  he immediately drove back from Corfu Town to deliver it to us. He and Anastasia left us food  wine and bottled water  as well as a hand drawn map of the town and other helpful information. The town has its own beautiful beaches. Bus travel to and from Liapades is pretty limited and there are no taxis stationed there. There are many good places to eat and several markets. The people are friendly. The house  recently remodeled  is hundreds of years old. It was a fun experience staying there.
4491923,Sally September 2016 We had a fantastic stay  the cottage is pretty & well equipped & the hosts very helpful & friendly. Response from Stamatis September 2016 Thanks a lot Sally for your nice review. We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.  Αύγουστος 2016 Show more
4491923,Emma August 2016 Stamatis was very welcoming to us and did everything he could to make our stay as pleasant as possible  even leaving us a very nice bottle of wine and bringing a second when we said how much we enjoyed it!. He gave us excellent tips for Corfu town and left detailed notes and maps of where to go locally. The village is very friendly and we can recommend a Giros pitta for lunch in the square. The walk to the nicest beach Rovinia Beach is a good 20 mins from the house and steep coming back but is beautiful and the water is very clear  there is a little canteen boat on the beach for drinks and snacks. There are plenty of swimming pools you can can use within a 5-10 min walk  you just need to buy a drink to use them. There is a mid week clean and the towels and linen are lovely  they even leave beach towels for your use. There is a good local bus service (green buses) and we had a very fun day out at Aqualand which the kids loved. Overall we had a wonderful week and were really relaxed on our return to the UK.
4491923,Jenny August 2016 Excellent holiday! Thank you .
4491923,Krystel August 2016 We had a really great time in Liapades. It was amazing to discover this true authentic village and meet the island's people  who are the rarest type of nice! A pittoresque village leading to probably one of the most beautiful beaches in the world: Rovinia. Walking back from Rovinia beach to our guesthouse house is a 25 minute walk with a small uphill. It is better to rent a car if you are staying for more than three days. You can also find quad and motorbike rentals in the village.
4491923,Christian July 2016 Lovely property with all amenities required  tastefully decorated and very clean. Within walking distance to the beach and tucked away in a small friendly Comunity with nice cafe  places to eat and small grocery shops. Ideal retreat.
4491923,John July 2016 What can we say  but this was just an idyillc holiday. Besides the cottage which was superb  with very comfortable beds  air conditioning and really cleverly designed in every way. Stamatis kindly picked us up at the airport with his lovely daughter Mia (hope I spelt that right). He's parents lived next door and were very kind to us and at the same time always respecting our privacy. And as for the local people  they were very nice and we made some great friends while there. have to say we were all very sad (the four us of leaving  but we vowed  we would be back.) thank you so much guys.

4491923,Alexa July 2016 A wonderful home for our corfu holiday  beautifully renovated and modernised to a high standard. Very quiet which was bliss! Tucked away in a little traditional village  Liapades is unspoilt and simple and offers decent restaurants  a supermarket and a few stores all the way down to the main beach. We didn't rent a car but walked everywhere - a lot of downhill and uphill walking but keeps you fit! Local beaches are simple. I would recommend hiring mopeds or a car if you don't like walking! Local bus service very good though. The owners had thought of everything and were so helpful.
4491923,Natalie June 2016 Our stay was great! Stamatis (Anastasia's husband) picked us up from the airport and was so welcoming and kept in contact to ensure everything was ok! The house is beautiful and the surrounding beaches are stunning.
4491923,Christine June 2016 This is a beautiful cottage in the heart of one of Corfu's loveliest villages. It has been refurbished to an excellent standard  and combines a full range of modern conveniences with traditional design features. It is also extremely conveniently positioned  just minutes from the village square and a variety of tavernas and restaurants  and only 15-20 minutes from some lovely beaches.  I can't praise the hosting skills of Stamatis and Anastasia highly enough. They were extremely responsive and helpful in the run-up to the trip; when we arrived  Stamatis picked us up at the airport and drove us to the cottage  briefly taking us through the lovely Corfu town en route. The cottage was stocked with some lovely welcome provisions  and Stamatis provided us with a useful map of the village and a list of recommended restaurants and beaches. He checked in with us throughout the week and helped us to arrange our return travel to the airport. HIs mum  who lives next door  also dropped in to bring us some fresh eggs and fruit and veg from her garden. We have rarely felt so welcome  and very much hope we'll have the opportunity to visit the beautiful spot again.

4491923,Rosie June 2016 We were warmly greeted by Stamatis and his son at the airport and then they even took us for a little tour of Corfu Town on the way to the cottage!  We were given a hand drawn map (wonderful) and some food and wine for the place.  The cottage was quite simply the most beautiful place I have ever stayed and I have done quite a bit of travelling!  I cannot fault the cottage or the village itself. Liapedes is stunning and the beaches are excellent if you want a quiet place to relax.  I am already planning my next trip!  Hugely recommend :)  Response from Stamatis June 2016 Many thanks for your nice review. We are so happy that you had a wonderful stay in Corfu at Liapades.We hope to see again in the future. Best wishes.
4491923,Sandra June 2016 This is a little piece of Heaven! Everything that we had hoped for and more; the house is situated in an idyllic area in the traditional village of Liapades amidst the Greek community away from tourism. There are three delightful beaches within 15-20 minutes by foot. There are excellent tavernas close by  and small supermarkets for groceries. It is in the middle of the Corfu trail  ideally situated for walkers. We had finished the South trail and the house was a welcome retreat after the 7 day trek. The house is stylishly presented with all home comforts  including very comfortable mattresses and bed linen ensuring a restful sleep. We were made very welcome by Anastasia and Stamatis  who came to greet us on arrival. Amelia  mother of Stamatis  lives next door. She was there to help and very kindly gave us fresh lemons from her tree  eggs from her hens and lettuce from her garden.
4491923,Anna June 2016 Anastasia and Stamatis took such good care of us! They were extremely welcoming and accommodating. They're place was beautiful and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend their place to anyone wanting a getaway on the beautiful island of Corfu.
4491923,"Peter May 2016 We had wonderful days in this lovely cottage. Everything was very fine (as described in the inserat). We highly recommend this place with his hosts!  Stamatis hat uns (2 Erwachsene + 2 Kinder) mitten in der Nacht vom Flughafen abgeholt + (mit unserem Mietwagen) zu unserer Unterkunft gebracht. Der Kühlschrank war schon für das Frühstück am nächsten Morgen gefüllt - sehr angenehm. In der Hütte haben wir alles in TOP-Zustand vorgefunden  sehr sauber + ausgestattet  wie im Inserat beschrieben. Für vier Personen ist die Unterkunft groß genug  um auch Regentage darin verbringen zu können (wir hatten einen). Angenehm ist auch die Terrasse/der kleine ""Hof"" vor dem Haus; er ist überdacht (zum Schutz vor Sonne + Regen). Liapades ist ein kleines Bergdorf mit freundlichen Bewohnern (die Mutter von Stamatis wohnt gleich nebenan). Alles ist fußläufig erreichbar. Zum Strand (wir haben drei davon erkundet) kommst du zu Fuß (ca. 15  20  50 min). Vor dem Haus ist Parken für (Miet-)Autos nicht empfehlenswert/möglich; eine Parkmöglichkeit ist ca. 200 m entfernt.  Wir haben uns in der Hütte sehr wohl gefühlt + täglich gespürt  dass wir willkommen sind. Danke für die gute Zeit! Show more Response from Stamatis May 2016 Many thanks for your nice review.

4491923,Tobias May 2016 A wonderful cottage  v tastefully decorated and a very interesting history. Stamatis met us at the airport and showed us the way  and there was a lovely selection of local treats on arrival. He showed us the parking (4mins walk from the house) then kindly took us and our luggage through the impossibly narrow streets. He even turned up when we left to help with our bags  and he and Anastasia were always available via phone/airbnb chat.  Liapades is a lovely relaxed authentic village - if you're unsure  then just go for it: you won't be disappointed.
4491923,Laurent May 2016 We’ve spent two very nice weeks in the house of Stamatis with our little family of four (a baby and a 4 year old boy). The house is clean and cosy and looks just like in the pictures. Stamatis is a very helpful and hospitable host. He came to pick us up at the airport and came by several times during our stay to see if he could be of any help. We arrived the weekend of Easter and were invited to join his family for dinner on Easter Sunday (including the traditional whole lamb on the spit). It was really special to be part of this important moment in Greek culture. Liapades is a nice little village and we loved walking around and enjoying the kindness of the population  especially towards our children. There are several beautiful little beaches in the environment of Liapades and a lot of opportunities for nice walks. We can recommend a stay at the cosy eco cottage!
4491923,Alex May 2016 Great host with excellent communication before hand  good check-in process and complimentary water and wine in the fridge. Had a lovely stay and enjoyed the area very much.
4491923,James April 2016 We had a lovely three days in anastasia's beautiful house. It's a nice quiet space in the middle of the old part of the village which we thoroughly enjoyed. There are some great walks up from the house through the old olive groves that surround the village with the bonus of secluded beaches if you can find them. Well worth persevering. It feels like real Corfu.
4491923,Emily April 2016 I loved the listing right away  the character of the house was apparent from the first picture. We had an absolutely amazing time at the cottage it was in the perfect location between 2 beaches and so close to the town centre  many bars and an amazing restaurant. We will definitely be visiting again!
4491923,Paola & Felix April 2016 We had a fantastic easter break in Corfu. Anastasia and Stamatis were very welcoming and helpful hosts. Stamatis met us at the airport and made sure we had everything we needed before leaving us to enjoy this lovely cottage with its special charm. It was beautiful and looked exactly as shown on the images. It was absolutely spotless upon our arrival and the terrace has a beautiful mountain view. Liapades is a nice little old village with very friendly and welcoming neighbours. The kids enjoyed the pebble beach with its crystal clear water  which is about a 15 minute walk away and a new five-a-side football pitch in the village. Due to its central location the cottage is ideally situated to explore both the north and the south of corfu by car  which we can only recommend as this beautiful island has so much to offer.
4491923,Catherine January 2016 A truly beautiful place to stay! It felt like home. Every comfort has been thought of  and no detail has been overlooked. The house is full of character and style and has been finished to a very high standard. The hosts looked us after so well  and made sure that we had everything we needed from the first moment. It is located in a beautiful  old village and is located within easy reach of beaches  mountains  great tavernas and also Corfu Town. We highly recommend it!
4491923,Laura October 2015 We have had the most wonderful week exploring and getting to know Corfu. Stamatis kindly picked us up from the airport and took us to the house. He had kindly left a bottle of wine  water  juice and breakfast. The house is cosy  charming  impeccably clean  very well equipped and much larger than it looks on the photos. It is beautifully and tastefully decorated with very clever eco features. The kitchen has everything you could possibly need  with cooking essentials supplied like salt pepper  herbs and oil etc. The courtyard is very pretty with beautiful views of the mountains beyond. Word of warning! When you take the key out to lock door at night  all lights go off. Lights only go on again if you return key to slot! Very clever but confusing if you not expecting it ! Liapades  out of season is very quiet. Most of the tavernas were closed except the beach bar and pizza restaurant. In peak season  I expect it would be a lot busier as there are many tavernas   bars and restaurants to choose from. The village is very quaint and traditional with tiny narrow roads that lead to the house at the top of the village. Beaches are beautiful  in particular Rovinia and Limni beach  which is quite difficult to find!! I wouldn't recommend Liniodoros beach for children as it is a very very long  steep hike down and up  made worse when we visited by scree that had washed down the path from a recent storm!! We rented scooters from the village  but there is also a car hire place  motorbikes and quad bikes. Boats are available from the main beach {Gefyra} in high season. Surrounding area that we would recommend visiting are Paleokastritsa and the monastery and beautiful beaches on W coast and   Kalami and Nissaki On E coast. {The White House in Kalami is a very good place to eat with lots of traditional and varied cuisine } Doukades is a very sweet traditional village inland with places to eat in the square that seemed to still be open out of season. Lakones has beautiful views of the coast At Krini  go down to Angelokastro Castle Many thanks to Anastasia and Stamatis for making such a beautiful and charming house and making our stay so comfortable and welcoming. We will definitely be back and hope this review is useful to your future guests  Laura and Lottie x Show more
4491923,Barbara October 2015 Anastasia's lovely husband met us at the airport and helped us to get some supplies from the local supermarket when we reached Liapades  Huge help as the supermarket is about a mile down the road and we didn't have any transportation. They supplied water  bread and basics like coffee and butter and jam as well. The cottage is very well renovated and comfortable. The beach was rather further away than we expected - I have some arthritis in my knees so it took quite a while to reach it. It was lovely with crystal clear water. We had a bit of a 'Corfu' moment when they changed the bus schedule from one day to the next without any notification. Look at the schedule the day that you want to travel to Corfu town to minimize sitting there wondering if the bus is ever going to arrive. Stannis's mother lives next door and she is very welcoming and willing to be helpful in whatever way is needed. We had a bit of a problem trying to figure out the oven and she offered to have us come and use her kitchen. It got resolved.
4491923,Anna October 2015 Our stay in Anastasia’s and Stamatis’ house exceeded our expectations and we wished we could have stayed there longer. The house is truly beautiful (furnished with attention to detail)  very comfortable and very well equipped – all you could think of is there (all necessary kitchen appliances  coffee machine  hair dryer etc.). The outside sitting area is great  with a nice mountain view. The house is located around 100 m from the main square of the village (which is where the locals go in the evenings). We had travelled around Corfu before arriving in Liapades and we can truly recommend Liapades as one of the nicest areas (if not the nicest) in Corfu. It is a peaceful village with landscape unspoiled by overwhelming tourists’ infrastructure (definitely for visitors looking for some local flavor). Also the people we met in Liapades seemed nicer than in other areas in Corfu which I think is an advantage of going to places were not so many tourist go. Stamatis was a great host. He met us outside the village  led us to the house  explained everything to us and showed us around the village. We got a map from him and recommendation on restaurants and beaches.  Both Anastasia's house and Liapades are highly recommended !!! Show more
4491923,Anja September 2015 My family (2 adults and two small children (2 and 3 years old)) spent 3 wonderful weeks in this house in Liapades. We absolutely loved every day there. It is an old house  recently refurbished with great taste and attention to details. There is absolutly evetything in place to feel at home. We loved the beautiful veranda where you can relax outside. Anastasia and Stamatis are fantastic hosts  very friendly and attentive. They made our stay very comfortable  and cared about all details.  We traveled around Corfu  and believe we were very lucky to choose Liapades for our holiday. It is one of most beautiful  and at the same time less crouded  quiet place with a beautiful beach within a walking distance (some healthy walk of around 10-15 min). Also you can rent a taxi boat to travel to other numerous beaches. I would like to mention the beauty of the Liapades village itself and the olive groves around it. The air is so incredibly fresh!  In the village the are several tavernas and minimarkets  bike and car hires  so you can get absolutely everything you need on the spot. However in the house you are never disturbed by any noise.  The house exceeded our expectations! It was one of the best holidays ever! Thank you! Show more
4491923,Elvira August 2015 We have had one of the most memorable holidays in Anastasia and Stamatis' cottage. The accommodation is delightful  it even exceeded our expectations. High specs  spotless  with everything we needed and more. The neighbourhood is perfect  local shops you can buy everything. Every morning my daughter and I  would walk to the bakery to buy pastries for a delicious breakfast. There are local restaurants which sell amazing and very affordable foods which you can walk to. It was very important for us to be able to walk to shops  restaurants  even a beautiful beech  Rovinia. The hosts are amazing. Anastasia will recommend and highlight the best places to see in Corfu'. We followed her advice and have visited the most fantastic beaches  historical sites  and some of the best restaurants on the island. There is a car rental company in Liapades which  again Anastasia recommended to us. A great place for a great holiday!
4491923,Costenciuc August 2015 We had perfect holiday in Liapades. The nearest beach is Rovinia with cristal-blue water  white rocks. About 5 minutes by car you can arrive at Paleokastritsa  is the best places in Corfu i think. About 15 minutes by car you can arrive at the capital(port) Kerkira . The villa is the best and have everything you need during you stay here. The villa is bigger then photos they put. Great terrace  here you can chill after all day staying on the beach. Thank you!!!
4491923,Josefa August 2015 The perfect holiday in the perfect cottage in Liapades! Thank you Anastasia and Stamatis for this great opportunity for such a wonderful holiday in Korfu! we enjoyed our stay in the lovely house  that is so beautifully renovated and furnished with a lot of taste. with all the great advice and care from Anastasia and Stamatis we have seen a lot of Korfu and felt almost as locals - only our non existant Greek language knowledge disturbed this impression ;-). Liapades is a pittoresque village with great infrastructure and the best beach is in walking distance :). Everything was according to the descpritions and better. We will definitely come back! Response from Stamatis August 2015 Thank you so much for such a great review Josefa!!! We are so pleased to hear that you had such a lovely time over here. We are very lucky to have families like yours staying in our home. We'd love to see you again soon!!!!
4491923,Karin July 2015 Stamatis och Anastasia was really helpful and welcoming. Upon arrival Stamatis showed us the village  which is beautiful and authentic. The cottage itself is a bliss. Cosy  clean and with a historical touch. Stamatis was kind enough to give us breakfast and a bottle of wine. Sitting by the patio and looking at the mountains was a really beautiful view. The beautiful rovinja beach was amazing!
4491923,Anna July 2015 The place of Anastasia and Stamatis is Great  a small house exactly as you see in the photos  in a beautiful village. you don't feel the touristic side of Corfu there! the beds are for super sleep and Stamatis even picked us up from the airport thank you!A beautiful beach  Rovinia  is nearby but still difficult to go there by feet in summer months with the heat.Plan a vehicle and you can park it near the house(8min walk).Great house  made with love and taste!
4491923,Tatiana July 2015 We passed a wonderful week in Anastasia and Stamatis cottage. Everything you need is there. Liapades is a nice  little village with narrow roads and a beautiful square. From there you can reach every important places of Korfu. Anastasia and Stamatis are great host  they were always in contact with us and made us feel at home. We would come back anytime. Thanks to you two  you made our stay very comfortable.
4491923,Alastair June 2015 This is a really nice  recently refurbished cottage. The owners were very helpful in guiding us from the airport to the house and making sure we had everything we needed. The location is perfect close to the town and restaurants etc while also a short walk to some excellent beaches. Good sized bedrooms and a nice veranda area outside  couldn't fault it.
4491923,Jo June 2015 Charming hosts who went out of their way to make us welcome. All the amenities you would expect of a well thought through airbnb set up. Comfortable  clean  stocked with the little touches thrown in too. Very much in the centre of a traditional Corfiot town  so much more authentic an experience than much of the packaged naff elsewhere on offer. Highly recommend in sum.
4491923,Liselot May 2015 We loved our stay in the cottage! When we arrived at the airport late at night  Stamatis was there to guide us to the cottage. Once we were there we felt very comfortable right away. The cottage is very cosy and everything you need i there! Even stuff for small children. We loved the little outside area to relax. The village is small and nice. The beaches are close by and with a car its very easy to explore the island. During our stay Anastesia and Stamatis were our personal travel guides. We could contact them at any time and they gave us great tips for things to do  wich made our stay even more comfortable. Thank you Anastesia and Stamatis for the wonderul time!
4491923,Susanne April 2015 Wonderful  lovely and urban cottage..we really loved it. Everything was fine  the cottage is in best condition  new renovated and with very good equipment. It's in a small urban village in Corfu...the residents are very polite and helpful...and they loved our 2 kids. The contact to Anastasia and her husband was so nice and anxious. 3 beaches are near the village (appr. 15 min walk or by car) and other nice places are near the location. We recommend to rent a small car to explore this beautiful island. I guess that it will be not our last visit at Corfu...thanks Anastasia and Stamatis for hosting us.
4491923,Penelope April 2015 Anastasia and her husband were very thoughtful  helpful and welcoming  meeting us at the airport  guiding us to the house  explaining how everything worked and answering our questions about the village and surrounding area. The house was well equipped  tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean. They had thoughtfully provided us with a bowl of fruit  bottles of water and a bottle of wine. The village was friendly with a couple of bars and souvlaki restaurants  and the local shop was well stocked with necessary provisions. Liapades is a delightful village and is well positioned for exploring the area. We enjoyed our stay immensely. Response from Stamatis April 2015 Penelope I'm so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay in our home. Thanks a lot for your kind words. It's been a pleasure meeting you all!
4491923,Nadine September 2022 We felt very comfortable in the house of Stamatis. After a warm welcome with many tips for the area  we were able to really relax in this original place. The house is lovingly decorated  very harmonious and very clean. The small courtyard with its view of the mountains can also be highlighted. The most beautiful swimming coves of Corfu are within walking distance and in the village of Liapades you have several opportunities to eat very well (including Costas Steakhouse). It couldn't be better  we would recommend the house at any time. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Monica August 2022 stamatis is a very kind  caring person who is available! His house is fantastic and very clean. We were able to leave our car in a space reserved a few meters from the house and Stamatis took us by car with our luggage both when we arrived and when we left. In the house there was everything we needed including great peaches and other things for breakfast. the village is very quiet and we enjoyed the silence and peace in the courtyard of the house. I highly recommend Stamatis' place Translated from Italian  Show original
4491923,Julie August 2022 Liapades is a charming village  with very narrow roads  so you have to leave the car below but there is a special place and it is very nice. The house is warm  nicely decorated and there's nothing missing. The small terrace is very pleasant. The little bonuses that make a difference: the umbrella  the beach towels and the washing machine. Beautiful beaches are within walking distance   with a small elevation:-) Stamatis is a lovely host  full of good advice and attentive. Thanks for everything! Translated from French  Show original

4491923,Anke October 2021 Stamatis Cottage is truly wonderful. It is very lovingly restored and furnished. Stamatis himself is a very likeable  helpful host and does everything for you to have a good time. The village is like traveling back in time and you are up close to the original Greece. The central location allows you to explore the island very well. If you want to experience a vacation beyond package and mass tourism  this is the place to be. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Jana July 2021 It was an incredibly beautiful vacation in the house of Stamatis. The house is lovingly decorated and everything was simply thought of. Stamatis is always available and helps quickly with questions. The house is located in the old village of Liapades and is not far from the market square  there you will find a small tavern that has a really great kitchen. All the neighbours were really friendly and helpful. I'm sure we'll be back! Thank you for a wonderful holiday! Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Stephanie May 2021 The house is exactly as described. There was nothing missing. The surrounding swimming coves were the most beautiful in all of Corfu. If you like it quaint and not so touristy  this is the place to be. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Olga September 2020 We stayed in Stamatis's apartment at the end of September 2020. There was nothing wrong with it  everything was thought of: beach towels  descriptions for hiking and car routes  recommendation on restaurants  etc. We felt very comfortable. There were various games and books. Above all  however  we enjoyed breakfast in the yard. We couldn't have imagined a better stay in times of coronavirus. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Heiko August 2020 Stamatis welcomed us kindly. We had a lovely and relaxing time here. The house is very nicely decorated and we enjoyed sitting on the terrace overlooking the mountains. Liapades is an original village and an evening visit to the village square is recommended. There are many beautiful beaches in the area. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Gianna October 2019 We (2 adults and 1 child) had a wonderful week in Liapades. Stamatis and his family are absolutely hospitable  warm and attentive. There were so many nice little things that made us feel like we are at home in Corfu. We were able to walk from the house to fantastic swimming coves (stone beach with crystal clear water) & Liapades is a good starting point for excursions on the island. We used a rental car  but there are also buses. In the village itself there are opportunities for dining and also shopping. It is not possible to park directly in front of the door  but only a few meters from the house  Stamatis has its own parking space. We would go there again and again!

A very tasty little wine on arrival evening  plenty of water and a small breakfast the next morning was provided. Fixed parking at some distance. Due to seasonal construction and cars and mopeds not completely quiet. We were very nicely provided with fresh eggs and vegetables by the mom next door. For us  it was very nice to get the lively village life. Very happy to come back.

4491923,Anna-Maria August 2019 Stamatis is a great host  he picked us up in the village below and drove his car to the cottage. There  the road is so narrow that it is actually only recommended to drive to the house with a lot of driving talent. The house itself is furnished with a lot of love for detail and absolutely matches the pictures on the Internet. Stamatis was always available and totally helpful with all questions and concerns. The air conditioning in hot nights and slept wonderfully and during the day we were very often on the beautiful beach about 20-25 minutes walk away. ( You can also drive very close by car and then only have to walk about 5 minutes) The vacation there for us was perfect and we would go there again anytime!! Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Thomas April 2019 Super hosts and a good place to relax and do activities in the north-west of Corfu. The path to Corfu Town is also easily accessible by car in about 30 minutes. Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Franziska October 2018 Stamatis' house is exactly as seen in the photos. It is very tastefully and furnished with attention to detail  and we started it very clean. We felt immediately comfortable! The house is very quietly located in the middle of the locals in the small village of Liapades. The nearby beaches  which are easily accessible on foot  are really fantastic. The contact with Stamatis the host was very straightforward and accommodating. We are more than happy to recommend the house! Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Mette September 2018 An absolute insider tip. This holiday was perfect. We spent a week in this beautiful place and would book it again and again. The cottage is even more cozy than in the photos. Everything very clean and furnished with a lot of love. Stamatis is a nice attentive host who makes every effort to ensure that his guests are well. From first meals to tips on where to eat  where to eat  where to find the most beautiful stalls and what to see on the island  everything was included. We fell a little in love with the old village square in Liapades  which is only a 2-minute walk from the cottage. Here you can end the evening wonderfully and enjoy the Greek atmosphere.

4491923,Florence August 2018 Stamatis's place was just great! Stamatis picked us up from the port and had even shopped for us. The cottage is exactly as described and shown in the pictures - just beautiful! The small village is adorable  but not for large cars...On site there are all the things of daily use. The beaches are within walking distance and the water is crystal-car. For sensitive feet  swimming shoes are quite practical because of the pebble. We would go back in a heartbeat!!!

4491923,Alex Les Bons Plans July 2018 This house is super cute and warm. Nestled in the middle of the old village you will be in a quiet area. The only small negative point is the parking lot a little hard to park and 150 m but very frankly it's a very small negative point because the owner couple is very nice and helpful and the services of the house are perfect. We are quiet  it's pretty  air conditioning and wifi are there... in short we can only have a nice stay!!! Translated from French  Show original
4491923,Korinna June 2018 The apartment in Liapades is fantastic. Very tastefully decorated and lovingly and elaborately renovated in the old style. The amenities are perfect. Stamatis is a very eager and attentive host. We were also delighted by the town of Liapades. The square in front of the church is enchanting and is mostly enlivened by locals. Everyone is very friendly. The beaches are a dream  the water quality is sensational and so we had a really wonderful vacation. Due to the narrow roads  driving in the town center is a challenge. Stamatis  however  brings the luggage into the house. Translated from German  Show original

4491923,Alexander September 2017 The house is wonderful and everything is as seen in the photos. A house renovated with a lot of love with excellent facilities. Everything is really there. The house is located in Liapades  an ancient mountain village with moderate tourism. You will meet more locals than tourists here  which we (2 adults  2 children) enjoyed very much. Everything is very quiet and almost sleepy. The roads are very narrow  you should keep your distance from driving to the house. The house is in the upper part of Liapades and from the parking lot you walk about 5 minutes uphill to the house. Liapades is just 30 minutes away from Corfu town. By car  you can easily and quickly reach all the sights  beaches and hikes on the island. Stamatis is an excellent host and always responsive and helpful. He had already shopped for us for the 1st day. Would recommend to anyone looking for a secluded  original and well-maintained holiday home. 5 stars! Translated from German  Show original

Although we arrived late  he picked us up at the airport and directed us to Liapades. He was always approachable. And his mother  who lives next door  even spoiled us with goodies from her garden. Nice and atmospheric food can be enjoyed in the village square  beautiful bay within walking distance... Translated from German  Show original
4491923,Thomas October 2016 We spent a great holiday week with our 13-year-old daughter in this really beautiful cottage. The house fully complies with the description and photos  the equipment offers a high standard and you feel very comfortable there. The contact as well as the entire transaction was excellent  the extremely friendly landlord personally welcomed us at the airport and in the house even our physical well-being was ensured. The location of the accommodation has a good starting point to explore the island by car. Corfu has a lot to offer and we will come back for sure. Many thanks to Anastasia and Stamatis!

4491923,Anna September 2016 The place was beautiful. We felt very comfortable. The apartment is located in the old town of Liapades near the village square.

4491923,Sonja August 2016 We (2 adults and 2 children  5 years and 2 years) were allowed to spend two wonderful vacation weeks in Liapades. Stamatis welcomed us very warmly and showed us the way from the airport to the apartment. The apartment is simply magical and just as pretty and romantic as in the photos. Anastasia and Stamatis have created a little pearl here. It is very clean  tastefully decorated with a lot of love for detail. Upon arrival  Stamtis already bought some things such as water and fruits. Otherwise  everything went very smoothly and professionally. Other than that  Stamatis is an extremely lovable person and has spared no effort to support us. Thank you very much! With smaller children  the apartment of Anastasia and Stamatis is certainly a certain challenge  as it is located in the village on the hill and cannot be approached directly by car. This meant for us  quite a lot of sports;) With the children  on the other hand  it was ideal that we were allowed to use the pool of Villa Papoulas. If you consume drinks  ice cream  etc.  it will no longer cost anything extra. Villa Papoulas is an extremely likeable family-run business a few minutes' walk from the apartment. My parents spent their holidays there and were very satisfied. Corfu is a beautiful island. The people were all incredibly nice  straightforward and helpful. We will be back!

The house is newly renovated and furnished with taste and love. It has a wonderful little courtyard where you can sit  read and dream - of course with mountain views and lemon flower smell. A small dreamy natural beach is 1 km away.  All places  such as Corfu Town (see!) can be reached in 30 minutes - 1 hour at the most.  Our hosts provided us like family: a fruit plate  wine  coffee  tea as a welcome. Every little wish was fulfilled. Wifi  washing machine  coffee maker  full kitchen available.

5465293,Corinne August 2022 What an amazing accommodation to relax and swim whenever you want. For a famlily with kids it was absolutely perfect. We had a great holiday and will never forget our trip to Korfu. We can only sincerely recommned this accommodation to everyone. It is quiet  peaceful and serene  just the crickets on the island are something to get used to. The most amazing sunsets over the ocean right o nthe terrace or in the sea. AWESOME!!
5465293,Petra August 2021 An amazing place right by the sea  in a very quiet corner of the island  surrounded by olive trees. We rented the whole house and had a great family vacation there!
5465293,Dobrin September 2019 The place looks exactly like in the photos. The villa is well positioned  very close to a good tavern  with a view to the seaside and a yard with stairs that lead to the beach. You should know from the start that the owner lives there and he will stay there with you  in one of the rooms  even if you book the entire place. He is a good man  who respects your privacy and doesn’t bother you at all but still  he will be there in a room  even if it has its own separate entrance. We were a big group of 30 people split between 4 different accommodations in Corfu  and this villa had the most minuses. The kitchens aren’t really equipped – there were no salt  pepper  oil  we didn’t see a place for barbeque in the yard. We’re sure that if we talked to the owner  he would have helped us with all  but we didn’t want to bother him each time we needed something. The plumbing in the house is a bit old and needs some repairs  but that didn’t bother us as much. We had a good time here and if there were any problems we’re sure the owner would have solved them (he seemed the type that could solve anything)  but there are other villas nearby with better amenities and no owner staying with you.
5465293,Nike April 2018 We had an amazing time in and appreciated especially the perfect location of the house and the beautiful garden and the tiny little beach at the end of it.
5465293,Zhivko August 2017 The villa has a very pleasant yard with a lot of greenery  flowers and herbs which smell amazing. There are several sunbeds available which you can enjoy in the hot days under the shadow of several big pine trees overlooking the water. From the yard  you can directly go into the water. The sea bottom is sandy  not too rocky. There is a public beach in 5 min walking. On the beach  you can find a tavern with a wide variety of traditional dishes and fresh fish. Overall  we had a very nice stay.
5465293,Lita October 2022 A great house with a beautiful garden and spectacular views of the sea. Everything was perfect and worked out  accommodating host. Ideal for two families. Translated from German  Show original
5465293,Stéphanie Et Michel July 2022 Excellent stay with a view and direct access to the sea  taverna a 5-minute walk away. Our host Vassili is very available and pleasant. Translated from French  Show original
5465293,Jonas July 2022 Great house with a great location right on the sea! Translated from German  Show original
5465293,Anne May 2022 We had a great stay in the idyllically located house of Ajax with an incredibly paradise garden. As a group with a total of 6 adults and 5 children  the house was an optimal size  the nearby beach is very child-friendly  as is the tavern within walking distance. You definitely need a car to do your shopping. Otherwise  it is so nice that you do not have to leave the house and the immediate surroundings. The week was topped off with fantastic weather. The host is always on site and helpful  communication sometimes a bit bumpy. Overall  however  we have always managed to communicate. The contact by email with Ajax regarding excursion tips  etc.  was flawless! Thank you  we will be happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original
5465293,Mathieu August 2019 Vassilis' house is beautiful  perfect for a stay in Corfu for 8. The house overlooks the sea directly  in a secluded and very wild location. A very good and inexpensive small tavern is a stone's throw away. We had a wonderful stay in a unique environment. Translated from French  Show original
5465293,Petra June 2019 We were a group of 4 couples spread over 3 units in the same house . It was great for enjoying a little privacy. The garden was very beautiful  possibility to eat together  if you wanted  on a large table in the garden. Direct access to the beach is a plus. We had a great time. Translated from French  Show original
5465293,Jean Marc August 2018 An excellent address located in the best place on the island both in terms of tranquility and proximity to the typical village of Agios Mathéos. Translated from French  Show original
5465293,Stefano August 2017 The house is located in a quiet area  with a wonderful sea view. There are small family-run restaurants (tavernas) nearby. For those who want to tour the island of Corfu  I recommend renting a scooter  to be able to easily reach the beautiful beaches. The space and linens were clean and tidy Ajax was always prompt and accurate in communicating and accommodating our requests  such as the owner  Vasilis  who was present every day and available  also giving us the fruit from his garden. Definitely recommend! Translated from Italian  Show original
30270339,Jessica October 2022 What a wonderful find. A small and cosy house on the sea front and on the edge of a small village packed with restaurants. Morning swims (bring some plastic slip-ons and walk down the steps from the patio into the sea)and lunches in and around the village. 40 mins max from airport and lots of boat trips nearby to choose from. I want to come back again and again. I came with a friend but it would also be brilliant for a family. SUPERB. Thank you.
30270339,Geoff August 2022 A lovely  well equipped house in beautiful Boukari. Great access straight into the sea and it is great for snorkelling. The vista is stunning with sunrises and sunsets a highlight. We loved our stay here.
30270339,Sally August 2022 Everything about this place is perfect - the quality of the house and fittings   the location and the very efficient communication from the host Panos . From the moment you arrive you feel relaxed and lucky to be in such a fabulous place . If you’re after bright lights and cocktail bars this isn’t the place for you . If  however  you want a beautiful house in walking distance to several family tavernas and the sea almost to yourself   even in August then you couldn’t find anywhere better - can’t wait to come back
30270339,Nadine July 2022 thank you for all the attention to comfort and hospitality! We enjoyed swimming with the fishes right at the foot of the house  discovering the town of Corfu via a boat from Messalonghi travel center  reading to the sound of the lapping water and the singing of the crickets !
30270339,Rachel July 2022 Beautiful location. Great accommodation with everything you could need. Panos is a great host and checks in with you to make sure everything is ok. Lots of extra touches such as essentials in the fridge and a bottle of wine.
30270339,Catherine June 2022 This house was one of the nicest we have ever stayed in. What can beat waking up in the morning and walking straight out into the sea where the water was pristine?! Communication with Panos was excellent from start to finish even though we did not have the pleasure of meeting him. The house was spotlessly clean  had everything we needed and extra. A big thank you to Panos for leaving breakfast for us as we had a very late flight arriving  it was much appreciated. I would not think about booking here.... just do it!!! The location was ideal for eating out as there were enough restaurants within walking fistance to try a new one each night. You will need a car to explore the area. Overall  a fantastic holiday experience in Boukari  the best place to stay! Thank you Panos
30270339,Nathan June 2022 We had the warmest welcome from Panos's mum (thank you!) and we loved the location! It's a great position with beautiful sunsets and plenty of sunshine on the patio for us but also with great shade if needed. For us the icing on the cake were the 5 steps straight down to the sea. We swam every day then went straight back to the sunny patio to dry off. There's lots of fish to see and we downloaded the app 'Seek' to our phones to identify not only the fish we saw but plants  birds etc. It's a brilliant app and we learnt a lot about the island's 'beasties'. The apartment has absolutely everything you could need with really thoughtful touches everywhere. It was great to have a freezer too as it meant we could freeze bottles of water and take them with us for the day so we had cold water for a good few hours. Thank you for all the treats  it makes such a difference when hosts do this and we really appreciated it. It really is one of the most welcoming  lovely AirB&B we've ever stayed in and we couldn't recommend it more highly.
30270339,Mandy May 2022 Blue Horizon is stunning! Such a beautiful  clean & well equipped House. The scenery & Views are second to none & we had just the best sunniest weather! We had a wonderful stay & really hope to return soon! Thank you Panos for great communication and having us to stay at Blue Horizon.
30270339,"Ken May 2022 Panos deserves his 5* rating; ""Blue Horizons"" is a spacious house and very well maintained. It's location on the edge of the Ionian Sea is genuinely special offering interrupted views across to Corfu Town and the Greek mainland. There's a mini market a short walk along the coast and several tavernas  the best of which is easily Kalami  turn left out of the house and keep walking  past what you think is the final taverna in Boukari (Spiro's). Boukari is peaceful  if it's clubbing you want  try somewhere else! One thing to note is that it faces due north: this  along with the large covered area  limits the amount of sun on the terrace but it is unlikely to cause a problem unless there are four sunlovers vying for tans at the same time. The sunbeds provided are good and comfortable and the table and chairs on the terrace are nice quality and even more comfy. The kitchen is well stocked with pans and utensils  the washing machine was appreciated and Panos leaves plenty of spare bedding and towels available. Finally  if you have any questions or need an issue solved Panos is a great help. We thoroughly recommend his place. Show more"
30270339,Patou April 2022 This house is a paradise. The view on the sea is tremendous. What a pleasure to Wake up or be back relaxing with a drink looking at thé blue of sky and see  with the délicious sound of the gentle waves. There is everything we need here and palos is a great guest. Wonderfull.
30270339,Alan April 2022 Panagiotis (Panos) was there to great us on arrival. Explained everything and was very helpful. He also left us wine  fruit  coffee etc. This made the welcome feel very good.
30270339,Nico April 2022 Great House with a great view directly at the water. When you have a rental car you can reach a lot of great places within 30min. We will definetly come back in the hot months :)
30270339,Tasos October 2021 This is a real paradise! Beautiful house right on the Sea. Everything was very comfortable and perfect  There are lovely tavernas and walks  swimming right there  Highly recommended for a great vacation  thank you Panos!
30270339,Darek September 2021 Great place to stay away from the city! Clean cozy and very comfortable house . Everything you need to relax! Owner very very helpful and friendly! We will be back!!!
30270339,Diana August 2021 The house is equipped with everything you need. The view is stunning. The water is calm and warm in that area  it's such a pleasure to have a swim there. It was indeed the best stay on airbnb. Panos is a great host. Be sure to go to taverna Potamaki next door  you will love it.
30270339,Alex August 2021 Panagiotis place is true paradise  we couldn't believe our chance of being there. It's the best place we've rent on airbnb so far. Panagiotis is a beautifull person  full of attentions and really welcoming. He answered each of our messages very quickly  was on time  gave us informations on how to easily get to the house  was flexible with arrival time. He booked a taxi for us for when we had to leave. You can definitely count on him. House is more than clean  equiped with everything you could ever need. You'll have direct access to the sea  outdoor shower  sofas to sunbath  a large table to play cards  to enjoy local food  or some drinks watching sun going down. House has climatization in every room  it has laundry  coffee/tea machine  good wifi  bath  freezer  it has everything. The fish taverna next to the house is really good  plus it's really quiet so you'll never hear nothing from it. The owner is friendly too. You'll have the sea just for yourselves  it is cristal clear so don't forget your shoes  masks and tubas if you want to dive and see some amazing creatures. Don't hesitate one second  best place in Corfou  we recommand this house 1000%. Show more
30270339,Rob August 2021 Just perfect. Attention to detail  views  cleanliness  friendliness - 5 stars all round. Thank you  Panos.
30270339,Julia August 2021 Blue Horizon is the perfect  relaxing getaway. The house is clean and tidy throughout  with wonderfully comfortable beds and much appreciated air conditioning. We loved being right by the sea - you could simply go for a dip when you wanted. As noted in a previous post  sea shoes are a must and you should watch out for sea urchins. The water was beautifully clear and  in the hottest August for 40 years  it was like a bath in the shallows. Boukari is a peaceful  unspoilt place with a handful of traditional restaurants  serving lots of freshly caught fish  and a couple of small supermarkets - all within walking distance of Blue Horizon. We hired a car for our stay in Corfu and during our time at Blue Horizon visited the sandy beaches on the west coast  just 20 mins away. Again  a beautiful unspoilt stretch of coast although certainly busier than Boukari. If you’re looking for an ice cream parlour or cheap eats then I’d suggest a short drive (10 mins) up the coast to Messonghi - not the prettiest of places admittedly but it satisfied our teenagers demands for a gyros and an ice cream! All in all  a fabulous stay which I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a real escape from it all.
30270339,"Marta July 2021 This place is absolutely amazing! Panos is a great host - he was very warm and welcoming  his English is very good  the communication was smooth etc. He left us all kinds of things for breakfast and also a welcoming basket with a delicious wine and traditional sweets - we were pleasantly surprised and a bit sad that we didn't bring anything from our country to leave as a ""thank you"". The house is in the most wonderful location - we couldn't believe our luck to spend our evenings on the terrace and eat our breakfast with the sunrise over the mountains. Absolute heaven on earth! The house might not be newly renovated with IKEA furniture but that's what gives it character and it was spotlessly clean with the fluffiest towels! Don't forget to bring shoes to put on when going into the water as the coast is full of rocks and sea urchins. Also something against mosquito bites could be useful as I got bitten all over. But those are little things that don't really matter because this place is absolutely worth it!"
30270339,Maria July 2021 Panos house is the best place you can stay in Corfu Island! It has amazing view  attention to the detail and great hospitality! Bring with you padle board and any swimming things you enjoy  its located on the water. We are definitely coming back!
30270339,Susan June 2021 Lovely balcony and a simple house  wonderfully clean. Lots of taverna’s in easy walking distance. Pebbly beach access  bring water shoes  but oh so clean and beautiful in! Delightful.
30270339,Luiza May 2021 Loved it! I would go back in a heart beat!
30270339,Mariana October 2020 This place is heaven on earth. You have the whole house to yourself  which is located right on the water. The water is crystal clear and you can see for miles underneath. The sea is so calm and there are no other houses around so it feels like it is your own private pool. Panos and his family were lovely and accommodated us in a really welcoming manner. There were loads of welcome complimentary gifts which I’ve never had at an Airbnb before which made it feel really personal and cozy. The house is away from any big city so at night we could see all the stars and hear nothing but the waves. This place is simply amazing and I cannot wait to return!
30270339,Lucy October 2020 We had such an amazing time. Cannot highlight enough how beautiful swimming from the deck and sitting by the water is. It’s a quiet area with easily walkable local tavernas. We loved this location as it made it a perfect base to explore the rest of the island from. Would come back in a second!!
30270339,Claudia September 2020 We had a wonderful time at this beautiful little house  which is located right by the sea and even has its own private entrance to the water. Watching the sunsets from the Terrasse or even while swimming outside the house is absolutely incredible.  The house itself was spotless. It was nicely decorated and we even found some bottles of water  fruits and a little gift which Panos prepared for us. We felt welcome from the very first moment! Apart from that we received some valuable information about the house and the area when we first arrived. However we still had some questions during our stay  which Panos replied to instantly via text or/and phone. Thanks for that!  The house is located in a small village away from most tourists  so in general it is very quiet. However the bedroom window is right next to the street which did cause some noise during the night. Since the area is not busy  cars don’t drive by constantly  so it was completely fine. :)  We would highly recommend staying in this beautiful holiday home and would definitely book it again ourselves!!

30270339,Vincent August 2020 Fantastic place above the sea  with amazing equipments and attentions from Panagiotis. Our best stay with AirBnb until this day.
30270339,Ella August 2020 We had an amazing stay at Panos’s house by the sea. The view is stunning and the house was very clean and had everything you needed for a wonderful holiday. Would recommend bringing beach shoes to get in the water. Would also recommend Boukari spiros karidis for the best fresh fish! We hope to be back soon!
30270339,Simone August 2020 Panos's house is simply a piece of heaven! It is in an area away from traffic and the more touristy/crowdy areas despite having markets and restaurants at walking distance. The house was tidy & clean and equipped with everything necessary for a relaxing holiday and even more. The terrace is a real pearl: being able to access the crystal clear sea simply by going down a few steps is a must! Panos welcomed us personally explaining every detail and was always ready to give us advice and suggestions for a perfect stay.  Highly recommended!
30270339,Genevieve August 2020 Absolutely wonderful house at the sea. Everything was perfect inside the house and outside. Lot’s of generous and thoughtful touches in place to save you hassle! Just a lovely quiet place to spend days swimming  with great tavernas within walking distance. We even saw dolphins! Panos is fantastic our flight was late and he waited for us. The instructions for the house are clear and helpful and checkout was easy too.
30270339,Petr August 2019 Beautiful cozy house right on the water. In a rather quiet bay about 45 min south of Corfu town by car. Not too many tourists; a good fish taverna down the road; private water access great for snorkeling and swimming; terrace with a dining table and chairs for sunbathing. Hosts were quick to reply to messages and the house was clean and comfortable.
30270339,Bob July 2019 Idyllic setting. Spotlessly clean. Everything in excellent working order. Great WiFi appreciated by my 2 teenagers. Great fish Tavernas in walking distance  though car good for exploring. Recommend trip to Chlomos for view and eat at Balis Taverna. Thanks Panos
30270339,Ines July 2019 It was an amazing place. The view is great. It's perfect for holidays. It's so clean and beautiful. Thanks Pana for your hospitality ;)
30270339,Alice April 2019 We were a little reluctant to book as there were no reviews but we are so glad we did!!! This place was absolutely incredible. The sea was lapping right beside the terrace. It is in a special peaceful location and the perfect place to switch off. Panos and his wife were amazing hosts  leaving us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. They even provided some snacks and lovely touches. The accommodation has everything you would need for a great holiday. Even the neighbour is lovely! You can swim in the sea right there which was a little fresh in April but will soon be lovely as summer approaches! We hired a car and visited sandy beaches about 15 min away  all stunning. There are a lot of fabulous fish tavernas nearby and supermarkets with supplies if you want to cook for yourselves. We bought fish from the market a couple of times and it was super fresh and cheap. An amazing holiday. The locals are really friendly and relaxed. The setting is one of a kind. Absolutely gorgeous all day  particularly as the sun goes down. We will definitely be back if we're in Corfu again. Thank you! Response from Panagiotis May 2019 Dear Alice  thank you for you kind words. We were really glad to have you as guests in our house and happy that you had a pleasant stay with us and that we met your expectations. We are looking forward to welcome you once again on your next stay to Corfu island. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Show more
30270339,Markus October 2022 We can only agree with the reviews you've left so far. The organization  the house  the hospitality min as unbeatable as the location and the view...simply Blue Horizon!

30270339,Andreas Willi July 2022 It was a dream vacation in all respects With a dream accommodation!!! There was really nothing missing!!! Thank you for the wonderful time Piske family Translated from German  Show original
30270339,Anja May 2022 Fantastic location. You can really go from the terrace directly into shallow water with gravel underground. There are a few sea urchins but if you are a bit careful you can swim well in the bay. Top equipped  perfectly maintained house. Very dedicated host. Boukari has nice restaurants and little tourism. Driving to the north  however  is time consuming and strenuous due to traffic jams in Corfu city. You have to really get out early. But there is plenty to see in the south. And coming home is guaranteed to be relaxing. Translated from German  Show original
30270339,Mike October 2021 The house is very nice  how location is great. We could even spot dolphins. The host is very nice. We were very satisfied. Translated from German  Show original
30270339,"Markus September 2021 Actually  there is not much more to add - the house and especially the terrace is incomparably beautiful. Get up  open the door - this view is unique  everything is super clean. Coffee  tea  butter  honey  jam  nesspresso or filter coffee  everything is there for the first breakfast. Mosquito repellent  washing powder for the machine  TV with German channels  all rooms with extra air conditioning  everything available. We only missed egg cups and a ""normal"" toaster (but there is a sandwich toaster). The terrace sea side is in the shade almost all day. It was ok for us  as we like to visit different beaches. Sun worshippers can simply switch to the other side of the house  where you can get the full sun if you want. Unfortunately  the mopeds crack relatively loudly past the bedroom window at night. If you are a light sleeper you should sleep with earplugs. Bathing shoes are required  but this is very often the case on the south east side. Every now and then there are sea urchins  but since the water is crystal clear  you can see them immediately. It is therefore not suitable for children. The neighboring tavern Potamaki is super good  but is only open from August to September. Grandma and the daughters speak perfect German. The father was a guest worker in Germany from 1968 and the daughters were born and raised in Germany. The contact with Panos is absolutely straightforward  Panos speaks very good English. We really enjoyed it. Show more Translated from German  Show original"

The swimming spot at the house is stone with sea urchins  but no problem with shoes. there WERE a lot of mosquitoes  but all windows have nets.

30270339,Moni September 2019 The small cottage is located in the south-east of the island of Corfu. You drive about 45 minutes over small winding streets through smaller holiday villages from the airport. The cottage is located directly on the narrow road to the last small village with a small harbor  where there is a very tasty fish restaurant. Panos welcomed us in a very friendly way  even though he had to wait a long time for us and he fulfilled a wish. (Thank you very much!) If you enter the grounds via a garden gate  you can already look past Juccapalmen to the lake. This view is amazing! The house is well equipped with everything you need on vacation. Even a freezer is there. The terrace connects directly to the sea and quickly becomes home. The neighboring tavern is very quiet. The owners very friendly and warm. The food is delicious! The sea directly there is nice for swimming  but in some places to the right of the house Seeigel. 15 minutes away on the other side of the island is a long flat sandy beach. We really enjoyed our holiday here! Show more Translated from German  Show original
30270339,Олександр July 2019 Great place for family vacation. Very convenient practically its own beach. A cozy terrace with sunrise and sunset views  with the sound of the surf. A shop and taverns are within walking distance. For other trips you need a car. Translated from Russian  Show original
36879054,Carolina October 2022 Christo's accommodation is truly amazing! The apartment has literally everything you need for the perfect stay  from bathroom and beach towels to coffee machine  to toaster  to even a bottle of homemade wine and a tray to have breakfast in bed while you enjoy the beautiful view. I was never at an Airbnb so well equipped! The house is very beautiful and really clean and Christos and Tania were both lovely to us and ensured we had the best of the stays :D Petriti is a very small village but it's perfect to get away from more touristic areas and spend some relaxed days near the peaceful sea. There are two Mini markets next to the house and some restaurants less than 10 minutes walking distance. Thanks Christos  Tania and the rest of Petriti people for your hospitality! Would totally recommend this location :)))
36879054,Lucia August 2022 Everything was just perfect! ♥️
36879054,Veronika August 2022 House Kalithea is amazingly clean  beautiful and well situated on quiet fishing village Petriti. Recommended for anyone looking for calm experience in Corfu in a place not so crowded with tourists.
36879054,Pip July 2022 We had a wonderful time. We loved the appartment  its space  cleanliness and and its amazing views which inevitably meant climbing lots of steps! Christos and Tania are charming  helpful and generous with presents of wine  juice and water etc. Petriti is a welcoming and quiet village with excellent tavernas and beaches close to the appartment.
36879054,Katharine July 2022 A beautiful place to spend the week! The apartment is lovely and has excellent views out to sea. We enjoyed Marathias beach and Notos - both beautiful in different ways. Had a very relaxing time :)
36879054,Athanasia July 2022 The place was amazing and peaceful  exactly like the photos and really really well equipped ! 🤍
36879054,Anastasia June 2022 Beautiful place in a calm part of the island  would definitely come again!
36879054,Paul June 2022 We stayed here for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed this excellent apartment. It was very clean and well presented and the view from the terrace is fantastic. The hosts Cristos & Tania are very friendly and welcoming. We’ve stayed in many Airbnb rentals and this is among the best value for the high standards. We would definitely return and highly recommend.
36879054,Ruth May 2022 Stunning view & apartment. Lovely people. Petriti very quiet- suited us just fine  with just 2 tavernas early in the season.
36879054,Dalius April 2022 This is the place for complete calmness  silence and relaxation. No noise except some dogs barking  bells of church ringing. Super tidiness  not a single dust anywhere. Superb (!!) view. Maximum privacy.  There are several tavernas’ downhill. Several shops where you find all you forget to take with you. A bit further  15 minutes by car  there’s Lidl.  Very nice and helpful owners.  Plenty of parking place on the road. Very nice road from / to Corfu.  I would say - this is the best of the best. Would delivery go there once more.
36879054,Petra April 2022 A place to feel home with a beautiful view! Cristos and Tania took very good care of me after I felt sick. I was traveling in my own. I could’nt be in a better place. They also arranged my transportation from and to the airport. Definately book here
36879054,Fabienne October 2021 House Kalithea is a dream for travelers on Korfu. It was the cleanest apartment I’ve ever stayed in and the view is breathtaking. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen provided every tool you could ask for. Petriti itself is a small village  where you can buy your stuff at several supermarkets or you can just go for a restaurant at the sea. There a lot of beautiful restaurants by the sea  so you can be sure of a wonderful view while you’re eating! Our landlords were really friendly and we could always ask them for help if we needed anything.
36879054,Dan August 2021 Wonderful   lovely place for a couple ( or 2+1 ) 50 min drive south-east from Corfu town Kerkira   super-clean   modern styled  fantastic seaview  wonderful host Christos & family  don't miss the Notos beach and Petriti Port Tavernas
36879054,Aylin August 2021 Our stay at House Kalithea and Petriti in general was simply perfect. The view from the balcony was breathtaking  the apartment had everything we needed and the AC saved us at it was extraordinarily hot this summer. Petriti is a lovely little fishing village  not too crowded and touristy. There are lovely little taverna's right next to the ocean within a 5min walking distance from the apartment. Two little supermarkets where you can get anything you fancy and more are even closer. Petriti's beach is small but pretty  anyway I would recommend renting a scooter or car when staying on Corfu as there are so man other beautiful beaches and places to see that you can not reach within walking distance or by bus. We'd love to come back to the beautiful village and this comfortable  lovely apartment again one day and thank the lovely hosts for having us!
36879054,Michael July 2021 We had a fantastic time at this apartment! it is clean  the facilities are great  the view from the balcony is beautiful and the bed is amazingly soft! Add to this that the owners are extremely kind and helpful and you have an amazing Airbnb. 100% would recommend going here
36879054,Isaac July 2021 Brilliant stay & hosts. Made us feel so welcome & looked after everything we needed - car rental  good dinner spots  even fresh fruit and snacks. X

36879054,Ilka June 2021 We had a lovely time in Petriti  the apartment is very nice  spacious and clean and the view is just amazing! We really appreciated that the hosts greeted us nicely and left some homemade wine for us to try in the apartment  they are super kind people. Over all a perfect place to stay for a relaxing holiday :)
36879054,Erik June 2021 Our stay at Christo’s Apartment was absolutely perfect! The apartment was clean  spacious and offered everything we could have needed. The balcony with sea view is gorgeous! Petriti is a nice little fishing village with little tourists but some supermarkets and good restaurants. In the surrounding villages are additional great restaurants (we highly recommend „George&Elenas Tavern“ in Mesongi and „The Village Tavern“ in Moraitika). Christos and his wife welcomed us very warmly and were available for any questions. Thank you so much :)
36879054,Michael November 2020 This was really one of the nicest apartments I have stayed in. It is really tastefully decorated and has a fabulous view from the terrace of the sea and the Greek mainland. Additional touches are the smart tv and excellent broadband. Christos is a wonderful and attentive host and made us feel really welcome. The sea and excellent restaurants in walking distance.
36879054,Andreas October 2020 Everything was very OK !!
36879054,Sami August 2020 We had a wonderful stay at Christos' apartment ! The flat is really beautiful  and the view from the terrace is simply breathtaking. Everything was fine and Christos and his family are very nice. If we come back  we'll definitely book this bnb again !
36879054,Wesseree August 2020 Nice view from Balcony .. Christos is so generous ... easy check in and brought fruits   fresh eggs  wine in the fridge too. The house got a good style   good bed nice bathroom with good stones floor I loved that... in the end we has prolonged our stay longer.!!! Many thanks to Chistos and his family! I would recommend this place to everyone.
36879054,Filipp July 2020 Surprised by the cleanness  the view and the hospitality. We felt very comfortable and welcomed
36879054,Dima July 2020 Amazing hosts  dream location  thank you for everything!
36879054,Sue October 2019 Lovely friendly hosts  with a modern furnished top floor apartment overlooking the bay . Amazing views from the private terrace. Would recommend a car to travel around as it is in a quiet location.Walking distance to several tavernas  bars and supermarkets. You won’t be disappointed .
36879054,Chris September 2019 Kristos & Tatiania are great hosts  Kristos even met us from the bus and carried a suitcase up to the apartment. When we arrived at the apartment  there was a large bowl of fruit  home made wine and beer in the fridge  a lovely welcome. Perfect  Perfect Perfect  the photo's don't do the apartment justice. Light  airy  spacious  very modern  well decorated and everything you need for your stay. Fantastic views  you can lie in bed and watch the sunrise! We spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the fishing boats come and go. A short walk down the road where you will find 2 supermarkets and then a short stroll onto the working fishing harbour and the beach lined with tavernas/fish restaurants. There are sunbeds on the beach and plenty of places where you can fish which is what we did nearly everyday-sunbathing & fishing. Relaxing holiday in a quaint traditional Corfu fishing village where everybody says hello and smiles. Can't wait to return.
36879054,Karen September 2019 Tatiana and Kristos will make you feel so welcome and at home with little treats and always being available to help you with anything  it really is a beautiful quiet place i absolutely loved it and a view to die for  2 little supermarkets that sell everything a few tavernas on the water front and lovely quite tiny beach ...wonderful 💕
36879054,Laimonas September 2019 One of the best my Airbnb experience. Host was really helpful and understanding from check in to checkout. Apartment was sparking clean and with small and cute local gifts. Perfect location in Corfu for families and/or people  who wants calm and nice place with amazing view for morning cup of coffee or romantic glass of wine.
36879054,Francoise August 2019 Very beautiful sea view and very Nice hosts
36879054,Da July 2019 Christos and Tania turned our vacation in Corfu into a wonderful experience. We felt like at home. The apartment was very  very nice and clean with a great view to the beach and sea. All stuff for us and a small child/ baby was there. We have really nothing to critize and would recommend this apartment to everyone who does seek a place to stay in a small  silent and very friendly area (as this is what Petriti is in our eyes).
36879054,Solenne November 2022 We had a heavenly stay! This is clearly the best Airbnb we have rented: the hosts are kind and incredibly welcoming  the apartment is beautiful  clean and gives access to a magnificent view of the village and sea relief from the balcony terrace. In addition  it's a 2-min walk to two grocery stores and a 5-min walk to the sea and restaurants  it's super convenient to have a good time on this beautiful island! Thank you again to our hosts for their hospitality and availability  we hope to be back soon! 😊 Translated from French  Show original
36879054,Audrey September 2022 Tania and Christos are fabulous hosts. They were very careful for us. They are very friendly and welcoming people. Despite the language barrier  we were able to communicate easily  especially by message. The accommodation is of exceptional quality. Everything is perfect. Bedding. Amenities. Cleanliness and amazing views. A true change of scenery on this beautiful petriti bay. The accommodation is a 5-minute walk to great markets  restaurants and the beach. Petriti is a quiet town away from the tourist hustle and bustle. It is an ideal holiday place. We will come back in a heartbeat. This is a place we recommend without so much as a second thought. Translated from French  Show original
36879054,Johanna September 2022 We had a really wonderful week at the house Kalithea! The apartment is even more beautiful than in the pictures and especially the view from the balcony into the harbor is a dream. Right on the day of our arrival  we were greeted by the very warm hosts and received a bottle of our own family wine as a welcome gift.  Petriti itself is a cute and quiet little fishing village in the south of the island  which is not quite as touristy as other places. There are some tavernas right on the water and a private small beach. Both can be reached from the apartment within a 5-minute walk.  For excursions in the south of the island  Petriti offers a good starting point. We highly recommend especially the Arkoudilas Beach in the very south. However  if you also want to go all the way to the north  you have to take up to two hours drive. However  this did not bother us at all  as we love small road trips and you could discover so many different corners of the island.  We will definitely come back!

36879054,Anne Marie August 2022 Christos and Tania's apartment is very pleasant and functional: very nice decoration  comfortable and great view from the terrace. We enjoyed the calm  beach and restaurants of Petritis. The location is ideal for walking down to the beach  port and also to visit South Corfu. Small supermarkets nearby: everything was perfect! We would highly recommend. Translated from French  Show original

36879054,Chiara July 2022 We were received very nicely. As a welcome we were greeted with an in-house wine  cold water and juice.  The place is located a little higher than you can expect in the pictures. Nevertheless  you are in the small village of Petriti within a 5-minute walk to the port/beach. The sunrise is a dream. In the evening  when the sun sets in the back of the terrace  you have a magnificent view of the harbor.  The kitchen is superbly equipped  possibly a larger cutting board and a large knife  but that is criticism to a very high level - we were able to cook for ourselves several times without any problems! The bathroom with walk-in shower is a dream  as is the bed very comfortable and the view unique. The air conditioning works perfectly!  I'd love to come back! Translated from German  Show original

Greek hospitality.  ♥️🇬🇷 We will be back. 💯❗️ Translated from German  Show original
36879054,Oceane May 2022 What to expect - Wonderful hospitality from your hosts. People who are deeply kind and helpful. Little examples: 1) When we arrived at 11pm  all restaurants were closed. Ma'am naturally showed up to make us food.  2) Since the washing machine was broken  the lady came back to do our laundry with her machine.  3) We had to go on a trip to Paxos and Antipaxos by boat. Error with tickets purchased at the shop on site. Our host was there too. So he solved our problem with the saleswoman himself.  - An impeccable apartment. Everything is new  clean and simply beautiful (superb view). - A perfectly equipped apartment. (Microwave  washing machine  cooking utensils  etc.) - An apartment located in a beautiful small village  typical and quiet. 2 supermarkets a 2-minute walk away. A large road allowing easy parking without taking risks for the rental car. Everything is there. 100% recommend!! Thank you again and happy hosting.

36879054,Francois April 2022 Very nice apartment with a large balcony in a quiet area of Corfu. Our hosts were lovely and answered any questions we had. Great apartment for a couple. Very good restaurant by the sea: Limnopoulos. On the other hand  bring your sandals to go into the water because very few sandy beaches on the island Translated from French  Show original
36879054,Floraline April 2022 The accommodation is really very friendly with magnificent sea views. It's very nice to have breakfast on the terrace!

36879054,Franck August 2021 We had a wonderful week at petriti. The hosting of Christos and tania exceeded all our expectations. Two warm  caring  generous hosts (just like the people of the island) and concerned about our well-being throughout the stay until our departure. We warmly thank them and wish that this activity will continue and that many people will be able to have the same experience as us. Feel free to explore the island (especially in the north)  whether with friends  family or a couple  happiness is guaranteed. Translated from French  Show original
36879054,Beatrice Et Franck June 2021 We had a dream week at Christos and Tania's place. They are adorable and considerate hosts while being very discreet. The view from the terrace is sublime and it's pure happiness to relax there. The apartment is very well decorated and functional  everything is fine. It's bigger than it looks in the photos. Nearby you will find 2 supermarkets  small restaurants right on the water. For the beach we recommend notos beach just behind the petriti beach. It is reached by a very nice little path through the olive trees. The 2 tavernas next door have a magnificent view (taverna panorama). In short  it is ideal to spend a beautiful relaxing week....

23286746,Victoria October 2022 a real hidden gem on corfu island. cute area  old beautiful town  super sweet people living there. the kamaritis family was extremely welcoming  the room very clean. the view breathtaking! really recommend! we would come back anytime :)
23286746,Joy August 2022 Cosy place to stay with superb view from the pool. The family is very welcoming and hospitable. The animals were loved by our children who always went to play with them. Nikos and Maria are the perfect hosts. Little treats are put outside your room so every day there is a nice surprise. We were happy to feel part of Greek family traditions and enjoyed a meal with the extended family. Highly recommended.
23286746,Jamie June 2022 Just book it! If you need a quiet retreat on Corfu then this place is great. Beautiful surroundings in the mountains amongst the Cypresses  and the whole Kamaritis family are very kind and lovely and very welcoming. The food from the garden is also delicious  and Maria’s cooking is to die for.
23286746,Octavia May 2022 We stayed for two weeks here and we never wanted to leave! A fantastic place to stay in Corfu. Absolutely fabulous hosts  very welcoming and helpful and the accommodation was perfect. Very clean  easy access and we were made breakfast treats every morning! The location is perfect for visiting all parts of the island and it is incredibly peaceful and beautiful too. Stay here if you want a memorable holiday!! Thank you!
23286746,Els April 2022 Spotless clean  very comfortable cosy room. The welcome and stay was heartwarming. Every day Maria provided me with delicious snacks. Everything was perfect  also I loved the quiet location in the small town of Kamara. Bed was good  shower was good. Water  beer  youghurt and foods were in the fridge upon arrival. You need a car if you want to go around. Very much recommended!
23286746,Olalla September 2021 Wonderful place  wonderful people. We’ve been using with Airbnb for years  but this was our best experience so far. We already miss Maria’s suprise breakfasts. Thank you for the nice stay!
23286746,Brigitte September 2021 😂
23286746,Melanie August 2021 We had the most amazing time staying at Elenis place. It’s a beautiful place with a great pool area and the room is very clean and equipped with everything you could possibly need. The best part about our stay were the people though: Eleni  who is always available to answer questions and her parents who would make sure that we have everything we need. The daily snacks and breakfast surprises from Maria were the best! Highly recommend to stay there if you plan on coming to Corfu.
23286746,Lukas July 2021 Perfect Apartment for people who look for an affordable place right in the heart of the island. We rented a car for a week and the location of the apartment was perfect for exploring Corfu. The room was clean and equipped with all the necessities including an A/C. However  what made this place special was the host Eleni and her lovely parents. Everyday we were suprised with breakfast or fruits from the garden. Eleni was very responsive and gave us tips and recommendations when ever we asked her. Highly recommended!
23286746,Laura June 2021 We had the nicest time ever in Korfu and in the Villa Kamaritis! The hospitality of Eleni and her parents are unmatched  we really felt home. Maria provided us daily with delicious Greek treats  whenever we had the slightest issue Nicolas looked after how he might support us (+ provided us with fresh fruits from the garden :)). The whole family treated us so nice and heartwarmingly that it’s difficult to describe. We never felt to have not enough privacy and loved the ability to go for a run in the area or working out around and in the pool. Villa kamaritis is at a calm location and you really need a car to get around easily  but you should have a car in Korfu anyways. Also almost all kinds of equipment (such as a hairdryer etc.) are provided.  The only issue my boyfriend was with allergies  this is probably due to how green Korfu is  but the allergies were a bit stronger in our room.  Still we would recommend to stay at Kamaritis 100%  it really embodies what AirBnb is about as you get a „local“ experience.  So many things were positive that it’s difficult to mention them all  you have to just live it yourself. You can choose Kamaritis without minding a second time! Show more
23286746,Jakob September 2020 It was amazing! I just can recommend this loving place to everyone who wants to have a beautiful time on corfu. Thanks eleni + Family for this perfect time 🥰  Ps: rent a car! You need it 🙃
23286746,Mark August 2020 An absolute gem! We have had quite a lot of lovely Airbnb experiences but this is the very best of all! Quiet  tranquil location. Relaxing pool area  lovely hosts and little treats on a daily basis. Not always easy travelling with a single child but here she felt like part of an extended family. Aqualand nearby along with many lovely beaches!! We can’t wait to come back again in the future!
23286746,Katia July 2020 A home away from home 🏡 Kamaritis is a gem hidden in a tranquil cyprus hill  surrounded by lush  colorful flora  sounded by the sounds of birds and insects. It exudes such serenity and beauty — everything you need for a relaxing vacation. You can enjoy a morning swim or a night dip in the pool under the stars. The rest of the time you'll be busy exploring the myriad of awe-inspiring beaches on the west side of Corfu.  Me  my husband and son stayed for 7 days and had the most amazing time in Corfu. Eleni and her family contributed greatly to the experience. They are so hospitable  kind and friendly that you start feeling like extended family. My son became friends with the kids and they played every evening.  The fridge was loaded with surprises when we arrived and every morning we'd find a home-made hearty  delicious treat on the table outside the villa  including a fresh egg from the chickens in the garden. That really melted my heart.  The room was sparkling clean and the kitchenette loaded with everything you need to prepare tea/coffee and toast  boil eggs  or whatever else you need. There were 2 tables - one inside and one outside the villa. There was a fan and an air conditioner. But since it was pleasantly cool in the evening  we rarely used the AC. The large wardrobe to store our clothes was perfect. I was also happy to be able to use a foldable dryer in front of the villa. The bathroom was also very clean and charged with a soap dispenser  shampoo  shower gel  etc.  Overall  it was an extraordinary experience and we will definitely be back! I'd recommend Kamaritis to anyone who is looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay in Corfu. A home away from home 🏡 Show more
23286746,Roos July 2020 This is one of the best places we have booked via airbnb! The family is really welcoming and the place is just beautiful.
23286746,Kate Hoa September 2019 It is one of the best Airbnb experience that we have so far. We stayed for 9 days there and hope to be back one day.  The place is located in exclusive location in the middle of green forest but not so far from the airport or nicest beach. It is recommended to rent a car/ motorbike to the easy of going around. It is suitable if you want a relaxing environment free of tourists and convenience of access of beach/ town nearby.  The room  pool and everything else are clean and well-maintained. The garden with all different tree types are lovely to explore. There are also a playground for kids  2 cute cats and dogs living in the big garden which we enjoy the accompany.  Here comes the best part. Airbnb these days has become an industry which gets more and more similar to hotel one and slowly lose the “local experience” part. To live with a Greek family  have some nice chats with Nikolas  Maria and Eleni  learn something about Greek way of doing things in super warm-welcomed homie environment (while still enjoying our own privacy) is what makes our stay at Kamaritis very memorable. Thank you for the late salad  beers and water in the fridge on our arrival days  surprise little breakfast treat every morning  eggs and cactus fruits from the gardens  and your hospitality!

23286746,Michelle September 2019 I can highly recommend this airbnb! Eleni and her parents are such lovely people! We were welcomed warmy and felt directly like home as we saw our beautiful apartment. Everything looked pretty new and was furnished tastefully. The little kitchen was also very well equipped with everything you need. We even found eggs of their own chickens in the fridge. And the most important thing: Everthing was super clean  the room even smelled like fresh washed sheets! Another thing that I want to mention is that Elenis mother welcomed us with a delicious meal and suprised us with a little breakfast every morning. That was such a nice gesture that we really appreciated ❤️ We wished that we would have stayed longer  but we will come back for sure one day :)
23286746,Sergio August 2019 If you are reading this review trying to decide about you next stay... well don´t even hesitate and book it now! Me & my girlfriend travel regularly and often because of work and have visited tons of hotels and different places... we needed a place to disconnect. We could not be happier that we chose Kamaritis Villa for our holidays... -The house is amazing  the area  the pool  all very relaxing  more than a 5* hotel I promise...  the apartment is cozy and equipped with every little thing that you would think could be missing  done with love and attention to detail. - Location is perfect if you have a car or moto... the roads can be tricky but youll get used quickly as they are like this in the whole island ;) You can be pretty quickly in Corfu Town and many other beaches and areas  but it is also well apart from crowded touristic areas so the experience will be unique - The Hosts/Family: Evidently the highlight... we are a very private couple and used our holidays to reconnect  but even though we enjoyed all the privacy we wanted  we were very naturally drawn to the great personality of our hosts: Nikos always with a nice greeting  story or piece of fresh fruit (from their very own villa) and Maria... that gave us that complete HOME feeling by cooking the most amazing breakfasts and foods  surprising us every time with delicious treats and even wine... absolutely amazing people and it was a pleasure to share time with them whenever we could. Always with a smile  dedicated and helpful. Even the dogs are so nice and well trained that they wont even come close to the apartment or the pool area! Eleni was really helpful  efficient and sympatique. From the very fist step until the last day  everything was organized great  in a nice  simple and flexible way. She even took care of helping me with special requests due to my girlfriends birthday...everything was on point.  We are extremely grateful for our time there and will try to be back soon. Thanks for helping us have the perfect holidays! Show more
23286746,Renee August 2019 Guys stop searching for the best air bnb  because you allready found it here!  Kamaritis was the best place we’ve ever visited. Since the moment we arrived we felt at home because of the loving care of the family. They treated us like we where their family. Also; the food of maria is amazing and every morning she brought us some ‘suprise food’.  We definately come back at this place and wish you all the same good experiences as we had here(:  Stef and renee from holland
23286746,Niall August 2019 Very quite  super hospitable hosts and good base to explore the island.
23286746,Fabian July 2019 We had a great time here in Kamaritis!!  The family is soooo wonderful and patient. The house and the pool is a very good place to calm down and relax yourself.  I would strongly recommend Eleni‘s apartment to my friends and also to you guys.
23286746,Aleksandra July 2019 I am not sure where to begin. The family? The house? The surrounding area? Everything was incredible. Eleni and her family were so warm  welcoming and definitely made us feel at home and part of their family right away. We felt so spoiled. The house was spotless  very well equipped  with a very comfortable bed. It was very quiet and private. Their garden is so beautiful. Our room also had a private table out front where we could enjoy a coffee and soak in the morning beauty. I don't have words to describe how happy we were. We are planning on staying here next time we are visiting Corfu  if that says anything. I HIGHLY recommend this.
23286746,Maria July 2019 Best place to stay on Corfu island! The room was very cleaned  the location was great (close to the beaches and close to Corfu town)  the swimming pool was very relaxing and the area was full of trees. It was like in a paradise. Additionally  Eleni's family was so kind that they made our vacation much better. We have been in different Airbnb places  but they were the most hospitable and welcoming people that we had a chance to meet so far. We will definitely recommend it to our friends and hope that we can visit their house again.
23286746,Andrea July 2019 Eleni and her family  especially her parents  are outstanding hosts. I run three Airbnb rental places and am  myself  a super host. That said  if I am a super host  this family are super hosts on steroids. We have stayed at a number of Airbnb accommodations. This one excelled all others - including my own - many times over. When you arrive  you are overwhelmed by the beauty of the property and its quiet location with stunning views in all directions. We didn’t use the pool  but it was a very inviting setting ... a place we would have enjoyed if we weren’t so anxious to explore the amazing island of Corfu. A rental car is a must for doing that. Eleni recommended a very good place to rent a car ... and we found her rental car friend gave excellent service  too. Eleni’s Mother spoiled us with treats every morning  a couple of dishes the night we arrived and even a dinner one night when both parents cooked food largely from their garden. We felt so welcome there and could end up feeling like part of the family in no time. Truly  words fail to describe the totality of our experience at this uniquely special home away from home.
23286746,Carole June 2019 Where do I start with such a wonderful holiday. Eleni was fantastic from even before I booked until the minute I left. Travelling on my own  Eleni made me feel comfortable and welcomed. Maria and Nikos were also so helpful and friendly. Maria frequently appearing with a plate of food for me  home cooked and home grown. The area was amazing and so relaxing with a lovely pool. What a treat the whole holiday was. If you are looking for a negative. . . . you need to look somewhere else! Thank you all (including Paris)
23286746,Constanze June 2019 Nice apartment with everything you need in a quiet and small village next to Korfu town and Agios Gordios. If you want to relax in a peaceful surrounding you have to stay here. Elenis parents welcomed us warmly. Thanx for everything.
23286746,Steve May 2019 Our stay in Kamaratis was so much more than we expected  the house and grounds are amazing  Eleni and here family  especially her mum Maria and Dad Nikos are the most lovely of people  so welcoming and hospitable. We had a family meal with them on 2 occasions and its was amazing  Maria is such a good cook. The room is lovely and has everything you need. Our son who is 9 played with the 3 young children who also have a p;ay area with swings etc  so it'll be great for kids  also if you dont have kids  then they are very respectful if you just want peace and quiet. Kamaratis is in a lovely quaint village of Kamara  we walked through the village and spoke to a couple of people  they are so friendy. Its also in a great location  literally 30mins to the airport and about the same to the nearest beach. We will go back one day. You wont regret going here. Thanks again to everyone  we miss you. Response from Eleni June 2019 Thank you so much for your kind words Steven and Carmen. We really miss you and hope to see you soon again!
23286746,Jana May 2019 This was our second stay in Kamaritis. We can just relate to our recommendation from August 2018! Everything was perfect and it was as beautiful as our first stay. In the moment we arrived  we felt like coming home to our family. They cared very well for us  we spent a nice evening together and the time passed too fast again. We will definitely come back! Response from Eleni June 2019 Thank you Jana and Majo  not just for your kind words but also for coming back. We love you and can't wait to see you again soon!
23286746,Melanie September 2018 This was by far the most amazing airbnb experience we’ve ever had. Eleni and her family are the most generous and hospitable hosts you can imagine. Literally nothing was too much. Eleni helped us out renting a scooter  and picked us up from and brought as back to the airport. Eleni’s mother  Maria  makes the nicest pasteries and leave them on your table every single day. It was lovely to see Eleni’s father Nicos working in his own vegetable garden. Our stay ended with a delicious greek family diner  including the whole family. We’ll strongly recommend this airbnb and can’t thank Eleni  Maria and Nicos enough.
23286746,Milo September 2018 Staying at Eleni's place was a real treat!  The house is located in a small village some 10km away from the bustling town of Corfu. This is exactly what we were looking for since we were surrounded by beautiful scenery and the calmness of the surroundings. I do recommend to hire a car or a scooter for easier acces to the rest of the island. Eleni helped help us out with finding to right company to hire from.  Next to the amazing surroundings Eleni's family was equally amazing! Everybody was super friendly and always ready to assist us where needed. This must have been the first time that I felt completely at ease in someone else's home. This was also thanks to Nico & Maria  Eleni's parents  who made sure we were always content.  Also the communication with Eleni was always super fast and clear. This was hands down the best airbnb experience we've had.  Thank you very much! Show more
23286746,Bianca September 2018 Eleni’s home and hospitality have just been perfect! The home is very small but fully equipped and cured in any single details  the pool is just gorgeus (when you want to chill a bit you just need to open the door!). Each morning the grandma woke my family up with an home made meal  it was very cute! If you have a car you can easily reach the most beautiful beaches of Curfu pretty quickly. Eleni gave to my family a lot of info and made my family’s stay perfect! Many thanks!
23286746,Jana August 2018 We had a wonderful week in Elenis Apartment. Altough we arrived late at Kamaritis  we were warmly welcomed by the whole family with greek food and wine  cooked by Elenis mother Maria. But that´s not enough: During the whole week we were surprised by greek food again and again  something for breakfast or selfmade orange juice – it was just breathtaking how maria took care about us. When we came back to the apartment in the evening  we often sat together with Elenis parents and had some nice conversations. Whenever we liked to  we could spent time by our own  for example on the very clean pool on the beautiful estate or on the small terrace in front of our apartment. In general the house is secluded from the village  in the midst of forests  with many flowers and trees in its garden. In this quite place you can spent very relaxed vacations. Our room was very clean  lovely designed and cosy. We felt very comfortable here. You can find everything what you need for your holidays. Also the air conditioner and the fan did a good job. Already at our booking Eleni offered to organize a rent car for us. That‘s necessary to reach supermarkets and restaurants on the one hand but so many beautiful places on the other hand  which were recommended by Eleni and her parents. Because of the recommandations we found a lot of nice beaches  restaurants and attractions. In summary we can say  that we spent a perfect week in Kamaritis. We couldn‘t imagine a nicer apartment and host family. Even in hard times - we had an car accident - the whole family stood aside with all their help and supported us whereever they could  so we felt like a part of the family in this short time. They cared so heartwarming about us and they are all very lovely people. We can recommend this place wholeheartedly – we‘re sure  you can‘t find something better on Corfu!

Kisses from all of us!!
23286746,Joanna August 2018 We high recommend this accomodation! The hostes are very kind and hospitable. Especially Maria who treats us home-made dishes and goodies. We was feeling like the piece of the family. Despite of our weak English they were patient and helpful in communications. We spend wounderful time there in Kamaritis!
23286746,Federico August 2018 An incredible hospitality
23286746,Alexandre August 2018 Everything was perfect ! All the family is very kind  we enjoyed the great hospitality and the food ;) One of the best Airbnb experience ever.
23286746,Tomasz August 2018 SUPER SUPER SUPER  I had the pleasure of being a guest of Eleni and her family. I was with my wife and six-year-old daughter. For us it was a perfect holiday. The live room was even better than in the pictures. All very neat and clean. For the first time in arbinb the bathroom was so well cleaned and tidy. The kitchen  although not the largest  thanks to the tomatoes from the private cultivation of the hosts  we managed to make the tastiest pasta with tomatoes. The hosts every morning made us a surprise with delicious local desserts. The pool is exactly like the picture clean  well-kept and available round the clock. The owner extremely flexible  we arrived after 12 at night  they were waiting for us with a small dinner and small purchases in the fridge. We planned a one-time visit to Corfu but thanks to the warmth of the hosts  we are planning a vacation there next year. We wholeheartedly thank Eleni and her family for the warm welcome of a wonderful holiday.
23286746,Jack July 2018 Cannot recommend it enough! Firstly  the accomodation itself is lovely with all the things you need and very comfortable (the aircon is very welcome in the summer). The pool and outdoor areas are great also. The main reason to recommend it though is how welcoming and helpful Eleni and her family were. We were even invited to a barbecue with her family on the first night of our stay where we were made to feel very much at home. Also the food was the best we had on the holiday. Would definitely stay again.
23286746,Braňo July 2018 The best hospitable family I met :) . You will really enjoy your vacation at this place. Quiet  beautifull  everything there was perfect. I’m really recommending. :)
23286746,Clément July 2018 Kamaritis is simply the BEST Airbnb experience we have ever had!  The room  attached to the villa with a huge garden  was in perfect condition. It was comfortable and had everything we needed to ensure a wonderful holiday. The villa is located in a tranquil environment in the mountains surrounded by forest  where you immediately feel relaxed upon arrival. Contributing to this  is the amazing pool where you can cool down on warm days.  Concerning communication: Eleni was always very quick to respond to any questions we had – as was her family  whom we found particularly helpful and really hospitable  with good advice and recommendations.  We had the opportunity to share a few evenings around the fire with Eleni and her family  where we enjoyed some delicious traditional food.  We left Kamaritis feeling like we have family in Greece and would definitely recommend Kamaritis any day! Show more
23286746,Dennis July 2018 I was a pleasure to be Elenis' guests. We particularly enjoyed the nice pool and we made friends with the cute dogs and cats. The house is very clean and the view in stunning.
23286746,Michelle June 2018 We had a wonderful stay and Eleni and her family were so welcoming  helpful and hospitable. They went above and beyond to make our stay easy  enjoyable and comfortable and I can't recommend staying there enough. Absolutely beautiful location  gorgeous home and wonderful people. Thank you!
23286746,Sarah June 2018 Our holidays in corfu were amazing! Our stay in Elenis apartment was beautiful as well!! We enjoyed it very much and Elenis parents were so loving and warmly. We will certainly go back to Corfu and will gladly stay in Elenis apartment again :)
23286746,Rickward September 2022 We had a very nice time during our stay in Kamaratis. The location is wonderfully quiet and away from all tourism and yet is centrally located. We enjoyed all the delicacies from Maria. It was also a great experience to connect with local people. Translated from Dutch  Show original
23286746,Aneta September 2022 Dear Eleni  It was a really beautiful stay  the reception with the Greek salad and the wine is no longer to be topped! Simply brilliant! :-) The hospitality of everyone from the family was great  especially the little surprises daily for breakfast  make you feel like part of the family! Many thanks for this. The fact that we were allowed to stay so easily on the day of departure  helped us a lot and liked it  thank you very much for that! It was a pleasure to stay with you and if we are in Corfu again  we will certainly inquire with you whether we can be guests again! Best wishes to the whole Aneta & Josef family Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Vivien August 2022 We loved our stay! The house/surroundings looks like the pictures. All other details are correct. We didn't miss anything. We have rarely met such warm-hearted people! The house and pool are beautiful. Every morning there was a little something for breakfast always delicious and made with love! It smells so good of nature. The only sounds are the cicadas and crickets. It was perfect and we will miss the people and the property very much...! Translated from German  Show original

Eleni's parents' home is beautiful  as is the garden  pool  and outdoor kitchen. They are people of rare kindness and benevolence  one of our best AirBnb experts. A big thank you to you for everything  all your delicious breakfasts and other gifts. See you next year  I hope! ❤❤❤❤❤ Translated from French  Show original

23286746,Beatrice June 2022 Hosting Eleni's family makes you forget all the impersonal welcomes from some Airbnb's. Arriving late  Maria brought us a great welcome tray of Greek specialties. The rental is very clean  very pleasant  located in a pretty garden and equipped with a magnificent pool. The location is perfect for shining on the island. Quiet but close to everything. Maria is lovely and always smiling. She prepared us excellent and always varied breakfasts (€7/pers). Nikos and Spi are also adorable and always available to answer questions while remaining discreet. The only regret is that our poor proficiency in English limited our interactions. Go there without so much as a second thought. Translated from French  Show original
23286746,Sarah June 2022 Super great and incredibly beautiful. The whole stay was just great from the front to the back. Eleni's mother is a heartfelt host. She and her husband  Eleni herself and the whole family are so friendly and make the holiday very special. Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Laure June 2022 thanks to grandma Maria  Nikos and Eleni for hosting us. we stayed with our 3 year old son Leo  and everything was perfect.

Maria's kitchen is wonderful  with lots of fruit from the garden The house and the room are perfectly clean and very well maintained  Everything was perfect  thank you for your kindness  to be warmly recommended and we would love to come back to see you. hugs Laure Léo and Tony Translated from French  Show original
23286746,Hannah April 2022 Staying with Eleni's family exceeded all of our expectations! We never met Eleni herself  but her families are incredibly hospitable! The room is very cute and has a very well equipped small kitchenette and a small dining table with two chairs. There is also air conditioning. The terrace is very nice and has an awning  so you can sit outside in any weather. The property is very idyllic - there are dogs  cats and chickens - and is surrounded by olive groves. There is also a nice pool area. In about 10 minutes you are in Agios Gordios on the beach. For all questions  you could always address Eleni's father  Nikos  or write Eleni a message. Eleni's mother Maria is incredibly good at cooking and left us a Greek treat every day:) Overall  it was an incredibly relaxing stay with incredibly nice people! 🥰 We will definitely be back! Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Fabian September 2021 The place is really great!You have everything you needed and we also got something small to eat in the morning. Super hospitable and a beautiful pool! Can highly recommend the place and if we fly to Corfu again we will host this place again... Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Mélanie August 2021 Best Airbnb experience we've ever had - everything was perfect. Absolutely perfect. The welcome  the kindness  the small touches of Maria and Nikos  and the fantastic breakfasts : every day something new and 100% homemade. Thank you also for all the attention to our future baby. Looking forward to returning one day with her to this little piece of paradise. Thanks again for making this holiday perfect and unforgettable - we felt right at home.

23286746,Cédric August 2021 We had a lovely week in Kamaritis. The villa is in a very quiet and beautiful setting  in the countryside and it is very well located : 15 minutes to get to the city of Corfu and we were able to travel easily to the island. The family is very welcoming and attentive : excellent homemade products offered each morning by Maria  snacks by the large and beautiful pool. Great place to relax. It was our first AirBnB  and it was a very nice experience  which allowed us to connect with a lovely Greek family and get to know the Greeks better. Thanks so much to the family for their hospitality ! Translated from French  Show original
23286746,Dimitris July 2021 Great surroundings great people  impeccable hospitality. Thank you very much. Translated from Greek  Show original
23286746,Marian September 2020 A little paradise! Had a great short break in Kamara in Kamaritis. Reception very warmly and what a pleasure to find freshly mowed delicacies of Maria every day. The art of giving and sharing is a second nature with these sweet people while on the other hand being given all privacy. Wonderful pool  often for me alone. You can hear chickens  the rooster  sheep/goats and the dog sometimes barks  but that mostly made me feel safe. The love of everything is visible  noticeable  and palpable. House is nicely decorated with an eye for details. Everything is available. From iron to kettle  hairdryer  first aid kit  etc.  etc. Really super organized. Upon arrival you will also find some tasty and necessary things in the fridge. A place to feel at home very quickly. ❤️ You will find peace and an atmosphere where nothing is necessary and a lot is allowed (to eat with). I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to keep the place to myself  I knew honestly. I'm sure you'll go back there with my kids or friends. For car rental book at Rollandos rent a car. Top service  personal  reliable and great car clean and complete. Translated from Dutch  Show original
23286746,Thomas August 2020 We had a perfect stay at Eleni's place! The whole family is super nice and helpful! Maria's food was a dream! Absolutely recommended place to stay! Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Kuba August 2020 The place is made of people. It would be beautiful without Elena's family. The hospitality  the heart of the host  and the warmth they've welcomed us with each day made our vacation even better. The whole family welcomed us as a family  leaving us plenty of space for privacy. A dream vacation. Beautiful and clean room with a pool  daily snacks for breakfast  and a smile all the time. It's a place where we had everything we needed. If we're back in the Coronavirus and I think we'll do it sooner or later  I can't believe we're looking for another place to stay. Great for family vacations.  Thank you for a wonderful rest!   Σας ευχαριστώ για την υπέροχη στιγμή! Translated from Polish  Show original
23286746,Dafni July 2020 It was a very nice stay. Eleni is an enchanting host. So are their parents. Every day there was a little something (cake  etc.) from the sweet mom Maria  which she put in front of the room for us in the morning. All the residents of the house are very warm and welcome you like family. The room was great. There was nothing you missed. On arrival we were warmly welcomed by you with delicious cold Greek. Honey & cold juice. Our daughter jumped right into the beautiful pool which was a great change from the ocean. Thank you very much for making the 5 days in Corfu very special. The tranquility up here is simply fantastic & heavenly. Regards  Dafni & Family Translated from German  Show original
23286746,Margherita September 2019 We stayed at Eleni's for 5 days  what can I say! Simply amazing! Exceptional cleanliness  super cozy and super cute! There are all the essentials for a dinner or lunch! Same as the photos! Every morning we received an exquisite dessert from Maria! It felt like home!If you go back to Corfu I would not choose another place! If you can just go for a weekend  do it! Thank you Maria  Eleni and Nikos! Translated from Italian  Show original
23286746,Ariane September 2019 Wonderful stay at Eleni's despite the only night spent in this airbnb! Everything was absolutely perfect: Eleni went above and beyond to help me arrange our complicated travel as we arrived from Paxos for just one night in Corfu before flying back the next day. She called a car rental agency for us to help us find the best price.  She was waiting for us when we arrived around 2 p.m. with a tray of a Greek salad cooked by her mother: the best we ate on the island! In short  super touching attention. The room was perfect  impeccably clean and with everything you need: towels and beach towels  cooking essentials  samples of products in the bathroom  tourist documents on the island...It is really separated from the rest of the house so you feel completely independent. For 7 euros per person  Eleni's mom had made us gargantuan and delicious breakfasts that we enjoyed by the pool before returning to our plane.  Finally  the house is located in a small mountain village 20 minutes from Corfu which is quite picturesque and very quiet  far from the important tourist hustle and bustle of the island's coastlines. Very rejuvenating! Agios Gordios beach is just a 10-15 minute drive away. Show more Translated from French  Show original
23286746,Patritsia July 2018 Helen and her family have created a nature paradise they share generously with their guests. The room is very beautiful  with a ton of amenities (shampoo  body cream  first aid items  pool towels  table cloths  oil/vinegar)  the garden inside the greater forest of the area  as well as the swimming pool made with love. But the most important thing is the smiles and hospitality they gave us: what spoon sweets  what liqueur kumquat  what homemade cakes  garden figs  pancakes  etc. - everything was given to us with love and care! You brightened the holidays  making us part of your paradise and that's priceless!!! We can't thank you enough!!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
23286746,Lucile May 2018 We spent three nights at Eleni's and her family's and were wonderfully welcomed. The village is very quiet and ideally located in the center of the island.

21880470,Francois July 2022 very nice place to stay with superb view Response from Anna July 2022 Thank you Mr Heroux. You and your family  are always welcome!
21880470,Johanna October 2021 The views from the house were outstanding - we could watch the sunrise and sunset over the sea. The house is really luxurious  with lovely grounds to explore. We all slept well. All the bedrooms have air conditioning if needed  and the beds are really comfy. Everything was spotlessly clean. The kids loved playing in the pool  climbing the olive trees  the swing seat and bean bags and Netflix. WiFi was good. Anna and George are really kind lovely people and went above and beyond to help  leaving toys for the children and local foods for us to try and advising on places to visits and restaurants. We had a lovely lunch at Dolce in Lakones and a boat trip from Paleokastritsa. The archeological museum in Corfu city was great  with a pediment from the temple of Artemis depicting the gorgon Medusa. The beach at Agios Gordios is long and Sandy  great for swimming and plenty of restaurants. What a wonderful trip! Thank you!
21880470,Tina October 2021 Anna's place  Villa Vardia  is one of the best places you will ever stay. Firstly  we were met by George (Anna's husband) who guided us to the Villa  as it is up quite a bumpy track. Then Anna and George gave us a very helpful tour of the house and things to help us enjoy our stay. Anna had left us some fresh fruit and prosecco  which was so thoughtful. The view from the villa is breathtaking and the sunsets and sunrise were so incredible. The villa is very well equipped with everything you might need. I have never met such great hosts. Anna and George were so accommodating and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always there if we needed them. Anna even baked my daughter and I a traditional greek cake  which was delicious! We couldn't recommend Villa Vardia any more highly and are planning to come back when we can. Thanks so much again Anna and George. Response from Anna October 2021 You were also lovely ladies  very kind and warm  who respected this property as their own home. I would be more than happy to see you again.
21880470,Lars July 2021 We had a grat stay at Annas house! Everything was clean and we were welcomed with some fresh fruit and a bottle of Prosecco. The view from the villa was spectacular and it was peaceful and quiet - we felt that we had the whole area for ourselves. Anna was very helpful and easy to communicate with. We can without hesitation recommend Villa Vardia - we spent an unforgettable week in the house and hope to come back at some point!
21880470,Conor November 2020 The Villa has one of the best views in Corfu and it was lovely to sit watching the sunset on the horizon every evening. Communication with the host was exceptionally efficient and she went way above and beyond what was expected to make us comfortable. I would highly recommend Anna's place to anyone looking for a relaxing getaway.
21880470,Christopher October 2020 We had an amazing week staying at Villa Vardia! It was sparkling clean  and the views are some of the best that we have ever had - so much so that we spent more time than we had planned at the villa than on the beach  as it was such a great space to spend time. Apart from the views  the privacy is outstanding - no-one overlooks the villa! Incredibly peaceful and quiet.  Anna was a fantastic host  meeting us and talking through how everything worked (it is her house  so we wanted to make sure we looked after everything). Little touches like having a bottle of prosecco  fruit and milk/water on arrival were appreciated  as well as other things. Communication was spot on and she had loads of recommendations for us. Kitchen was well equipped with some spices  sugar  oil etc.  Overall  a simply perfect stay and we would stay here again  should we return to Corfu.  Hints for guests: - The road up is a bit bumpy  so maybe hire a car with some good clearance - Buy lots of bottled water beforehand. Also mosquito repellent. Like anywhere on the island  wasps can be a nuisance. Show more
21880470,Danielle October 2020 Really beautiful property and stunning view! Anna is very attentive and a very kind and flexible host. The house was spotlessly clean. I highly recommend staying here!
21880470,Giorgio August 2020 Villa Vardia is an amazing place in the middle of Corfu. The view is just astonishing  a dream come true waking up with such a view!

21880470,Krystian September 2019 Villa is placed in a great place  we spend four days in a beautiful area - also got engaged there ;) Anna is super helpful  and we will come back to Villa when we are able to get some free week. One of greatest Airbnb picks.
21880470,Colin July 2018 Anna was a perfect host  worked very hard to make sure we had everything we needed. Cleaned the new pool every morning and provided clean towels and bed linen every 3 days. The Villa was spotlessly clean  spacious and well maintained with amazing views. Highly recommend. Response from Anna August 2018 Thanks so much for being perfect guests! I hope to see you again!
21880470,John July 2018 We had a wonderful week in Anna’s beautiful home. The views are incredible! And it is so peaceful. The outside area is perfect- a large shady area to eat with the amazing views  a new  small swimming pool which is lovely to cool down in  walks straight from the door  plenty of garden around the house. The last bit of road to the house is a rough stoney track  narrow and steep in places. Difficult to pass another car but it’s a very quiet road so this happens rarely. It’s worth the drive as the views are truely amazing! Anna is a very attentive and welcoming host. This is her family home ( she lives in the local village in the summer) and we saw her daily . She was very helpful  providing extra things we needed  arranging activities for us and giving useful local information. We walked down to the village to buy bread; there are a few basic food shops there too. Good beaches a short drive away. Good position on the island for sightseeing. We would happily return someday! Thank you so much Anna! Response from Anna August 2018 Thanks so much! You were wonderful guests!
21880470,Birgit October 2022 It was a fantastic vacation in a great villa. It is tastefully decorated. If you are looking for peace and relaxation  this is the place to be! The owner Anna was very warm and always available for one!! Translated from German  Show original

There were a couple of things we needed help with and Vicky saw to them immediately! We will definitely be returning  thank you SO much!! David & Julie
12058990,Ally September 2022 A super Villa  clean  comfortable  spacious and well equipped. The pool  BBQ terrace and wonderful view were beyond our expectations and trips to lovely beaches and Corfu town were easy and memorable. We’ll certainly be back. Highly recommended.
12058990,Menna August 2022 We had a wonderful stay at villa verde  beautiful villa  stunning views and an amazing outdoor bbq area and pool. Two families with kids aged from 3 months to 19 and we all loved it. Vicky was so friendly and helpful  highly recommend!
12058990,Rob August 2022 A great villa  enough space for 2 families. Vicky  the host  was attentive and met us at the villa in the early hours of the morning after a very late delayed flight. The views  pool  outdoor kitchen and choice of terraces are incredible. Recommended.
12058990,Mathilde July 2022 A real gem! We were two families of nine people who stayed for two weeks in Vicky’s lovely villa. The view is fantastic both front and back of the house  the pool is clean  fresh and nice. The bbq  hammock and big dinner table on the backside was used every day. All bedrooms were big and with air-condion. The kitchen had everything we needed. The house were cleaned two times during our stay and when we left. The pool was looked after several times. Vicky was a great host and cared so well for us. We hope to come back soon!
12058990,Tatjana June 2022 Central location on the island. Great place for family and friends gatherings and relaxing. Multiple covered patios  well equipped kitchen and absolutely amazing infinity pool! The views from the Villa Verge were stunning! The host Vicky was very attentive and personable. Highly recommend Villa Verde!
12058990,Kath October 2021 Villa Verde is a wonderfully luxurious holiday stay and well worth checking out. We travelled as two families and there was plenty of room for all of us  3 double bedrooms and also a bedroom with bunkbeds and 2 single beds so the children could all share. The kitchen was so well stocked with everything you could need and opens onto balconies and verandahs overlooking Corfu harbour. The absolute highlight though was definitely the pool  with its infinity outlook across the harbour; it even changes colour at night. The hosts even provided towels to lighten the packing. The road up to the villa is a bit pot holed in places  but its well worth it. The nearest supermarket is about 10 minutes drive away and has everything you could need.
12058990,Geneviève September 2021 We enjoyed every moment of our stay at Villa Verde. The villa is conveniently located and is very well equipped. The view of the different terraces is amazing. The communication with Vicky and Elena was very easy.
12058990,Ognian August 2021 Great villa  great view to the island and the Kerkyra port  very well equipped kitchen  comfortable lounge  all bedrooms with AC. The pool is very good for all ages. The location was perfect  away from all traffic and noise and the same time close to the port and the airport. Vicky is a kind and welcoming host; she was very repsonsive  always ready to help with the couple of really minor issues we had. Thank you Vicky for the great time we spent in Villa Verde!
12058990,Ciaran August 2021 Stunning Villa! Was perfect for our family. Great location  had everything we needed and Vicky was a wonderful host.
12058990,Sally July 2019 An excellent base from which to explore Corfu. The Villa was lovely and had the most beautiful view. Vicky is a fabulous host  who could not do enough to ensure our stay was the best it could be. Thank you Vicky!! Also worth a mention is the lovely taverna 10 mins down the road  lovely team of staff and gorgeous food and wine.
12058990,Stefan June 2019 Best view on Corfu :-)
12058990,Tal&Liat June 2019 We are a party of five (parents plus 3 teen aged kids) and spent 5 marvelous days at this villa. The first thing you notice after landing and collecting the car  is that it is located just 10 minutes of lazy driving from midtown. The second impression is Vicy the owner who was standing outside of the villa waving hello although not knowing of our exact arrival time. At the end of the vacation she became a dear friend and a valuable host. The villa is great- sparkling clean  big enough for persons and small enough to feel cozy. Close enough for a quick jump to the nearest caffe (Try emerald !) Or lidl supermarkets  yet far away from the city to wake at the morning only from the birds singing. Interior is equipped enough to assure all your needs  yet you will spend most of the time at the amazing pool\ barbeque and all other possibilities its outsides offer. To sum things up: Visiting in corfu? Villa verde is the place to stay  hands down...
12058990,Rachel May 2019 Highly recommend!! Vicky is the perfect host and the villa is outstanding. We were a large group of friends coming to Corfu for a friends wedding and the villa was absolutely perfect. There is tonnes of space  lots of different outdoor areas to relax  including loungers and comfy rattan style sofas and table to recline and enjoy by the pool. There is a large bbq with all the necessary equipment. There is a taverna within walking distance which we highly recommend. Very cheap  extremely tasty and brilliant hospitality. We hired a car based on Vicky's and previous guests recommndations and would advise the same. It made trips to the supermarket and local sites much easier. The villa is quite remote but the views are incredible and the whole place is very serene. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a stay on the beautiful island of Corfu.
12058990,Niek October 2018 Very nice and roomy villa  both indoors and outdoors. Great view and privacy  lovely pool (not heated). The pictures give a very good impression of what to expect.
12058990,Wouter October 2018 We had a wonderfull time. The house is great and the view is amazing. We had the best times at the BBQ area overlooking the bay. The owner is very helpfull and ordered food for us the first day since we arrived late and let us check out late.
12058990,Kathy September 2018 Villa Verde is highly recommended!  Our group of four friends had a wonderful week at this fantastic  spacious  peaceful and well-equipped villa.  The glorious infinity pool  variety of gorgeous outdoor terraces  excellent BBQ area  and stunning views really make this villa something special.  Vicky was a brilliant host. Pre-trip communication was excellent and replies were always prompt. During our stay Vicky was attentive  warm and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. She was always on hand but was never intrusive. She kindly picked up some of our group upon arrival to Corfu and also provided us with bottled water to get started.  Everything in and around the villa has been done to a very high standard and is well maintained. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need and more. There are multiple indoor and outdoor dining/seating areas  you really are spolit for choice! All four bedrooms have air conditioning. There is a separate utility area with washing machine. There is also a long driveway within the grounds of the villa and behind secure front gates.  The villa was spotless and there was a mid-week clean and change of linens/towels. The pool was also cleaned twice during our stay  which was unexpected but lovely!  As other reviews have noted  a car really is necessary. However  there is a lovely new local taverna only a 10-minute walk from the villa  which we would definitely recommend too! Show more
12058990,Andreas August 2018 Villa Verde is fantastic with a breathtaking over corfu. The villa is very commodious and well equipped. The pool and BBQ is amazing. Villa Verde is highly recommanded.
12058990,Giacomo July 2018  excellent location  well-kept and elegant villa  equipped with everything you need. I warmly reccomend it (ps. bring the insecticide)
12058990,Joanna June 2018 Great place for a family vacation!
12058990,Anna September 2017 It was wonderfull time in beautifull house with great view from terrace and with big shadow from olive tree. Place where house is located is very peaceful with lot of olive tree and other plants. The house is big  with spatial common space with open big kitchen. Everything was worked what is very important when you are on holidays ;)). Vicky was very helpful and cooperative  she picked up us from the airport and she gave us a lot of advices.
12058990,Enrico August 2017 We were 2 families (7 persons) and we had the great opportunity to spend 10 days in Villa Verde  the nicest and coziest house in Poulades! First of all a special thanks to Vicky. A perfect host  always available (she lives nearby) and ready to help us for anything ( she also came to pick us up at the port). Vicky was so nice and warm with us. Second the house: nothing to add to the other comments. The house is very big and cool as you can see from the pictures. The rooms are spacious and air-conditioned  the kitchen is fully-equipped  the yard is huge with a nice table and a great barbecue you can use and there's wifi all over the property. When we arrived it was perfectly clean and tidy. A cleaning service was organized during the stay. It's situated in a strategic position on the hills (Poulades) so you will need a vehicle to move and reach the most beatiful beaches of Corfu.
12058990,Fabio July 2017 Last week I stayed in Villa Verde with 7 friends of mine (all aged 19) and we enjoyed the holiday a lot. The house is very big and cool as you can see from the pictures. The rooms are spacious and air-conditioned  the kitchen is fully-equipped  the yard is huge with a nice table and a great barbecue you can use and there's wifi all over the property. When we arrived it was perfectly clean and tidy. It's situated in a little village on the hills (Poulades) so you will need a vehicle to move; a car is probably the best choice but  since in Corfu they don't hire cars to people under 21  we rented four scooters (50cc) and we were perfectly fine. The streets are a little steep and narrow but we managed to move with no big problems. Just a little tip: try to keep to the main ones. The nearest supermarket (Diellas) and shops are about 3.5 km away and you will find anything essential. However  I'd suggest reaching the AB market in Kontokali (1.5 km further towards Corfu Town) to do your main shopping because it's better-stocked. Regarding the beaches  we visited Paleokastritsa (very beautiful)  Dassia (nice and close)  Ipsos and Kontokali (close but not the best). Make sure to pay a visit to Corfu Town  it's not far but really cute. About night life  we've just been to Ipsos which is very touristic and full of Italian people but close and not bad. Vicky  the owner  was very nice and warm. She called for our taxis every time we needed one  helped us rent our scooters  brought our bottled water up the hill  kept our luggage during the last day after we had left the house etc. She was always available on the phone  plus she used to drop in on alternate days to water the plants and lives nearby so you can talk to her whenever you need to. If I decided to visit Corfu again with many other people  I'd most probably choose this house. Show more
12058990,Sandra June 2017 Thank you very much!!! Me and my friends were very delighted to have the chance of meeting Vicky and living in her beautiful house in Corfu.This was the best accommodations I've ever experienced.It was much more than we expected. The house is nicer and cozier in real life than in photos. It's very spacious and clean. You have everything you need at your disposal  plus an amazing view and big balconies and garden. I enjoyed our nights stay and the only thing we would change is having stay longer! Beautiful decor  stunning views and great atmosphere all around  15 minutes drive from Corfu town. Vicky and Thomas who look after us during our stay were helpful for anything we needed  and very kind. they took us from the Port/Airport and They are lovely people  willing to help with anything needed. The pictures do not show how luxury and well equipped is the house. The house is bigger than what is illustrated. Location is great  but you have to be with a car/rental or own/. Big store is 5 min with car. House is in the middle of the island  so it is convenient to visit all famous beaches. Dassia and Paleokastritsa beaches are near. Perfect for a group trip 8 people. The house has an amazing terrace with big table and excellent BBQ. I recommend to all. This exceeded my expectations. Thank you Vicky see you again next year!!! Show more

12058990,Oliver October 2019 We stayed at Villa Verde with 3 adults and 4 children. The house is large  the swing is huge and beautiful with its olive trees and the various possibilities to stay (lounge by the pool  terrace with large table  patio with barbecue and giant table). The view and the pool are amazing. In 15 minutes you can reach beautiful beaches. Vicky is a great host and was always available to us. We can recommend the place with a clear conscience!

We really enjoyed having them at Villa Verde and we hope they had a great time staying here as well! We hope to see them again soon . Thank you Oliver !

42379262,Anna December 2022 We had a great stay for two nights in December at Leonidas apartment - even though there was a storm going on  we always had warm water  power  internet and running central heating. It was warm and cosy. The apartment is well equipped with everything you need and super clean. The view is great  short walk to the Tavern and great hiking trails. Leonidas is a very caring host  communication is very easy. Highly recommended this place.
42379262,Esther October 2022 We really enjoyed our stay in the apartment. The location was perfect. It felt secluded and unique  and the view was exceptional! The fact that the path into the mountains was basically in the backyard was just stunning. The apartment itself was 100% clean and comfortable. We liked the authentic aesthetic. Plenty of information was given about the apartment and the surroundings. Thanks again for having us!!
42379262,Jennifer September 2022 I absolutely loved my stay at Leonidas’s property. Leonidas was a perfect host providing excellent communication  a friendly welcome  and a beautiful  clean  well-supplied accommodation. My dogs were welcomed and the fenced property was perfect. It was quite a drive up the mountain with beautiful scenery and nature. I highly recommend staying here for a quiet  peaceful getaway!
42379262,Bartłomiej September 2022 The place is lovely and quiet  view is amazing and the host is great. Totally recommend. Our flight was delayed but Leonidas waited for us and greeted us with a smile
42379262,Daiga September 2022 Best place to spend holidays at Corfu! We were at Pantokraror Sunside Studio 7 days  me and my husband enjoyed full time. Leonidas is best host  he met us with home products  we had everything we would need. Best views  wonderful sunsets every day. This was our best choice!
42379262,Pablo September 2022 Leonidas’ place is simply magical and Leonidas himself is the definition of a super host and a very  very kind person. We arrived late for the check in but he waited for us patiently and even greeted us with wine  oil and eggs! He also gave us great recommendations on what to see on the island. His place was super clean and he has taken care of it and put a lot of thought and detail into it - it felt like home right from the start. Not to mention the outdoor area which was simply perfect beautiful big garden with two hammocks; delicious fig tree and a gorgeous view on all the mountain and sea which is even better at sunset. It is difficult to get there by foot as it is at the top of a mountain  but if you have a car or a motorbike I 100% recommend. If we come back to Corfu we will definitely stay here and for longer than this time.
42379262,Jana September 2022 This was our third time at Leonidas‘ wonderful studio and it was perfect as always! We will always come back ‘home‘ again. Everything as described and on the pictures.
42379262,Cristina August 2022 Excelent condition. the fig tree it was delicious!
42379262,Izabela August 2022 Great host  a special studio in an authentic village  away from crowds. The studio has all you need  Leonidas' attention to small details is amazing. The communication is easy  friendly and welcoming. The check in and out - efficient. The place is quiet  the view is great - sunsets are amazing. The village has 2 restaurants and another one is in the nearby village. Very close to the peak of Corfu.
42379262,Dominik July 2022 Super Host is a fitting label! Friendliness is an understatement. He really cares. The house is situated away from the mass tourist areas. In a small pitoresque town that is worth a visit on its own  there is also a really good tavern right down the street  thats also a good tip if you decide to stay somewhere else. The sight of the sunset on the frontporch is probably the best you will get even if you would look for the perfect spot elsewhere. The quiteness in the morning and in the evening is a blessing after action loaded days on the road and beach. The house seems remote but it's actually well positioned if you want to explore everything the north has to offer. You need a vehicle of course  but thats in my opinion a must anyways on corfu. From the top of the mountain you can easily venture out in every direction. Mountain driving will be a daily task (anyways even if you stay at the coast). It was the perfect choice for us. We would come back for sure.
42379262,Kirsten July 2022 Leonidas’ house is the best place to stay on Corfu; the studio  the location  the nature  the quietness  the village (with a very good restaurant) - we loved it. The house has everything you need and more (eggs  wine and vegetables from the surrounding garden). We’re sorry we only stayed for one night. Will definately come back!!!
42379262,Eleanor July 2022 My husband and I had an absolutely amazing stay at Sunside Studio!! Very well-equipped with all the basics  and so clean and tidy. Leonidas was very kind and helpful  staying up late to meet us for check-in after our flight was delayed  and then sent a couple of messages throughout our stay just to see if we needed anything!  This place really lived up to its name  we sat and watched the most beautiful sunsets every evening  such a stunning view! Lovely rural location; with it being a small island we were able to explore a lot with our hire car  but enjoyed returning to the peace and quiet of the studio.  We had a perfect stay  it was mine and my husband's first holiday abroad together (celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary!) and since Leonidas has put so much care into making this a wonderful place  we couldn't have hoped for a more lovely time!
42379262,Tobias June 2022 If your are looking for peace and quiet  this is the spot. The town has two lovely tavernas  about five minutes by foot. Up there  in the studio  you are far away from everything. You can look out over the island and the Ionian Sea. If you need luxury  go somewhere else. If you appreaciate simplicity  with a strong dose of personal thought and caring details  Leonidas' is your host and his studio is for you.
42379262,Dinas June 2022 If you are looking for absolute tranquility  slow rythm  nature sounds  perfect views (especialy sunsets)  friendly neighborhood - this is the place! Dont forget to visit local taverna Oasis ! Leonidas is a 100% Superhost - meets like you are family member  and gift basket of local goods was more than we could expect !
42379262,Steffen June 2022 The studio is really amazing for those who want to enjoy the sunset and the nature. I really recommend this option. Leonidas is a very kind host and is available for any help or advice you could need. Thank you Leonidas !
42379262,Amelia May 2022 A wonderful experience in a very special place with a very special host. This felt like coming home. Incredible beauty  nature  peace and quiet. Very very special. And the care that Leonides takes of his guests is also very special. Corfiot hospitality at its best.
42379262,Selmer May 2022 Leonidas was a great and attentive host.
42379262,Kristina May 2022 It was absolutely wonderful stay! Leonidas is a fantastick host and the place is really unique. If you you are not a fan of the touristic enterntaiments and crowded places and just want to enjoy the peace or feel the vibe of small Corfu villages you must stay here.
42379262,Jeff April 2022 Leonidas may not be the King of the Spartans (reference the film “300”) but he is King of the Superhosts!  Wow!  Superlatives - there are not enough to describe Leonidas’ cottage / apartment.  We are looking to purchase a small property on Corfu  just for the two of us - this place would be ideal. It has everything you need or could want - an open fire  central heating  full size cooker with full size oven  fridge with freezer  a comprehensive assortment of pots & pans for cooking  a full range of small kitchen appliances such as kettle  toaster  sandwich maker  coffee machine etc  there is even a washing machine! There is also an iron  a hair dryer and a fire extinguisher. Leonidas has thought of everything to make his home your ‘home from home’ during your stay there. He’s even got a medical treasure trove with lotions & potions for bites  after sun and a whole range of other stuff - he’s even got a supply of feminine hygiene products in there. The attention to detail is amazing - haven’t had a chance to do a shop yet? There are ‘emergency’ supplies of toilet rolls  washing powder  fabric conditioner  Greek coffee  filter coffee  instant coffee  hot chocolate  water in the fridge etc. It was Easter Sunday when we arrived and Leonidas provided us with a large plate of freshly spit roasted chicken  painted (shells) red boiled eggs  olives off of his olive trees and red wine from his vineyard. His wine … is to die for - absolutely gorgeous. He brought us a 2nd bottle whilst we were there. The views - WOW! - Amazing. Surely it’s the best sunset on the island! Leonidas is a charming gentleman  intelligent  thoughtful  kind and a very friendly  bubbly character. We arrived as strangers - we left as friends. We will return! Perfecto! Thank you for allowing us to enjoy such a wonderful environment Leonidas. God Bless & take care. Jeff & Paula x Show more
42379262,Gaetan April 2022 perfect place !!!
42379262,Deividas April 2022 It is a great place to stay up in the hills and Leonidas did an extra mile for us to make it an even better stay. Unfortunately  we had a very windy and rainy morning  so couldn’t enjoy the most of it  but would recommend this place. Be cautious with driving up hill  but it is doable. And for less experienced drivers  take the road back  not forward.
42379262,Roy April 2022 Probably the best place to stay in Corfu for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle. Great place to write your book or thesis. the Airbnb is located on the highest point on the island with amazing views. Leonidas is a generous host and his attention to detail is considerable. We were only a couple for the night but the place is big and spacious and looks comfortable maybe even for a family. for sure the place is suitable for a long stay. There is central heating and hot water  a fully equipped kitchen and everything that comes to mind. There is a nice hiking trail right from the house up to the monastery. It is not part of the corfu trail  but it is really beautiful. It is about 1.5-2 hours hiking. It has an orange mark. When you get almost to the top you can continue on the main road direct to the monastery  or continue with the mark around the mountains  which is really nice but will take more time.  Thank you again Leonides
42379262,James April 2022 Leonidas provided us with a very beautiful place to sleep for 2 nights. It had a stunning view and we were greatful for the wine  eggs and olives! Would recommend staying here.
42379262,Rosey November 2021 We had a fabulous time at Leonidas' property. The accommodation is great for either a short or extended stay. The kitchen is great with good cooking facilities and there are other features including some toiletries provided. The location is great and can highly recommend the local taverna Boozoovey.
42379262,Antoinette October 2021 Great accommodation  well equipped and with everything you need. Leonidas is always ready to help us. The view is incredible  I hope to come back one day :)
42379262,Nadja September 2021 This was by far the cleanest house we ever booked on airbnb. Not to mention the view. Leonidas was a brilliant host  always at our disposal and very accommodating. He even brought us some locally grown fruit and vegetables. Absolutely commended.
42379262,Jana September 2021 This was my second stay at Leonidas‘ beautiful studio. After we had only one night there last year  I had to come back for more nights this time. Everything was just even more perfect than last year  because Leonidas has implemented all of our few small suggestions for improvement. The communication with Leonidas via messenger is exceptionally good and fast. He is really caring and helps you with whenever you need help. The welcome present from their own garden is something very unique and always so delicious. This was definitely not my last visit!
42379262,Tina September 2021 We had a super nice time at Leonidas place. It is very clean and everything you need is there. The location and the view from the terrace are amazing. Leonidas is very nice  friendly and super helpful! He even surprised us with a little welcome package of self grown vegetables  wine  olive oil and olives 🥰
42379262,Aldona August 2021 It was very comfortable stay   actually it was all house just for us . Attached house is one level upper   so you almost never see owners :) In our house was everything we needed and even more :) Kitchen was well equiped   it was washing mashine as well . Living room was comfortable to spend evening time and bedroom was nice as well . Appartment sityated up hill   so you defenitly need a car to stay there  but every evening you will enjoy amaizing view of sunset from you terrace . Also   in this village is super taverna with amaizing food   one of the best we tried in Corfu . So   you have to spent at least one evening there :) Also   apartment was extriemly clean . So   we recommend this place . And the owner of the place is very nice   he will always help you in any cases and will give you all ingomation needed :)
42379262,Kwnstantina August 2021 We spent two wonderful days in Strinilas village. Guests should keep in mind that the house is in the mountain at a quite isolated spot but the place is beautiful. The house is sparkling clean and Leonidas is very polite and helpful. He came to meet us and suggested a few places for eating and swimming. Ideal location for relaxing and overall amazing experience. Thank you!  Extra tip : Do not miss Boozoovey tavern at a nearby village. Great food  great people!
42379262,Sabine August 2021 Leonidas is a very kind host that takes the extra step in taking care of you during your stay. He responds almost immediately  left (very delicious) local wine  olive oil and other local treats for us. He’s a wonderful person with a lovely airbnb. Then the peaceful area is lovely to travel by scooter or car. Small cute villages with kind people everywhere. Tip: go to taverne oasis to have really great food  local wine  generous people and within walking distance of the airbnb. We stayed for 4 days  but regret staying longer!
42379262,Olivia June 2021 Everything was perfect. The apartment was clean  the view from the balcony is beautiful and Leonidas is such a friendly host! We can highly recommend☺️
42379262,Malo May 2021 Leonidas is a great host ! He came in a village to look for us beacause we were lost. The flat is very good and what a view of the valley. Thank you very very much Leonidas !
42379262,Maya May 2021 This place is absolutely lovely like his host. There is a lot of details who make you feel relax and happy! I really recommend this amazing apartments!
42379262,Tracy October 2020 A little Gem snuggled in the mountainside village of Strinilas  on Pantokrator.  First & foremost we can’t compliment Leonidas enough for his fabulous hospitality  he was attentive  thoughtful & incredibly helpful throughout our 18 night stay. We had a minor technical issue which Leonidas immediately responded to & quickly resolved. He checked in with us several times via email throughout our stay to make sure everything was ok  which we really appreciated.  Leonidas home has everything you could need for a short break or longer stay & it’s a good base for visiting most places on the island. The kitchen is well equipped & there were many thoughtful touches throughout (such as some basic toiletries  washing detergent  and plenty of loo roll!)  There’s so much to do  like visit the wonderful beaches  eat out  buy and cook fresh fish  a hike from the villa to the top of Pantokrator  a drive to Angelcastro  for some of the most spectacular views of the island & mountains of Albania  or a stroll through beautiful villages like Sokraki  Timoni or Nymphs. In short we loved the island  this lovely villa & Leonidas top hosting. Show more
42379262,"Carmen September 2020 When we arrived  the host Leonidas had some vegetables from the local harvest prepared for us in a basket. I think we ate up everything  because it was so tasty. :) During our stay he had always a nice recommendation if we needed inspiration. (To the restaurant ""Maistro"" on Acharavi Beach we even went twice  because the food was so good there.) But also the local taverns are very good and the owners very friendly! The cabin at the end of the road at the foot of Pantokrator mountain (highest mountain in Corfu) is pretty cozy and you have everything you need. The host really has some beautiful furnishing details at his place and we felt welcome and at home immediately. If you are looking for a place to have a little time out on the beautiful Isle of Corfu  you will have a good time looking at the sun go down from the terrace in front of your apartment."
42379262,Charlotte September 2020 We stayed at Leonidas's place for one week and had such an amazing time. It's so tranquil and peaceful up in the mountains  the perfect location if you're looking to get away from the tourists and live in an authentic Greek village. We rented a motorbike for the week so we could travel around the island  and I would recommend renting either a car/motorbike if staying here. The nearest supermarket is a 25min drive. Leonidas was a fantastic host  really attentive and let us check out late - thanks so much for an amazing holiday in Corfu! We will definitely be back again :)
42379262,Jana August 2020 We regret that we only booked for one night  because the stay at Leonidas‘ studio was perfect and the view at the location is just breathtaking. Even before our arrival and during the whole stay the host was so caring  always available via text message and replied immediately. The apartment was super clean and quiet  has a new spacious bathroom with a window  fully equipped kitchen and fly screens at every window and the door. The bed and the sofa bed were comfy and clean. In the bathroom there are useful things like toothpaste  mosquito repellent  after bite stick and other hygiene products. Leonidas also surprised us with some eggs and fresh fruits from their garden and a bottle of their house wine and organized to buy a big bottle of their wine in the morning  although he was at work. Next time we are going to stay more nights. We totally recommend the Pantokrator Sunside Studio for a relaxing stay on top of Corfu. Thank you  Leonidas!
42379262,Sandra August 2020 I highly recommend this place! It is perfect! Leonidas provided a lot of things that made the stay very convenient. The place is situated on the top of the mountain. The view of absolutely stunning!!! It is quite and peaceful! We've had extremely relaxing stay
42379262,Ayesha August 2020 The studio was in a perfect location after a days hiking with fantastic views of the sun set from the terrace. Leonidas was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. There are also two lovely tavernas in the village for dinner or drinks! Charming place.
42379262,Elena August 2020 Really nice  quiet studio up in the mountains with a wonderful view of the nature and the sea! We found everything we needed in the apartment. It has a big terrace where you can sit & enjoy the view. The small charming village has two tavernas  which we can really recommend. You can reach supermarkets in a few minutes with the car. Leonidas is a super & very kind host  we could always reach him over the chat. All in all  nice & friendly people  beautiful area  excellent host and an Airbnb that we can only recommend!
42379262,Tanju August 2020 What a charming view in the mountains..! It was absolutely amazing to see the whole island with that great sunset!! I strongly recommend Leonidas’s Airbnb. The place is also so cute and well decorated; fresh and clean! He is a great host  very responsive  kind and helpful! You should book at least 2 days to enjoy the mountains and this amazing Airbnb!
42379262,Iverna August 2020 This beautiful mountain village was our best experience on Corfu.
42379262,Veronika July 2020 Strinilas is a lovely village situated high in the mountains  driving there is a real adventure  we have enjoyed it much! The Pantokrator Sunset studio is amazing place to stay  it’s very quiet and nice clean apartment  in my opinion full equipped  cause we didn’t miss nothing during our one week stay. Leonidas is also great Host  who is taking care of the property very well and he was always attentive and ready to help us with every question we had. Totally recommended! If you prefer non touristic area  peaceful place and you are not lazy to hide in mountains  if you like hiking and the Pantokrator belongs to you highlights on you holiday  this is the right place for you! Thank you Leonidas!
42379262,Minko June 2020 The villa is more than you expect. It is spacious  clean and with an amazing view to the sea from the top of the mountain. There were small touches in every room. The bathroom is extremely clean and spacious  with everything you need inside including after bite stick. The kitchen is clean and the host even left coffee and sugar for us. The place is cosy and new. The host is really nice guy  always replying to our questions fast and politely. The one thing that we did not thought through was the location. We did not expect that it will be indeed on the top of the mountain in a little village. To get there you would need to ride through narrow spaghetti road  which was not our idea for vacation. After all it was our fault that we did not read the description very well. Other than that everything was perfect. It was the most amazing villa we have visited on the island. Thank you Leonidas.
42379262,Harald October 2022 Perfect home in the mountains. Fresh vegetables  well-equipped kitchen  also warm blanket for cool nights  friendly communication  everything available. Translated from German  Show original
42379262,Anna September 2022 The stay in the apartment was completely excellent. Leonidas was a helpful and nice host. The view from the apartment was magnificent. We will be happy to come back :-) Translated from German  Show original
42379262,Robert September 2022 Had a perfect stay on the highest mountain in Corfu. The house has a lovely garden where you can enjoy the sun under the fig tree and grapevine. The house is very clean and equipped with every comfort. We stayed here for 3 nights and had absolutely nothing to criticize. Translated from Dutch  Show original
42379262,Tara August 2022 We had a great time in the studio! Leonidas is a great host who has thought of all the little details! the studio is located in a small quiet village  the view is magnificent. this place is perfect for relaxing and visiting the more mountainous part of the island  we would be more than happy to go back! 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Αλεξανδρα August 2022 Perfect for relaxing and tranquil. The view even more captivating than the listing photos show. The house has all the comforts. The host is pleasant and helpful. We'll be back for sure! Translated from Greek  Show original
42379262,Martina August 2022 We couldn't be happier with our stay in Corfu at Leonidas' place. The house is immersed in the peace and quiet on the slopes of Mount Pantokrator. Equipped with everything you need  extremely clean and comfortable. The location allows you to visit both coastlines within an hour by car. Leonidas was available for all our requests  the definition of Superhost! Surely if I were to return to Corfu I would have no hesitation in returning to this adorable oasis of peace. Translated from Italian  Show original
42379262,Boris July 2022 The Leonidas maisonette is a small wonder located in the heart of the mountains  you can easily walk among the olive trees  we eat (well) in the village (a few minutes' walk away)  we will swim (in 20 minutes by car). Far from the hustle and bustle of the coast  it is a relaxing place where you can admire from the terrace of splendid sunsets. Leonidas is very accommodating but also extremely friendly and interesting. It was a very nice stay for us Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Frank July 2022 A wonderful place to stay from a very warm host. The sunset is simply fantastic and we enjoyed the tranquility very much. We highly recommend it! Translated from German  Show original
42379262,Θανάσης July 2022 Adorable mountain structure with a unique view both in the morning and at night at sunset. The Leonidas was very accommodating and helped us make our stay as pleasant as possible! It wants some attention with the roads in but the location pays off Translated from Greek  Show original
42379262,Christophe April 2022 Leonidas' place is ideal for a mountain stopover when visiting the island. Not only is the view superb with an attractive terrace and it has everything you need to feel good especially as you are perfectly welcomed. A nice hiking trail starts from the house in the direction of Mount Pantokrator (What a view of a good part of the island and the high snow-covered Albanian mountains at this time!). Either you go to the top and it takes 3.5 hours to get to and from (we were satisfied with 1 hour)  or you can drive 15 minutes. A small tip in April: arrive before 4 p.m. at the mountain  otherwise the gates of the chapel are closed. It's a very pleasant time. To swim  you don't have to be chilly  but you can rest easy without the crowds. Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Nashau March 2022 The apartment is perfect  what more could you say? Except for the immense generosity  Leonidas' huge heart and his contagious good mood  I would recommend 10000 times  this is the best place I found on the island  with a magnificent view and I even got a breathtaking snowy landscape  I would come back for sure  a thank you would not be enough for everything Leonidas has implemented for my stay Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Lydia October 2021 A very nice place to stay  everything picobello. The view is magnificent  exactly as pictured. Far from the tourist crowds. You can recharge  switch off and take beautiful hikes. It is also well equipped with a lot of love for details. We enjoyed it very much. Translated from German  Show original
42379262,Johann August 2021 Excellent  quiet  relaxing location in the area  very nice view of the sunset  very good welcome gift:-) well furnished  clean and very friendly and helpful host! Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Camille July 2021 We stayed for a week in Leonidas' lovely home  a sublime stay on the island. With lovely touches when we arrive. The house is very well located and this terrace is perfect for admiring the view. A true haven of peace !! ευχαριστώ πολώ Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Barend June 2021 A nice clean place  to stay outside the tourist areas in an original mountain village. There are 2 taverns in the village and a good kilometer further there is another. Leonidas is an excellent host  always responding quickly. You can enjoy breakfast outside in the garden. It is necessary to have your own transportation. We have been there for 1 week and had a great time  made many excursions from there and then in the evening eat in the local taverns. Barend and Astrid. Translated from Dutch  Show original
42379262,Gabi August 2020 A great host. A cozy studio in seclusion. Everything perfect Translated from German  Show original
42379262,Laffourcade August 2020 The house perched in leonidas is amazing! In addition to the view  the house is very comfortable and welcoming. Leonidas is a fantastic host. He left us local fruits and vegetables  local wine and everything you need in the bathroom (toothpaste  sanitary towels  shampoo  conditioner...). We highly recommend this place! The best we've found in Corfu  amazing value for money! Translated from French  Show original
42379262,Beatrice July 2020 Perfect! This so romantic and at the same time so functional is perfect! Peaceful  slight breeze  sunset over the sea and its islands  mountain hikes and yet very easy  tavern with authentic and generous kitchen under the magnificent elm (3 times century old!) . ... Leonidas moved us by his delicate touches and his lovely welcome. Translated from French  Show original
33703123,Kostas September 2022 Very cosy  clean and fully equiped small house  in a very nice and quiet village (kamares). Hosts very friendly and always full of advice on how to go around in Corfu. Definitely recommended.
33703123,Stefania August 2022 the house is the most clean house I've ever been. all the things are carefully selected proving that hosts are caring. we arrived late and they were waiting for us to show us the house and talk to us. they even have welcome fruits and wine! house has everything! you will feel extra comfortable. it's in the center of the village accessable only by car. the neighborhood is quiet. there are no things to do in the village but there are nearby beaches. you need to be careful with the stairs and if you are more than 1 83 the bathroom will be very challenging. I'm 1 80 and was a little tough. I wasn't feeling good one day and the host help me and asked how I was. very polite  very nice house. must stay.
33703123,Wojciech June 2022 Georgia's house is exactly as she described. I just need to add -perfect cleanliness and attention to details. A huge advantage is the quiet air conditioner in the bedroom that will help you sleep. General parking is very close from the Georgia's cottage. It is a great place for excursions in any direction of the island. I recommend a small and manoeuvrable car for this. We had a great time there!
33703123,Jan October 2021 Amazing stay  Georgia is absolutely lovely host. We got not only welcome drink  beers  cake  etc.  but she really cares all the time. We loved this village life  neighborhood.  Thank you again🤗  we will come back.
33703123,Katerina September 2021 Beautiful  quaint village. Georgia and her husband were welcoming and very helpful. Highly recommended!
33703123,Chris September 2021 What a great find! 20 min from Corfu Town. Sweet intimate house with everything you need: Airconditioning  WiFi  TV  oven  microwave  freezer etc etc So many wonderful details. There was even yoghurt fruit and water and wine when I arrived. Georgia and her husband are you wonderful hosts. Highly recommend!!
33703123,Lea-Maria September 2021 Georgias small house was awesome. We really enjoyed staying there and had a great experience. Check In/Out as well and the Communication was pleasant throughout. It was perfectly clean and Georgia provided everything you need even some fruit and wine. We would highly recommend Georgia’s small house.
33703123,Ann Sofie August 2021 The place is small and cozy - perfect for two people. Has everything you need. We especially enjoyed the location in the hills  away from all the massive tourism! :)
33703123,Tsoni July 2021 Wonderful accommodation  perfectly located in the middle of Corfu and great for exploring the island with a car/quad/bike. Very quiet and calm village  kind neighbours and of course a very friendly and helpful hosts - Georgia and Panos  who helped to make our stay am unforgettable experience. Totally recommend  amazing value for the money. I will definitelycome again!
33703123,Katharina June 2021 The house is very nice  clean and tiny. I had no problems because I am small :) it's situated in a nice small village with incredible nice people.
33703123,Portia October 2020 Firstly I’d like to note how incredibly welcoming and lovely Georgia has been throughout our stay- we felt by the end of the week that we had a valued relationship with not only her but all the neighbouring locals  and were sad to leave the beautiful homely atmosphere. Her home also became somewhere that we adored; with a modern yet rustic bathroom and more than satisfactory kitchen amenities  ranging from a new filtered coffee machine  to every piece of crockery  cutlery and saucepan. The bedroom was even cuter  up a staircase to a queen sized bed and large storage spaces. Many lovely meals where had on our doorstep  quiet and private yet still immersed in this villages culture. In regards to location  we were in walking distance from a grill (that Georgia also gave us the number for their takeaway service) and just under an hours walk to the supermarket. By taxi everything is within 25 mins (old Corfu town and a seaside village with many restaurants and bars) which is very cheap :) thank you Georgia- we are endlessly grateful for a heavenly week away !
33703123,Vangelis September 2020 The House was absolutely perfect  the location was quiet like we want  Georgia the host couldn't be better  she make as feel like it was ours house.The best Holidays ever
33703123,Tereza September 2020 Georgia is a very nice host. The apartment was clean and ready. It is really small but cosy apartment  taller people could have a problem. The host always helps us when we need something. A little disadvantage was insect  especially ants and mosquitoes. There was basic equipment in the kitchen and bathroom  TV  hairdryer etc. Kamara is a small village  shops are about 5 kilometres far from apartment  so it is better to have a car. I can recommend Georgia's small house.
33703123,Marc September 2020 Georgia and her husband are very lovely people and made us feel very welcome. The place was very clean and had all the necessities you need. They picked us up when we where stranded in corfu and are quick to reply.  The village is remote. So you do need a car but its a very cute small village.  Only minus would be the tight stairs and the low ceiling in the bathroom. So if you are a tall person you might have issues in this place.
33703123,Barbara September 2020 If you are looking for a comfortable little nest in a small village on the island  Georgia's place is perfect for you: very quiet location  nice neighbours  a lot of small attentions from Georgia that are very appreciable. We had three days visiting around that were simply perfect.
33703123,Hitesh August 2020 Georgia and her husband are so sweet and warm. It completely warmed our hearts to stay at their house. We also found a wine bottle waiting at our door step. You both are amazing and we loved your warm welcome to your small home.
33703123,Bader August 2020 As if words can describe the wonderful experience that Georgia and her husband gave us! Not only did they provide us such a beautiful house with delicacy  they also enchanted us with handmade wine and extraordinary hospitality. Come visit this village and meet the people and be showered with warmth and love :) P/S: The house is fully equipped with everything you might need (if you happen to be a backpacker). The road to Kamara is not so convenient on foot so we recommend you taking a motorbike or a car.
33703123,Karol July 2020 The house is in very nice  small traditional village with friendly local people. It is a good base for discovering the island as it is located in the center of the island and out of Kerkyra (Corfu city)  so you avoid the traffic (but it is a short drive to Kerkyra). Parking is convenient less then two walking minutes from house. Hosts are very friendly and helpful. House was very clean and everything I needed was provided. One thing to note. The stairs to the second floor (bedroom) are a bit steep so the place is not suitable for small children. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again in Georgia’s place.
33703123,Vincels July 2020 What a gem! We LOVED this cute little house. A special experience to stay a few nights in this traditional place. Georgia was very welcoming and gave us a delicious present.  The neighbours were super friendly and the neighbor cats were socializing -and foodbegging- in front of the door :)  Supermarkets on a 5/10 min drive. You can get drinking water on the square 100m from the house.  Note that if you’re tall (1m90) the bathroom ceiling is too low  so you need to stoop while taking a shower :)  Excellent  highly recommended.
33703123,Nikolaos June 2020 Very nice  cute house in a beautiful Corfu village! Many places around to explore! Very kind and helpful host too!
33703123,Ewen August 2019 We stayed in Georgia litlle hous 8 days. The house is clean  well equiped and it's location allow you to rest within a quiet and atical village. The hotes are very kind and the communication in english is easy. We enjoys our trip and now it is your turn !
33703123,Johannes August 2019 Hands down  this was probably one of the best air bnb places I have ever stayed at  the place is small yes  but when we arrived  we felt it was bigger than we expected. It was very clean and tidy and had everything you would need. Georgia and her husband were wonderful  they gave us a lot of tips for beaches or where to get the best food. Every question we had was answered immediately. This was definitely a super good trip! If I come back to corfu definitely back here!
33703123,Małgorzata July 2019 It is wonderfull place to stay. Clean and beautiful. Fully recomended!!!
33703123,Morgan July 2019 Kamara is a non touristic village. Exactly what we wanted. Good location to go north and south.
33703123,Silvia July 2019 The apartment is cosy and comfortable. It has everything you need. The place is very quite  it is for this reason we have choosed this location. The host is very kind; she offered to us mussaka' and different wines. The Greek neighbor are very friendly and very nice.
33703123,Michela June 2019 I spent an amazing holiday of one week in the beautiful Georgia and Panos' place. The house is perfectly clean and cozy. The village of Kamara is very calm and welcoming  locals do not hesitate to talk with you or help you in any way. By car it only takes 15/20 minutes to reach extremely beautiful beaches with crystal water. Me and my boyfriend loved our stay  Georgia cooked us a typical greek dish that was delicious and gave us bottles of wine that his husband locally produces. If you will be travelling by car  I definitely suggest you to stay in Georgia's place  beautiful house with amazing hosts !
33703123,Alissa October 2022 We were delighted with our stay. The accommodation is clean and super well located on the island. The hosts are incredibly hospitable. The neighborhood is very friendly. If you want a full immersion experience you have to come here. Translated from French  Show original

33703123,Sònia August 2022 Lovely tiny house with everything you need. Georgia also has nice touches like leaving some fruit and a bottle of wine in the fridge. Highly recommended! Translated from Catalan  Show original
33703123,Xavier August 2022 Excellent stay in Kamara with Georgia and Panos. The house is small but enough for one or two people. Kamara is a small authentic village situated in the centre of the island  close to the beautiful beaches of the Western coast. It should also be noted that both hosts are kind  welcoming and responsive. In short  excellent value for money! I highly recommendit! Translated from French  Show original
33703123,Philipp August 2022 Small but nice place to stay. If you are taller than 1.85 meters  but could get problems due to the narrow  steep stairs and in the bathroom. Otherwise  you have everything you need on a small space. You are far from the tourist hustle and bustle on the beaches and live in the small village only among locals. However  due to the matter of the place  it is advisable to rent a car or motorcycle to explore the island or to visit different beaches in the summer. Georgia and Panos are wonderful hosts and always available for questions. We would come back anytime! Translated from German  Show original
33703123,Cécile July 2022 Georgia and her husband are very friendly and pleasant hosts.

The house is cute and very small  access to the pretty bedroom is via a steep staircase but it is well equipped and very pleasant to live in with a small table outside that allows you to have your meals outside. It is located in the heart of an authentic and quiet village where it is nice to be with locals. We set up our base camp there for the duration of our stay in Corfu and are very happy about it. It's best to be motorized  for us  we rented a scooter at Space Bikes  delivered there. We highly recommend Georgia small house. It's a great place. A big thank you to Georgia and Panos.

33703123,Romane May 2022 Georgia's studio is perfect for travelers wanting to get away from the tourist crowd of downtown. There is everything you need in the apartment  the bed is very comfortable and the kitchen area is functional. The city center of Corfu is still accessible  the bus and bus is a 13-minute walk away and the journey takes about 20 minutes. The village is very quiet and its residents are very welcoming and always ready to do service. When in Georgia and her husband Pamos they are adorable and always available if you have any questions .

33703123,Florian October 2021 Georgia and her husband are great. Super friendly and nice. Communication and check-in were absolutely hassle-free. They also surprised me with little gifts. The little house is clean and cozy. Okay  in the bathroom I had to duck a little bit at my 1.90 m and the stairs were a bit narrow  but that's perfectly fine and you know that beforehand. It didn't bother me Kitchen  bathroom  bedroom... it was all well equipped. I really can't fault it. If you like it a little quieter  this is the place to be. Dear Georgia  I would come back to you anytime. I would highly recommend it to anyone:) Translated from German  Show original

33703123,Elisabeth July 2021 Great accommodation  cozy for a vacation with two  its location is interesting for visiting the island. The hosts are lovely  attentive and helped us several times throughout the stay. When we arrived  we even had a small welcome basket  which is very nice after the journey from France to here! The apartment is air-conditioned  protected from mosquitoes  the bed is very comfortable too. The bathroom is functional. We did not rent a car  there is a bus stop not too far away (10 min walk maximum) which takes you to the city center of Corfu city. We were able to use the green bus network that transport throughout the island.  In sum  we had a very pleasant time in this small house and on this island  I highly recommend this place !

33703123,"Ramon September 2020 Well- the now  the Superhost credit that seems less constructive to me doesn't make it any easier for me to review. It seems that the core expertise is: clean  according to the description  and intact communication. So  Georgia and her  she supportive brother would really be top Super Hosts. Both were extremely friendly  attentive and helpful and the provided treats (own house wine  water  fruit) are not a matter of course. The tiny house is really extremely lovingly and well thought out - a real wonder of the room  stylish and modern (bathroom)  bedroom. - Netflix TV! You must have seen this small house!! And yet  I can only recommend it to a limited extent. Even as a solo traveler  I had my physical constraints in the kitchen and bathroom (ground floor)- perhaps a personal problem? As modern and tastefully furnished as the bathroom was - the narrow sink was normally hardly usable  as it is very narrow and to wash your face over it  you have to carefully dive into the basin  with your nose on the bottom and even then you can feel the  emergencyly  very low-hanging mirror cabinet on the back. With the stool in the shower  I only assumed a measure for handicrafted people until I realized that the low ceiling plus sloped was difficult to allow standing upright at my 1.78 m - but it ended up being relatively relaxed  even without a stool! The icing on the cake is the narrow and steep staircase to the relatively lush bedroom upstairs. Here  too  everything the traveler needs is available to their satisfaction. I haven't experienced the working Netflix TV option yet. The bedroom is really easy to live by 2 people after the cramped impressions of the kitchen and bathroom on the ground floor. For the kitchen and bathroom  on the other hand  does it possibly require a well-established team? But what really disappointed me was the village that didn't exist for me in the end - just a collection of some apartment buildings  even a church but nothing else. Unfortunately  nothing also refers to the lack of views from the house and ultimately not the seating area in front of the house overlooking the opposite house wall. The location of the ""village"" Kamara is strategically quite passable but beautiful is different. You will really find peace here. Both neighbors and the only noticeable rooster were extremely quiet  fortunately no trace from dogs. Well  I don't find it easy in this case: real Superhosts  a lovingly decorated tiny house that you must see and offers everything  peace and quiet except for the view and noteworthy village character.

584590102218667652,Felicitas October 2022 The house is perfect and located in a nice area. It’s very clean and cosy. The kitchen is perfectly equipped. The host is very friendly and gives great recommendations for the area. We had a great time and would definitely recommend staying there.
584590102218667652,Jackie September 2022 This is the second time we have staying in this villa. It is truly amazing! The view from the balcony and pool is incredible. The villa is very spacious and has air con in all bedrooms. There are hairdryers available plus a fan in the living room. It is well equipped too - there was 9 of us and there was plenty of glasses etc. The drive is steep so be prepared - first gear and try not to stop! There is a cafe and restaurant right on the beach which is walk-able from the villa. We ate at the beach restaurant every evening - service great and food most of the time very good. The supermarket in the village nearby is excellent. Has everything. Pool very clean and pool person came twice in our stay. Also the villa gets cleaned half way through the stay which was lovely. The host gets back to you very quickly and very helpful. We all had a fabulous time!
584590102218667652,Sean September 2022 Great view of Kerasia Bay and a spacious villa. Access road is very steep and unmade but fine by car.

584590102218667652,Georgina August 2022 Walking distance to kerasia beach & Agios stefanos so very well located. A few teething issues with the villa which were sorted immediately by lovely helpful host- George. We enjoyed our stay immensely:-)
17869884,Parsla October 2022 We had a great stay. Appartment was very clean and cosy with a couple of cute cats garding it and welcoming each guest. Kitchen is quite small so I would say the apartment is perfect for short stays and those who mostly eat outside. Communication was great both before and during our stay. We got all the instructions and recommendations. Everything is located in close proximity. Hosts took good care of us and even gave us some delicious fruits from their garden. Thank you very much for your hospitality!
17869884,Polly September 2022 We had an amazing stay in the Yellow room! Felt very relaxed there and with a lovely outside space. One night we cooked a meal in the bbq and ate it under the olive tree outside which was lovely. Cute kittens and a dog roaming around outside which made it feel homely. Host is so friendly and helpful  answered our questions when we had them! very easy to get a hold of and gave us great recommendations for places to eat and drink in Corfu town. Would love to return one day.

17869884,Francesco September 2022 Where to start…a beautiful location  with beautiful energy  where you can feel yourself at home the very moment you step in! The most peculiar thing is the kindness of the host  who always finds a way to take care of your needs  filling you with attention during all the staying  really incomparable to others! Demetra and Nicholas make you feel part of their family and allow you to live the island in its essence!!! The house is near Corfu town and very central and connected. The studio was very clean  with all the comforts and gadgets you need  including a wonderful kitchen and books to read. It included a parking spot for our scooter. In our opinion the best choice we could do! See you soon Demetra and Nicholas :)
17869884,Francesco August 2022 This house is really clean and fantastic for the position (it is near to the bus stop for buses to Corfù town and for the other beaches of the island). Demetra was always avaible and she took care of us during all the stay. This house is absolutely recommended.
17869884,Chiara August 2022 Small but functional accommodation  complete with everything you need  perfect for two people. Very very quiet place and the host Demetra is super helpful! We had a great time
17869884,Samantha August 2022 Nice  comfortable stay! The outdoor area was lovely and the host was so friendly  she really made sure we were comfortable and she have us lots of directions and great suggestions.
17869884,Bogdan July 2022 My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Demetras place. It was a short stay  but we had everything we needed and the garden is beautiful. Demetra  as well is a great host and she helped us with whatever question we had. The location is 3min near a bus station  so if you need to go to/from corfu town  it's a 25min ride with bus.
17869884,Sophia July 2022 Boho kinda feel with the beautiful rustic garden surrounded by olive trees. Everything you could possibly need is supplied in the mini kitchen. Stayed cool even in 30 degree heat at night no air on needed. Easy to get to from the airport by bus. Best to rent a scoota so you can travel to all the nicer beaches ✌🏻
17869884,Athanasia July 2022 Great place! Very clean and the hosts very kind!! Good price as well! Response from Anastasia July 2022 Thank you very much Anastasia!! Translated  Show original
17869884,Laura Isabel June 2022 The place has a perfect location! Tourist attractions can be easily reached by bus. The place was very beautiful and clean  and Demetria was a perfect host
17869884,Olga June 2022 Lovely place to stay  close to sea and lot of cafes  there are also shops and bus stop close to house so you can easily get to any place you'd like. Highly recommend this place to stay and enjoy nature an nice company of pet's and locals :)
17869884,Tom May 2022 It's a lovely place to stay  very carefully made in a stylish family way - you don't get those warm personal touches if you book with businesses. Lovely outside areas and really quiet and green even though it's close to town. The most helpful and friendly hosts you could ask for.
17869884,Charlotte April 2022 We had a lovely stay in the Yellow studio and our trip to Corfu was even more successful and enjoyable because of our wonderful host! The studio has everything you need for a comfortable stay and perfect if you want to cook a few meals and eat in a couple of nights too. We sat out in the beautiful set-up outside  listening to the wildlife sounds and spotting fireflies in the evening. Demetra was so helpful with tips and advice  we were grateful as we were there over Easter and there was lots to see and do  she told us all the best places to go and we felt very well looked after. It was also great to have her insight on places that would be open as we were there in April which is still off-season and lots of the beach/resort areas were closed. The bus is really nearby - we did a mix of getting the bus into town a few days and hiring a car to explore other parts of the Island which I highly recommend. It is possible to get busses elsewhere but we were really glad to have hired the car as it was much easier. Some amazing places we visited were the village of Lakones  Palaiokastritsa beach and monastery  Angelokastro castle  Old Perithia (the abandoned village)  Kassiopi (beautiful coastal walk and fishing village) and Corfu Town. Thanks again for a wonderful stay. Show more
17869884,Jahnavi September 2021 Demetra's place at Corfu was wonderful. The apartment is cozy and comfortable. The common garden area is filled with olive and fruit trees which gives the place the mediterranean charm! The place is very clean and the description given is accurate. Her place is away from the noisy busy streets and is very peaceful. Demetra is very friendly and always made sure we were happy and comfortable. She also gave us wonderful suggestions for beaches  sightseeing and restaurants around Corfu. There are many wonderful restaurants accessible by walk and also a mini market for your needs.
17869884,Samantha September 2021 Our stay was beyond amazing—great communication  super helpful tips about food and beaches on the island  and a wonderful yard to enjoy as well. It is probably best to rent a car or scooter here  as the bus connection works  but isn‘t ideal. We had a lovely week!
17869884,Misha July 2021 Great place for staying  unique design and interesting decor inside  friendly atmosphere and very nice location  highly recommend.

17869884,Haley July 2021 Very friendly and helpful hosts. There was an issue with the Wi-Fi and they fixed the issue quickly for me. You need to take the bus/car/taxi to get into town. Overall  I enjoyed my stay.
17869884,Péter July 2021 First of all… I can really recommend this place. I spent 7 days here with my girlfriend and everything was perfect. The description and the photos are realistic. The apartment was clean and well equipped. It’s particularly cool to relax in the big garden among lots of plants and animals. There you can feel the real Greek village feeling. The hosts are really good and kind people and they are very helpful in every way.
17869884,Jana July 2021 This is one of the places that you feel like you don’t want vacations to end. The house and the garden creates peaceful hideout from busy world around us and Demetra and her family surrounds you with kindnesses and laugh. And if you are an animal lover   you are at home there :) Demetra  thanks for one of the best holidays we’ve had in a long time!!

17869884,Patrick August 2020 Yellow apartment is a rustic and characteristic place. Later we discovered this apartment is not like most apartment on the island  which felt touristic and looks all the same. We felt like home and as a creative person I could imagine this place to stay longer and work remotely in quite. A highly recommend this apartment if you seek for something different.
17869884,Ákos August 2020 Firendly hosts  well-equipped apartment.
17869884,Vladyslav August 2020 Super friendly and lovely place. You can feel the love in every detail of the room. The location is perfect  you have beaches around  a lot of restaurants. You can easily reach any point of the island from there. In room you can find anything you want and even more. The garden is well-maintained  you can spend some time there with the book or food in company of many cute pets :) This place feels like home  and you will definitely want to come back!
17869884,Berkin July 2020 This place was way beyond my expectations. The location is a great start if you want to visit every part of the island  different parts each day. The hosts are so nice and lovely  friendly and helpful. I loved how we were surrounded with animals; cats  dog  chickens. The nature is just awesome. It feels like you are in a village but also so close to the beach. The garden is amazing  breakfast there is a great start to the day. The flat feels so cosy  also you have everything you need in the kitchen if you want to cook. If I ever go back to Corfu  this is definitely the place I will stay again.
17869884,Miodrag July 2020 Extremely polite hosts  wonderful family  excellent apartment  beautiful garden  we spent very happy week with them. It is a quiet and a very inspiring place*** 💛 If five stars is an excellent note  then they deserve 5.555.555 stars  even more than this  all stars from the summer night sky :)
17869884,Stefan September 2019 Accommodation in middle of olive groves and grapevines. Very romantic with little cats  a dog and chickens.
17869884,Iris September 2019 It was the best airbnb experience I've ever had. The studio is perfectly sized for two people. It has everything one can need  including cute pets and very friendly hosts! We could always ask Demetra and her husband for advice and they always helped us out 😊 I can only recommend it  it's close to corfu city  but gouvia also has everything to cover your basic needs 😁 Would come here again!
17869884,Aggelos August 2019 The apartment was beyond our expectations. The perfect place to be..It was very clean and it felt like home!!! The hostess was very kind and friendly and she aaaalways smiles!! I've in many apartments in Greece. Although it was the first I said this is PERFECT!!!  I strongly recommend this apartment.

17869884,Lauren July 2019 Our stay at Studio Yellow was perfect. The little cottage is lovely and full of quirky little wonders  and there is lots of outdoor space to use  for relaxing and dining. Amazing hosts with lots of local tips - highly recommended staying here  we would happily move in permanently!
17869884,Ming Lee June 2019 Anastasia is super nice and really friendly. She responded very quickly to my queries and also send me lots of information and photos on how to check in since she wont be around at that time and I managed to check in smoothly. Her place is like a home away from home. Very quiet and tranquil.
17869884,Tamati May 2019 Had a lovely stay at Nicholas and Demethra's studio for a couple of nights. The place is easy to get to from Corfu town via the frequent buses. The studio is on a beautiful property surrounded by fruit and olive trees. Such a cozy place  highly recommend.
17869884,Anne-Laure May 2019 Demetra and her husband are lovely hosts and will make your stay as confortable as possible. The location is not far away from the center (15-20 min with a blue bus) and quiet. In the evening  I loved to sit under the olive trees in the beautiful garden!
17869884,Deniz October 2018 This is a very nice flat owned by a wonderful family with a big garden situated near to anything you might like for example a visit to a small or big town  beach or forest  museum or restaurants. The warm welcome  the olive trees and comfortable garden furniture and the stars at night  made us feel at home. Especially the local tips and information about the island were very useful. We (and my service dog) enjoyed our stay very much. Would love to go back. Its a beautiful place to BE and a joy to meet the family.
17869884,Éric October 2018 We spent a week in Nicholas and Demethra's studio and it was perfect. The studio is really great  well located and had all we needed Nicholas and his wife Demethra are really lovely people. They gave us a lot of good places to go for a drink  to eat local dishes or to visit. This was our best experience in AirBNB  truly!!  If you are going to Corfou this is the place to be!!!
17869884,David September 2018 An absolute find. The accommodation is lovely  private  spotlessly clean  and such great value for money.  Superb outside seating area with table and chairs. Nice place to chill  read  eat and watch the sunset. It overlooks an olive grove. Very quiet and peaceful home and garden.  Its a 5 minute walk to the main road  transport  buses and the lively Gouvia village with shops restuarants and beach.  The host family could not be more charming and helpful.  THANK YOU
17869884,Adam September 2018 Demetra and Nicholas are ready to help with everything you need  you wont find better hosts. As for studio it's cosy place with everything you need and olive garden just outside your front door. Location is great as well  there is bus stop nearby  restaurants are just few minutes away and you even have parking spot. Gouvia might not be the best place to stay for longer but being in the center of the Corfu it's good starting point for the trips.
17869884,Alison August 2018 Thank you so much for being such lovely hosts. This place is idyllic and the studio had everything you need and made for a perfect stay. Demetra welcomed me.on my arrival gave great tips on the area and was nice and flexible about my late arrival times. Super communication w messages too and lively and friendly. I would recommend this comfortable and thoughtfully presented studio without hesitation. And the little kitten and puppy were super cute company too! many thanks for having me stay. Alison 😊
17869884,Denis August 2018 Very beautiful place  large patio with tables and trees. There are also many pets that are interesting to play with children. The room is very clean and cozy  the hosts are hospitable. From the city it is convenient to travel by bus to the north of the island and to the capital. I will advise this accommodation to friends.

17869884,Gabriela August 2018 My friend and I have been travelling trough Italy and Greece for a few weeks and this is by far the best place we have stayed at. The location is brilliant- with a beach being 10 minutes away and a market just around the corner. The house itself is in a quiet location  but the busier Gouvia town is very close. There is a 2 min walk to the bus stop which may take you to anywhere around the island. We cannot say one bad thing about the hosts as they were very welcoming and helpful. We will definitely book a stay here if we were to come again!
17869884,William August 2018 Wonderful and thoughtful hosts in a beautiful  slightly off the beaten track location. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend or stay again
17869884,Jessica July 2018 Truly wonderful hosts! They were very responsive and helped with transportation  giving us ideas of things to do  and greeted us right when we got there! Would definitely stay with them again!
17869884,Helene July 2018 Nicholas and Demetra have made our stay in Corfou an amazing time. They were really lovely people  always ready to help or to give advice! The place was well aranged  very nice very quiet but close to the bus stop  the beach and Gouvia city center. If you are looking for a place to stay in Corfou  choose this one !
17869884,Patty July 2018 Demetra and Nicolas were such lovely hosts   so sweet   kind and helpfull...their house is great with a lovely rural garden in a very central convenient position to discover the island...really recomend a stay with them !
17869884,Anna July 2018 Amazing place!!!  Nicolas and Demetras's house is a perfect place for a Corfu vacation. Perfectly located to discover all sites and beaches  very close connection by both car and bus from the airport. Very beautiful and tranquil place with its own garden. The hospitality was amazing. If only everyone could make you feel same at home as this family does. Many thanks to these wonderful people and their home for making me feel my best at the island.
17869884,"Peter July 2018 What great hosts. They picked us up from our previous hotel saving a taxi fare. The room was an eclectic mix of furniture but was functional with everything you'd need provided. This was a ""proper"" Airbnb - great room and great hosts."
17869884,Tristan July 2018 Lovely place to stay ! Very homely  peaceful and very clean ...... Easy to get to nearby beaches etc. Thanks for hoisting us !
17869884,Lan June 2018 We spent an enjoyable time at Demetra's and Nicholas' place. Everything was prepared perfectly  more than what we expected. They also gave us a lot of tips about where to go. Have to note: there are enthousiastic pets present  and the (neighbours') dogs will bark at night. Overall a great place to stay!
17869884,Roxane June 2018 We didn't meet Nicholas  but his wife Demetra welcomed us very warmly. She gave us many advices for trips  sightseeing and nice places to relax. The communication between host and guest is perfect and the accommodation is cozy and clean as well - we instantly felt like home. (the 2 cuddly dogs welcomed us every time we went outside.)  We cannot imagine a better start to explore Corfu and enjoy our holidays. Thank you very much  Demetra!  100% recommended Roxy & Yannik
17869884,Mateo May 2018 Everything was great :) Apartmant and our host were very nice :) We highly recommend this apartmant and hosts :)
17869884,Laura May 2018 Very lucky to be hosted by a really amazing family. The location is perfect to reach anywhere in the island  the house is clean  cozy  nice kitchen  surrounded by a very big and relaxing garden and Demetra and Nico gave us help  good tips for food/beaches/events and hospitality! We felt very welcomed and we couldn't ask more then what we had. We really raccomend it and it is a place to come back to.
17869884,Peter April 2018 Me and my girlfriend stayed at Nicholas’s place for 3 nights. It was a wonderful experience. His place is located is Gouvia  very close to a bus station. We came to the airport and came to Nicholas’s place with a bus. The ride takes about 30 minites. Nicholas helped us with the number of buses and timetables. He even picked us up on the bus station. It takes 10 minutes by foot from Nicholas to the beach. His home is very quiet and relaxing. Nicholas is a great host. He replied very quick  gave us advice and was overal very friendly. A very good experience!
17869884,Frank April 2018 Nice quiet place! A little house (in a big house) with a real nice (big) garden. The streets in Gouvia are busy  but just around the corner  in the near end of a dead end street is the oasis of the garden of Nicolas and Demetra’s home. No noise  just the cats  dogs and chickens talking. Various spots to sit and in the evening nice too (but in april stil a bit cold). It’s near the city centre of Corfu city  easy to go by scooter  bus or car. Supermarkets and beach in walking distance. Nicolas and Demetra are exellent hosts  the house is clean  kitchen is great  WiFi is perfect and anything you want to know about corfu lies in books and folders inside the house! Stil  if you want to be alone  you can just relax in the garden. Read a book. Perfect. Will visit again when in Corfu!
17869884,Elena April 2018 Nicholas e Demetra sono stati degli ospiti impeccabili  la nostra esperienza è stata completamente positiva e ha confermato le recensioni positive che abbiamo letto prima di sceglierli! L'appartamento è piccolo (va bene per una coppia) ma fornito di tutto  è perfetto per un soggiorno di qualche giorno in un luogo tranquillo fuori dal caos turistico ma a 15 min di auto dalla città.  Attenzione alle indicazioni per raggiungere l'appartamento  si trova in una via privata e l'indirizzo di Airbnb vi porterà vicino ma non nel punto esatto. Demetra è stata gentilissima e ci è venuta a prendere in auto. Contattate per un aiuto ad orientarvi se serve!  Alloggio semplice ma perfetto  accoglienza strepitosa  torneremo sicuramente!
17869884,Monika October 2017 Demetra and Nicholas created the place which is the essence of airbnb. It is simply what you are looking for on airbnb  mix of local experience  great hospitality  good value for money  feeling welcomed and cared. Gouvia itself is good place to explore north part of Island as there are plenty of buses passing by. I highly recommend this place!
17869884,Joel September 2017 Nicholas was a perfect host! He messaged in perfect English  with excellent information and helpful tips for the area and travel. The place itself was ideal for us. Located around 5 mins walk from a little town with great options for restaurants and bars. The beach is less than 10 mins walk. Value for money was excellent. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and return again. Thanks again. Joel and phillippa Response from Anastasia September 2017 Thank you very much for staying with us Phillippa and Joel  we hope to see you again  you are always welcome at our place.
17869884,Alexandre September 2017 We were a student couple and came here in Sept 2017. This is a little lovely and cute place to live for 2 people. There is all we need and we miss nothing: kitchen  coffee and tea machine  bathroom with towels  outdoor table with terrasse etc. Everything was clean and we had just to enjoy. Situated near markets and center of a city with lot of restaurant and also not far with the beach (10 min). But above all  hosts are really perfect  very very kind  they make everything to make you feel at home and enjoy the most your trip! Thanks again to us! PS: if you hesitate to rent a car  don't hesitate anymore  rent one because it's really necessary to be able to discover the island
17869884,Martha September 2017 Amazing hosts  who really take care of their guests. We got the best insider tips from them and our stay would not have been the same without their advice. Also  they look after every detail in the studio  which makes your stay very very comfortable. You won't miss anything and you'll also enjoy the great company of family and friends (including the family's pets  who are adorable!)  while being able to enjoy privacy and calm in the studio at the same time. Can't top this place and its hosts. Response from Anastasia September 2017 Thank you very much Helena and Ben for your kind words  you are great guests and above all great people. We hope that we get a chance to see you again.
17869884,Адель August 2017 If you need feel yourself like home this is the right place to stay on Corfu. It is 100% of your total satisfaction by travel. It is comfortable and nice flat equipped by everything you need to relax   situated not far from the sea  sightseeings but most important is hosted by great family. If I ever come back to Corfu I would love to stay there for the whole trip 🙌
17869884,Althea August 2017 The house of Nicholas and Demetra is very welcoming and intimate. The Hause is located not far from the center of Gouvia and yet easy to reach. Demetra and Nicholas are really exceptional  kind and most helpful. I highly recommend this solution for who  like me  want to experience a wanderful holiday in Corfu. Response from Anastasia August 2017 Thank you very much Althea and Vincenzo  you have been fantastic guests  you are always welcome in our home. We wish you all the best in your life and hope to see you again.
17869884,Karsten August 2017 Nicholas is a very friendly and supporting host  was a pleasure to stay at his place. Response from Anastasia August 2017 Thank you Karsten  we are very happy that you enjoyed your stay at our place.
17869884,Emma August 2017 Nicholas and Demetra were super friendly and helpful for anything from tips for events  places to go or around the house. The place was clean nearby bus station mini market and bigger market like 10 minutes by foot. Me and my sister stayed for over two weeks and we would totally recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Corfu. Response from Anastasia August 2017 Thank you Emma and Barba  we were very fortunate to host you and have you stay with us. We wish you all the best in anything that you do in life and hope to see you again soon. All the best  Demetra and Nicholas.
17869884,Marieke July 2017 The studio was a good place for my friend and me  as the bus connections were great and the essentials (supermarket etc) were in walking distance. The apartment is small  but cozy and has a well equipped kitchen. In the garden there is plenty of space to eat and relax which was great. If you have a low budget this is your place to stay in Korfu! Response from Anastasia July 2017 Thank you Marieke and Filomena  it has been a pleasure having you stay with us. We will be very happy to have host you again some day.
17869884,Kaitlyn July 2017 We had a good stay here  Demetra and Nicholas are absolutely wonderful hosts. They had a problem with their water (something completely uncontrolable for them ) and they handled it so well with booking us a room in a close by hotel  driving us to that hotel and picking us up in Corfu town to bring us to their home. Would recommend!
17869884,Lorimer June 2017 The apartment is lovely  well thought-out  and as shown in the listing. The location is peaceful and pretty  and not more than 5 minutes' walk away from the nearest bus stop - from there  it is a short ride to Corfu Town. There is also a friendly and well-stocked mini-market nearby  from which bus tickets can be bought. (Check bus times in advance  or talk to Maria at the mini-market)  When we arrived  the apartment was spotlessly clean  and contained everything we needed - as well as luxuries such as a ceiling fan  coffee machine  biscuits  and tourist information about the local area. Small touches  such as the soap and shampoo being new and unopened  did not go unnoticed. The garden was beautiful and very pleasant to spend time in  which we were welcomed and encouraged to do - we breakfasted there each morning.  Nicholas and Demetra were very welcoming  knowledgeable about the area  and always contactable. They replied to messages quickly  and were extremely helpful - as hosts  they couldn't have done better  and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Corfu. Show more Response from Anastasia June 2017 Dear Alice and Lorimer  we cannot express how happy we were to have met and hosted you on your holidays in Corfu. We only wish that you had stayed longer so that we could interact more. You both personify what we understand as the perfect Guests (with a capital g)  being enthusiastic  positive  polite  friendly  positive and respectful people. We are sure that  in life  you will succeed in anything you do because you are such awesome people. We wish you all the best in life and hope that we get to see you again some day. P.s. Roxanne says thank you. Show more
17869884,Katerina June 2017 Nicolas and Demetra were very friedly and welcoming hosts. Although the appartment was small  you could find there everything you needed. You could also use the garden belonging to the house. It was just 10 minutes walk from the beach and even less from shops  restaurants or bus station from where you can take a direct city bus to the Corfu town. The town Gouvia is a perfect location for holiday and a good starting point for discovering the island (you can rent a scooter or a car for a good price) Response from Anastasia June 2017 Thank you Katerina and Yann  it has been great meeting you  we hope to see you again some day.
17869884,Anne-Lise June 2017 The place is well situated  quiet. The host gave us great advice to discover the island and were very nice. We found in the studio everything we needed. We recomand you this place! Response from Anastasia June 2017 Thank you very much Anne-Lise and Julie. You have been great guests. We are very happy to have met you and hope that we see you again soon. All the best.
17869884,Isabel October 2022 Super nice studio - in front of the door every day the small cats and a large garden with great olive trees & plenty of seating.

17869884,Martina August 2022 We had a wonderful week at this Studio. The apartment is small  but cozy  well-kept and equipped with everything you need. There is no air conditioning  but the fan is enough to cool the room despite the high summer temperatures. The house is secluded  not far from the main road and bus stops  with a small supermarket nearby. A positive note for the garden  where you can eat  but above all  relax and be with some cats and the owner's dog. Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
17869884,Christian July 2022 very quiet accommodation and friendly and helpful owner Translated from Italian  Show original
17869884,Ana July 2022 From our arrival to our departure  the attention and warmth of Demetra and her family made us feel at home. I wish that was our house because with your advice and recommendations we were able to enjoy the paradise that is Corfu. From the studio in Gouvia you can take buses to almost any part of the island and you will not be missing anything for a perfect stay. There are kittens too ✨❣️😻 Translated from Spanish  Show original
17869884,Χρυσα June 2022 Clean  cozy room  nice backyard  very welcoming owner. Nearby spot on the beaches! Translated from Greek  Show original

17869884,Charlene August 2021 Our stay at Demetra was very pleasant. Demetra was a very good hostess  very accommodating  who gave us good advice to find a beach sheltered from the mass of tourists and good restaurants on the island. The accommodation is as described  well equipped and the terrace as well as the garden were very pleasant by this heat (38°C!).

17869884,Michel September 2020 Anastasia is a generous host who welcomed us with great kindness. The stay in her apartment which overlooks a large garden amid olive trees with plenty of animals  dog cats  chickens and even goats  delighted us. We communicated little because we don't speak English (or Greek) but Anastasia went above and beyond to welcome us. We also enjoyed the treats left in the apartment and the small tomatoes from the garden. Translated from French  Show original
17869884,Liang August 2019 Lucky and happy to live here  the owner is the best host I've ever had!Due to our early flight to Corfu  we arrived at Gouvia around 7 o'clock. After contacting the elder sister  she said that the previous guest left early  and immediately cleaned up for us  made us tea so we could rest in the huge yard  and quickly arranged for us to stay and rest.You can park several cars in the huge yard. Be sure to rent a car when you come to Corfu. Public transportation is not very good here. Be sure to rent a car before you come and pick up at the airport.You need to take a taxi to this house or drive yourself. There is a supermarket chain nearby  which is quite convenient!The town center and the beach are within walking distance  have fun!Thank you very much for taking care of me  I gave a lot of suggestions for places to visit during my stay for a few days  it was very detailed  I had a lot of fun.Definitely stay here if you are coming to Gouvia  5 stars recommended!

17869884,Florent June 2019 Very warm welcome. The hosts take great care. I had a little car problem and they offered to help me with the process. Really nice. The description of the room is completely accurate. House in a quiet area and good location for visiting the island. Bus stop (for Corfu center)  many restaurants and beachfront just a few minutes' walk away. I highly recommend this property! Translated from French  Show original
17869884,Ingrid April 2019 We had a great time. Demetra and Nicholas are very warm  friendly and sunny hosts. They are responsive and attentive to our needs. The room has all the necessary equipment (stove  microwave  iron  hair dryer etc.). Ideally located accommodation for shops and beaches nearby. They have a large garden and a small table where you can eat enjoying the calm and the view. It's nice to live in this Airbnb. To sum up  we had a lovely stay in Corfu! And I can say without a mistake that it would have been less good without the good advice and kindness of our hosts. Thank you to nicoholas and Demetra for this wonderful welcome and for contributing to one of our most beautiful holidays! Translated from French  Show original

The location of the house makes it easy to reach all the sites of the Island that you want to discover. Everything was perfect for us   in every way  throughout our stay! Thanks Nicholaos and Demetra! Translated from French  Show original
17869884,Dominique September 2018 The two hosts are very friendly and above all helpful. Unfortunately  I did not meet them personally  as they were on vacation themselves at the time  but nevertheless everything was very organized and they took care of my concerns very well and above all quickly. I highly recommend staying with the two of them. A very nice house  with lots of small loving details in the apartment. Translated from German  Show original
17869884,Joel September 2018 Ideal location  the village center and beach is a 10-minute walk away as well as all amenities (supermarket)  Corfu is 8 km away   Gouvia is a starting point well located between the north and south... At Nicholas and Demetra's you will find peace ... Well appointed studio and good bedding   a garden with cocooning spaces under the olive trees... You will be at home with the added advice of the nice owners of the place... The morning voice of the rooster will help you wake up and so enjoy a good and pleasant day... However  this one is sometimes in a time difference. Don't trust it too much... I highly recommend this rental: simple  quiet   clean ... A family home whose nicholas and Demetra have opened the doors of their home as well as their heart... Translated from French  Show original

17869884,Stefania August 2018 It was a fantastic vacation  the owner Demetra was super friendly  always available for any type of information. The house is small but very hospitable and very nice  for two people it is perfect. It's not in the exact location shown on the Airbnb map  but in the opposite location. But it's not far from the center of Gouvia  so you can get there right away. Gouvia is a very nice town and is located in the center of the island  between north and south  so it was easy to reach both the north and south of the island. In addition  there are absolutely Pullman that transport you to all the beaches without any problem Translated from Italian  Show original

We were always happy to help you choose the best places to visit in the Coronavirus and if needed  we were always happy to help. This happened when the hot water was running out of hot water for unexpected reasons  but the issue was resolved immediately. Cute and doable people  convenient for everyday trips  close to Kerkyra  close to the beach  easy to get to and from the island. We had a car  and it was an extra amenity. We were in October  but it's definitely a small garden in the summer where you can eat. Equipped to spend a pleasant vacation and be self-sufficient.

3981629,Ross October 2022 What a special place  everyone of our family loved it and had a fabulous holiday. Gerasimos has not only thought of everything that a great place needs  but his generous helpful way  meant that if we needed guidance on anything  he was there to advise us. Brilliant communication throughout booking  check -in  during the stay and on departure. Thanks Gerasimos 👍
3981629,Harriet August 2022 I was here for a week with my partner and my two children and their partners. We had a blissful time. The house is amazing  made of glass and in a stunning location on a small cliff overlooking the sea. The swimming pool a generous size so you can swim lengths. All three bedrooms have fabulous sea views and enjoy the afternoon sun. The house is surrounded by delightful grass lawns. The beach is a ten minute walk away but along a narrow cliff path which we found a bit off putting.Maybe we were unlucky with the weather but we found the beach a bit windy. If you want the warm  calm sea associated with Greece  there are a number of beaches with tavernas and sun loungers a twenty minute drive away. Those areas are more built up. It is lovely to return to the house which is set in far more rural  unspoilt surroundings including a lagoon with flamingoes. There are excellent tavernas a five minute walk from the house for dinner. There is a small supermarket about a ten minute drive which has most things but often hidden away. You have to ask or have a good rummage. Gerasimos could not have been kinder or more helpful and made sure we had an absolutely delightful stay.
3981629,Michael July 2022 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay (two families with young children). Perfect villa for a relaxed holiday - pool is fantastic and so nice to be close to the sea (note the villa doesn’t have direct access  you need to walk 5 mins to Taverna Alonaki to access).  Gerasimos is a fantastic host. The villa is in a rural part of Corfu which has its advantages (away from crowds  quiet  beautiful and very authentic) but disadvantages (nearest supermarket is 15-20 mins drive away and in truth  the offering is pretty poor and for a full shop  you need to go to Lidl (30 mins drive away)). However  Gerasimos kindly offered to go to the fish market for us and it didn’t affect our enjoyment at all.  There is a really good beach bar (Tayo)  5 mins drive away at Halikounas beach and Taverna Alonaki is very walkable offering basic fare but a good spot for lunch.  We would definitely recommend! Response from Gerasimos July 2022 Dear Michael  First  we would like to thank all of you  for selected our villa to spend yours relaxing break away holiday in Corfu  for the next season we plan to build steps leading direct access from the villa to the beach. Hope to welcome you all again .... BR Gerasimos Show more
3981629,Yannick June 2022 We had a wonderful time at the villa. Everything was very clean  house as well as outside area is beautiful and the contact with the landlord was very very friendly and uncomplicated. The huge garden invites to all kinds of sports and the pool is also perfect for a summer vacation. We can totally recommend a vacation in this AirBnB. Response from Gerasimos June 2022 Thank you very much for your kind words  you are always welcome in our villa.
3981629,Cristian April 2022 Gerasimos' place was absolutely wonderful. The view is incredible  and everything looks brand new. Totally recommend it!
3981629,Chen July 2021 Stunning villa in a great location close to beautiful tavernas. The villa is top notch. Everything new and super clean. We loved the spacious and modern design. Gerasimos was a great host - always available and helpful. He even brought us fresh bread and fish to BBQ. We can definitely recommend this villa! Thanks Gerasimos.
3981629,Matt June 2021 This is an incredible villa and an even better host! Gerasimos was there for everything we needed and every question asked. The views from the pool and terrace are amazing  and the outside space is perfect for a big group or a family. The villa is private and secluded  the pool and house are new and well maintained with great finishings. We've stayed in many Airbnb's and this is our favourite!
3981629,Jessica September 2020 Our stay at Gerasimos villa was amazing. The villa is stunning  very modern  designed and decorated to a very high standard. The kitchen is very well equipped. We had everything we needed to make several meals there. The views from the villa are gorgeous  the outside area and pool are fantastic. The sunsets from the villa were beautiful  such a great spot.The beds are very comfortable  bathrooms modern and showers are great. It is really nice to have each room with an ensuite when travelling as a group of couples. The villa is a little far out but this was fine for us and it was only a short drive from more tourstiy areas. I would definitely suggest hiring a car to get to supermarkets etc. There are a few nice traditional restaurants within walking distance  as well as a beach bar. The lake and beach are very nice to walk along. The area was very peaceful with lots of birds   including flamingos on the near by lake. Gerasimos was a very good host. Quick communication and very helpful. He met us at the airport on arrival and took us to a supermarket the next day. He also came over when we had any issue and to bring us firelighters for the bbq at short notice. He also left some very thoughtful treats for our arrival. I would highly recommend the villa and we would love to stay again. Thank you Gerasimos Show more
3981629,Christian June 2017 In early June 2017 we have spent a fantastic week in Corfu. Our entire family (three children) loved the spacious and heated pool  the nearby beaches  the scenic view  the smell of wild flowers  the absence of any street noise and the extremely well taken care of properity and facilities. To complete the picture upon arrival we were greeted at the airport by Gerasimos' nephew who guided us all the way to our house. A clear recommendation for anyone seeking a place for the family that is off the beaten track whilst offering all modern amenities and that comes with a fantastic view over the Adriatic sea. Response from Gerasimos June 2017 Dear Mr Mayert   Thank you for your lovely review.  B.R. Gerasimos Show more
3981629,Kim October 2016 This is a beautiful villa  and although it is off the beaten track  it did not disappoint. The sunset view every evening was stunning  and having the sea in such a short distance for a swim was lovely. Our host was very accommodating and helpful  and the local village nearby has an AMAZING butcher and grocery store  especially if you want a glimpse of how the locals live. It was not touristy at all which is what we wanted. You 100% need a car (and sat nav - I used my phone) and Corfu has lots to see and do if you're confident enough to brave the roads. I'd highly recommend checking out Prasudi beach which is nearby (very small and quiet beach with a taverna overlooking the sea) and visiting Archontiko restaurant. Taxis were also great around this area.
3981629,Maik October 2022 The villa is 100% the same as the beautiful pictures and can do even more. Both from the two bedrooms on the ground floor and from the 2nd floor there is a wonderful view over the ocean and also from the large pool deck with lots of loungers you can enjoy the sunset. The pool itself is really large and not only suitable for splashing  but also really suitable for swimming. In addition  the heat pump here has real power: despite mild temperatures at the end of October  the water was actually 28-29 degrees warm at all times. The property of the villa is huge and offers plenty of space to romp for the kids  games room in the basement  see-saw and swing as well as outdoor shower have delighted the younger ones very much. The Jacuzzi shown in the listing was not yet ready for use  but we did not miss it at all. Within walking distance you will find a very good and family-friendly tavern and it is also only a 15-minute walk to the wonderfully long sandy beach. Nevertheless  a car here is just as mandatory as a mosquito net for the bed  because the adjacent lake ensures many mosquitoes and the villa is about 15 minutes from the nearest town. Gerasimos was an excellent host who personally welcomed and said goodbye to us and always helped us. Translated from German  Show original
3981629,Jannik May 2022 The house is breathtakingly beautiful and is quietly located right by the sea. A tavern is also just around the corner. The landlord is very nice and accommodating and is there for any question (rent a scooter/boat etc.) or problem. The house itself is newly built and accordingly also modernly equipped and furnished. The pool is very large and invites you to relax and bathe. Kitchen equipped with new appliances as well as TV (international channels  many German channels) and Wi-Fi in each room. If you are looking for absolute relaxation and a quiet stay with a carefree package  this is the place to be. Anytime again. Translated from German  Show original
14793468,Oli October 2022 This was a fantastic villa. The views are beautiful  the place is spotless  and the facilities are amazing. Would definitely go back!
14793468,Lisa September 2022 Everything we had hoped for and more. The Villa is stunning. The views the terraces and pool are incredible and we spent every spare minute outside. The interior is also stunning. A spacey interior  spotlessly clean with every convenience. Spiros was a great host. Warm and friendly and everything worked like clockwork. If there was a 6 star rating  I would have given more stars.
14793468,Marcel September 2022 Really nice villa  unbelievable view!
14793468,David June 2022 What a lovely stay we had at Algeos Villa. Seven adults stayed and the accommodation was perfect for us - four double rooms  two with en suites and a bathroom for the other two to share. There’s a roof terrace that has amazing views out to the southwest. The pool is in the sun all day so remains quite warm and the views from the pool area and the terrace are very memorable! There are parasols to shade yourselves at the pool and plenty of little areas to take yourself out of the sun if it becomes relentless. The pool is more than big enough for seven adults (or more!) to muck about in together. Pictures don’t do the place justice. It’s really clean and really spacious. The welcome pack was lovely  they left some wine  water and treats for us! Big fridge freezer to store the necessities and a dishwasher for ease. Good driveway for secure off road parking if you have a car  we got a pre-booked taxi there  which worked well for us. Barbati town is a ten minute walk from the villa and it’s another three or four mins to the beach from there. Barbati town has all you need for your conveniences - beer  wine  food  souvenirs. Plus restaurants and bars aplenty. Scala was a lovely cocktail bar and our restaurant was called Dionosis’ - Greek grub with excellent service and good but inexpensive wine (relatively speaking). All in all a very pleasurable stay! Show more
14793468,Marc October 2021 WOW! This place looked amazing from the photographs and thankfully the reality completely lived up to that. We had a fantastic time. The house is spacious comfortable and in a perfect location. You are a short walk down to the village or down to the beach if you want to go for a swim in the sea. There was good internet connectivity as I had to do a days work while we were there and host a Zoom meeting which worked fine. The swimming pool was lovely and very nice to sit beside and there was even another sunbathing area overlooking the pool where you are kind of sitting on a ledge on the side of a mountain. Everything worked and there was an extremely nice chap called Spiros who was there to welcome us  organise cleaners and check us out at the end and to answer any questions we had. Definitely our best Airbnb experience to date!
14793468,Simon September 2021 We had a fantastic stay in the villa. It has wonderful views and the house is stunning.
14793468,Antoine August 2021 Overall  not the best experience. Communication wasn't really pleasant with the owners. Though there were definite positive aspects like good wifi and great views and the pool wasn't over chlorinated  which is great. Here are a few issues we had.  The dishwasher was broken almost the entire time we had rented the property. We were continually told a repair person was coming and then on that day they would tell us it would be another five days  right before our move out. We had to really press it  but we were grateful to have the issue fixed before we checked out (after multiple emails).  The house manager told us the time the cleaners would come for a mid-week clean at 11am  they showed up a lot earlier  waking us up  so we never got the mid-week cleaning.  There is NOT a lot of natural light inside the house and the ceilings are very low  especially for a modern house  which exacerbates the small living\community area  the only area where all of your people could be together. It is so small that the only furniture is white fabric couch and a glass dining room table. So there’s not enough places for people to sit comfortably if they don’t want to sit at the dining table.  None of the furniture faces the view so when you’re sitting here looking at a wall  not outside. The couch has 2 stained Ottomans that have blankets thrown over them. The only big bedroom is upstairs and shares a toilet with the main floor (everyone). Two of the bedrooms are the size of the bed (small)  only important if you're splitting with friends though. You think you'll stay outside the entire time so it doesn't matter  except...  The direct sun and lack of umbrellas outside make it a little challenging to sit at any tables outside  along with swarms of bees that have infested the outside area  chairs and the pool area. Spiro the house manager was kind and did try to fix the problem  but bees are a real issue and you can't take any food or drinks outside.  Our first day we jumped into the pool and had more than 20-30 bees swarming above our heads. Since there is no furniture inside the house where you can really enjoy the view outside  we tried to have our meals outside and we were joined by more than 1-2 dozen bees. We think they might have a permanent nest in the tree in front of the pool. It’s understandable to have a few bees around you outside (it's Corfu)  but 15 at one time is a bit much. Even without food  we were running from bees most of the time. The outdoor wooden dining set is partially broken; we were told we couldn't place an umbrella in the middle. It made it very difficult to enjoy the outside  impossible to eat outside  and the inside gets very little natural light.  It's important to mention that there is a 3-story unfinished apartment building directly behind the house  that contributes to a lack of privacy from the corner units (the view of the pool) and noise in the evenings.   I would ask for a later check out. It's 10am and we were told it was firm because the cleaners needed the 5 hours to clean before the next guests  but there were no cleaners by 11am  and we had to wait on the house manager to arrive almost an hour after 'check out'. We could've slept another hour and not rushed so much. Spiro the house manager is great  but always runs about 40-50 minutes late each time he said he needed to stop by  only important if you're waiting on him before you leave.  Great Things: The bees go away around 9pm when it gets dark (in August)  so that was a plus. The outdoor area is lovely  and the kitchen is well equipped  if you don't need the dishwasher which Spiro told us is really temperamental. The AC worked great in the bedrooms. The area is close to the Northeast beaches and 40 minutes from the famous Paleokastritsa beaches. Explore all the beaches north of the villa. I think we hit them all.  Show more
14793468,Sybille August 2021 Beautiful modern house with incredible views and very comfortable amenities. Breakfasts on the terrace priceless. The Long warm evenings looking over the sea will stay in our memories. 1km (15min walk) from the beach. Small Supermarket 10 min walk away The area is conviennent but need a car to go around anyway.
14793468,Rob September 2020 Phenomenal villa  we will be back
14793468,Bing August 2020 We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful villa. Everything is perfect: amazing view  infinity pool  plenty of outside space. Blue flag Barbati beach is a short drive away. Nearby Taverna Akrogiali offers very nice seafood. Spiros is very helpful and offered lots of useful local tips. Can’t wait to return this fantastic place!
14793468,Sandra September 2019 What a stunning home - it is even more beautiful in person! The kitchen is well stocked  the outdoor spaces fabulous. Highly recommend. We would also recommend having a car as it is a bit of a walk to the beach and restaurants  especially at night. The owners are so helpful and answer questions quickly. There are lots of delightful restaurants right in Barbati - you will not have to go far.
14793468,Rob August 2019 Fantastic villa   great location also very private . All mod cons ... everything covered . We had small children 18 m which was a bit of a struggle as not toddler friendly but says so in the review . Spiros the host is great guy very helpful!! Christine/ Spiros arranged a babysitter for which was fantastic and the lady was lovely and great with the children. All round great place !! Rob
14793468,Fiona July 2019 You will love this house! The view is spectacular. The house and pool are wonderful. Spiros met us at the house  even though we didn't arrive until 11.30pm and he was super helpful throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble and he responded quickly to any queries we had. Cleaners came in every 4 days which was perfect. Highly recommend.

14793468,Alex August 2018 Spiros was a fantastic help. A very nice property & house made it a very enjoyable holiday. Thank you
14793468,Michelle July 2018 The setting was stunning and the villa was beautiful...those views!! It exceeded expectations and was much more spacious than anticipated. The hosts also helpfully organised an extra travel cot at short notice. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend to others.  It might be helpful to be aware that the road to the village is quite dangerous to walk on as it's very narrow with no lighting or footpaths. There is a stepped pathway down which comes out by the Lord Byron which is a helpful shortcut but it's difficult with prams. It would be fine if adult only party but may be helpful to know!  It was great to have the cooking and BBQ facilities but without a car it was difficult to shop for supplies.  The above is not a fault of the villa but it might be helpful to know these details.  Spiros  our contact whilst there was very nice - welcoming and helpful.  The welcome gifts were a thoughtful addition and much appreciated!  Thank you for sharing your stunning home! Show more

14793468,Francis October 2017 It's quite rare to find a place to stay that truly exceeds your expectations. This is definitely one. The villa is beautiful  and the views are outstanding. The owners and  when at the villa  Spiros  were very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Local restaurants  on and near the seafront  were great and just a very short drive away. 30hp boats were available for hire on the local beach (do negotiate the price down) and made a fabulous day out  dropping into one of the waterside restaurants for lunch  where someone always comes out to help you 'park' the boat at the jetty.  A memorable stay. Response from Christine & Daniel October 2017 Dear Francis   A big thank you for your comments which we will take into account. A heating for the pool will be placed for next year probably by a heat pump system.  Beach towels will be available from May 2018.  I will check the safe box and its closure system as it had no problem before.  we thank you for your comments which allow us to improve ourselves in order to satisfy our guests better.  We are delighted that you have a good holiday in the villa and we sincerely hope to welcome you again during one of your future stays.  Best regards  Christine & Daniel Show more

14793468,Peter July 2017 Just an amazing place. Great views  a beautiful home  great restaurants nearby and easy to get around with a vehicle We loved our stay
14793468,Catherine August 2022 Very nice house  very nice with different small outdoor corners that allow you to have shade at all hours and isolate yourself if you are several families. The house is convenient  well-equipped  the pool is very nice because it's a good size. The view from the house to the sea is breathtaking. The beach is within walking distance for adults or teenagers. For children you have to go by car (barely 2 minutes) and 8 minutes on foot because the ascent is steep but really doable for adults or teenagers. Close by supermarkets and restaurants. Shingle beach with beautifully clear water below the house. By car you can go on excursions from other parts of the island in 30 to 40 minutes. Translated from French  Show original

44000470,Chris August 2022 House is very comfortable and modern. House sits on a cliff side so expect a lot of steps and a very steep driveway. Once inside it is worth while with beautiful views.

44000470,Nicole June 2022 Absolutely incredible stay at Villa Faiax. We were a group of 6 and we couldn’t fault anything at all - the villa is so beautiful - even more beautiful than the pictures somehow! We had welcome gifts from the villa host to get us started which was so handy  as we could immediately get on with our holiday instead of having to do a trip to the store! Rooms were spacious  plenty storage  plenty towels and shower rooms lovely. They also provide you with an app with recommendations for the area which we found really useful. The views are just stunning and it’s a great location  ideal for walking into Ipsos and there’s a couple of restaurants on the way down which we’re so nice and welcoming (especially Le Grand Balcon) Overall absolutely fantastic stay and would recommend to anyone travelling as a group. Thank you so much!
44000470,Fern September 2020 An absolutely stunning  amazing villa which made our holiday even better! The food and drink which was left was a very nice welcoming touch and the WhatsApp messages to check in and if we needed anything was also very kind and useful to help book trips ect. The views from this villa was incredible  including the pool. And the villa was secure and modern. We also used the bbq facilities numerous times throughout our stay. The villas location was exceptional and only a short walk down the hill to the bars and restaurants. Overall we will defiantly recommend this villa!!! :)
44000470,Jayne July 2020 Fabulous villa with amazing views. We had a wonderful holiday & would certainly recommend. We hope to return!

25670803,Amy August 2022 Tomasz’s house was great for our family—comfortable  well equipped and beautiful inside and out. Very clean too! Arillas is a fantastic destination if you don’t like crowds  but want good food and a friendly atmosphere. Highly recommend!
25670803,Niels August 2022 We had a great time. The accommodation was great!  A few mosquitoes have annoyed us but the view was just a dream. We will gladly come back and can recommend the accommodation 100%.
25670803,Maria May 2022 Fantastic stay in the villa! Would recommend to anyone who wants a nice peaceful stay in Corfu
25670803,Zoheir August 2021 A lovely modern villa on a hill  very well equipped  all clean and new  pleasure to stay in. Gorgeous swimming pool which the whole family enjoyed. A short 15 minute walk away from the beautiful sandy beach of Arillas. Daizy was extremely helpful and kind  explained to us where to shop and helped us arrange a taxi for a discounted price. We had a very relaxing  wonderful stay.
25670803,Svetlana September 2018 Beautiful view and sunset view! Gorgeous views from the bed  shower and living room. Design is exquisite and all amenities are included. Located on a steep hill but includes a parking spot. Overlooking Arillas and the beach in the distance. Around a 15 minute walk to the beach  bakery  little market and pizza restaurant (Litheros). 7 minute walk to a delicious fish restaurant (Vavilas).

25670803,Jérôme August 2021 The accommodation is very good  clean  well arranged  with enough accessories for the kitchen  the setting is magnificent with a beautiful view  the pool is very nice too  but there were no accessories (mattress  float...). We gave 3 stars  that's because we had the whole time  every day from 10: 00am  the noises of a construction site in front of the house (noises from tractopelles moving stones to access a construction site in a future house) . Also  we didn't really feel at home because the people in the maintenance of the house (pool  water tank...) returned without informing us of their visit sometimes several times a day. We would have accepted it if we had not paid as much for our stay sold to be very quiet and independent. Translated from French  Show original
25670803,Andrea October 2018 We had a great five days in the Hillside Villa and felt very comfortable in the cozy house. The villa is very quiet at the end of a cul-de-sac with great views of nature and the sea. Shops and restaurants are a 20-minute walk away. The house is still very new  very tasteful and furnished with attention to detail and equipped with everything we need (washing machine is not available against the description  but we did not miss it). The mattress may be softer for my taste  but that's what everyone feels different. Communication before and during the stay was also very good (exact directions  early check-in possible  easy key handover and quick response to questions). The construction site next door was also closed on request for the duration of our stay  so we could fully enjoy the hours in the house and in the pool. Overall  highly recommended! Translated from German  Show original Response from Tomasz October 2018 Dear Andrea  We are glad that you liked the house.  Your review will help us provide more detailed information to our guests. Because there is a laundry room in the basement of the house that you probably missed. The entrance is behind the house from the garden side. We will immediately put the information about this with the exact description of the room in the information folder. Many thanks for your review and note. Show more Translated  Show original
27677531,Rachel September 2022 Villa Solitude really does live up to its name  the stunning views and peaceful location makes it the perfect place to relax and unwind! Sofia went above and beyond before we even arrived in Corfu  giving us recommendations for places to eat and visit which came in very handy when we arrived as we had a plan of places to visit/eat straight away! We arrived on a Sunday  without thinking about the fact that supermarkets wouldn’t be open - Sofia made sure that we had breakfast for our arrival which was so kind of her! The villa really is so beautiful  the balcony overlooking the pool and the view of the sea - sitting on the balcony having a morning coffee and watching the sunrise was incredible. I could not fault anything about Villa Solitude or Corfu  the Villa has to be the most amazing place I have stayed so far  I couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you so much Sofia we will definitely be returning in the future 😃 Response from Sofia September 2022 Dear Rachel  Thank you so much for your kind words and thank you all for being such excellent guest.

27677531,Alex August 2022 Our two families adored our week at Villa Solitude. It's a beautiful house with lots of quiet  private spaces in which to relax and read  but bags of room to come together for noisy fun. With the swimming pool  table tennis and pool table  the teenagers were thoroughly entertained for the week. Sofia and George were perfect hosts with excellent recommendations for local beaches and restaurants. But it was the views from the terrace which will stay with me for a lifetime. Highly recommended.

They clearly want everyone who rents the property to have the best stay they can.  The downstairs living area is vast  the rooms are large and airy. The pool is awesome. It was great having the use of a table tennis and pool table. Kids were never off them.  This is the first time we have taken our disabled girl abroad as a family. The house was absolutely perfect. Large doors downstairs. Wheelchair lift to get into and out of the house. Large wet room in the ensuite downstairs was superb.  There were absolutly no down points about this property. We loved our holiday at Gazatika and we loved Sofia and her family.

27677531,Rhiannon September 2020 The villa is exactly as pictured! Amazing sun rise and location up the mountain is great - the name of the villa is very apt  it is very remote but worth it for the views! Not too far from the old town or other towns and villages but a rental car is essential. Sofia was an amazing host and very helpful throughout our stay at Villa Solitude  right from the moment we met her at the airport until check out. Would really recommend saying here.
27677531,Magdalena August 2020 Sofia is an unusual host. She cares very much about the clients. She always advised and helped. She even bought us some shopping at the beginning of our arrival. The villa is located in a quiet place  away from the sounds of the city  but it was close to everywhere. We travel all over Europe  and this place  thanks to Sofia's hospitality  was the best.  We will definitely come back there.
27677531,Leonie August 2020 A beautiful villa in a perfect setting. We loved the calmness and tranquility of the house. The stunning views from the pool and decking did not disappoint.

They were friendly  considerate and helpful and their warmth and hospitality really added to our whole holiday experience. We hope to be back one day!
27677531,Dave October 2019 A beautiful house in a secluded yet centrally located part of the island. We found the pool and the views absolutely spectacular and the house was majestic and spacious. We were amazed by Sophia’s gracious hospitality and knowledge of the area. This may be one of the best spots on the entire island of Corfu. Any guest will be lucky to stay here.
27677531,Peter October 2019 We stayed in Villa Solitude for one week in October 2019. It is a perfect place to relax in a quiet surrounding. The house is very clean and comfortable  the pool is wonderful and we used it a lot (like the table tennis game). The kitchen is equipped with all necessary things (even a dishwasher).  The villa is only a short drive from Corfu Airport in the mountains of Dassia. You would definitly need a car to get there - and make sure it is not a sports car. From the terrace you can enjoy the views of the sea  the Albanian coastline  the old fortress of Corfu  the port of Corfu and much more. The nice beaches of Paleokastritsa  Glyfada  Kassiopi  Timoni  Sidari and Cape Drastis can easily reached by car.  Sophia gave us a very warm welcome at Corfu Airport and made a first quicky roundtrip with us by car through the streets of old town Corfu. She went with us to the villa and gave us a friendly introduction to the house. Moreover  she did some shopping for us for the first breakfast because we arrived on a sunday - thanks for that.

27677531,Mia October 2018 Villa Solitude is astonishing  peaceful  retreat for those looking to relax and enjoy time away from it all in Corfu. Its decor reflects a provencal Mediterranean style with its distinctive Greek touches. The house is nestled in a beautiful elevation that allows views of the Ionian sea; complementing the setting you find a magnificent infinity heated pool. The outdoor decking furnishings are of very high quality  our kids enjoyed very much the ping-pong table and the billiard pool. The accommodation is definitely top-notch  a home away from home. Villa solitude provided our family with everything to make our holiday one-of-a-kind memory. We definitely  recommend this property to anyone.  Anne
27677531,Liane September 2022 The villa is elevated with magnificent views of the sea and mountains. The path there is adventurous in some places but still manageable. You live very quietly and yet are in the city or by the sea in no time. The interior is very nicely designed and everything is sufficiently available (except coffee spoons) for dishes  electrical appliances  etc. The beds could be a little more comfortable as needed. The outdoor area is super nice with a large table  the large pool (very well maintained) and the sufficient loungers. However  we would have liked a little more shade in the greatest heat. We would like to praise and thank you to the super nice host Sofia and her husband  who were always available and provided us with helpful information and tips. That's why we can highly recommend a vacation at Villa Solitude. Translated from German  Show original
27677531,Siegfried June 2022 Sofia is truly a touching host. Since we had a small baby with us  she took care of the umbrella  crib and baby chair. She was also quick to answer any other questions and support us. The house is really very exposed with a wonderful view to Albania and Kerkyra city. The only note: there are too few shade areas around the house. We were there in very hot temperatures - and then it became difficult to be outside together. But otherwise: a really great place. Translated from German  Show original
27677531,Michela July 2021 Villa Solitude is a beautiful villa just a 15-minute drive from Ypsos and 25 from Corfu. The road to the beach is a little tricky  but Sofia was so kind to join us for the first time  pointing us to the best way to get there. The spaces are great for groups of people and the house is also suitable for a group of guys. In addition  the interior of the house is very well equipped and the kitchen is well stocked.

23134805,Alice September 2022 We had a great stay at Petros’ villa. Petros was welcoming and accommodating and the villa was the perfect size for a group of 15 of us. We rented a small car to get to the shops and then used Corfu Minibus Transfers to get around for day trips  as well as having the 20 minute public bus into Corfu Town.  Only small flaw  which cannot be helped as pavements are sparse in Corfu  is that the villa is on a main road which makes walking a little difficult until you reach a pavement 200m down the road.  Petros very kindly drove us to do a big shop on the first day to get us settled in and also sent in cleaners halfway through which was a lovely touch. The pool area and sunset view was just lovely and I would recommend staying here.
23134805,Matt August 2022 Incredible villa with great pool  cold AC  and a great location! Petros is an incredible host and provided so much more than the average airbnb experience. Highly recommend for groups or families
23134805,Emma August 2022 We had the most wonderful stay. Petros went above and beyond to meet all our expectations and to make our holiday 1 to remember!
23134805,Joanna June 2022 La Villa E Besta was the perfect place for our group of 14 from around the world to get together and reconnect and to explore Corfu. We loved it! Petros was a fantastic host. Made us delicious moussaka for the night of our arrival and was quick to respond to any and all requests for information. Super experience. Will definitely return one day! Response from Petros June 2022 We are more than happy you and your friends had a great time!!! We hope to see you again some day!!!
23134805,Isobel September 2019 Petros was an outstanding host! His villa was absolutely beautiful and perfect for my hen do celebration.

I would highly recommend this villa to anyone who is visiting Corfu. I cannot wait to visit again one day! Thank you
23134805,Candice July 2019 Fabulous accommodation and views with a great beach close by - not overcrowded! Flats are so well equipped for self catering  and Petros was very thoughtful in leaving some home made local meals which were thoroughly enjoyed by our group.
23134805,Jo June 2019 Petros was a fabulous host and couldn't do enough for us  recommended local restaurants  caterers  taxi companies and made bookings for our group of 12 ahead of our arrival. The villa is beautiful  with a gorgeous pool. Lots of steps though  so worth considering if you are less able in any way. We had biscuits from Petros' mother and homemade ice cream  with other local treats and the sea view is incredible. It is probably 15 mins walk to Benitses  but half of the walk has no path  so you do really need a car or a local cab to get about. Also get an automatic car rather than manual as the driveway up to the villa is steep! I'd definitely recommend Belle Vista for a group of friends or extended family holiday  it was spacious  air con  well equipped and quiet! Thank you Petros xx
23134805,Alek June 2019 A great location for a team building event! The villas were really great but the pool was spectacular and Petros was very helpful the entire time. Memories we will keep forever. Thanks Petros!
23134805,Sarah June 2019 We had a wonderful stay in this villa! Petros is a fantastic host  who got back to us on any questions we had immediately  had a lovely welcome pack and helped us arrange taxis and excursions. The villa/ three apartments was perfect for our big family group. The views of the sea where beautiful  the villa had all the amenities you would need for a stay and the amazing pool and sports pitch kept everyone entertained. We had lots of BBQs on the balcony overlooking the sea but there was also a great selection of restaurants 15/20 mins walk from the villa in Benitses. We had a great stay! Thank you Petros!
23134805,Борис October 2018 Grate place! Highly recommend
23134805,Rudy September 2018 Petros has a truly lovely villa. The house is actually 3 apartments. Thye each have all the amenities you would expect and Petros adds some nice touches by buying in water  milk  eggs and a few special extra treats ti help make you feel at home. The pool area is the highlight and has great views and is an awesome space to entertain and relax. Petros is also very responsive and willing to help with local tips and any other issues. He sets the bar for Airbnb hosts.
23134805,Martina July 2018 We stayed for a week at La Vista e Bella and had a fantastic stay. Petros was an outstanding host and his responses were very prompt. He left us a welcome pack  which was amazing and contained everything we needed and lots of other additional things. We enjoyed our cheese pie and our chicken pie  which he thoughtfully left in the freezer for us! The house was clean and well supplied. Lots of nice additions too  like indoor and outdoor games and PS4. Petros was there to offer advice on places to go and restaurant recommendations  which we tried and had lovely food. The pool was amazing  particularly at night. I would definitely recommend La Vista e Bella and Petros was an outstanding host.
23134805,Chris June 2018 As we were the first family to stay in the newly revamped villa I feel an obligation to do a slightly longer review than normal. Location: The villa is 15 minutes south of the airport (10 mins no traffic  20 mins at rush hour) so perfect for pick-ups if your group is arriving on different flights. It sits on the east coast overlooking the sea and just outside Benitses which just happens to be one of the nicest villages we visited  with a small beach  lots of life and plenty of shops and great tavernas. The best beaches are on the west side but our favourite was only a 26 min drive along an easy road door to sand. The villa: It has seven bedrooms but is actually divided into three self contained apartments each with their own kitchen and living space. Two apartments are mirror images and contain three beds and two bathrooms. The third is a one bed apartment. You can open it up to be one huge villa or separate into three if different members of your group want privacy so wonderfully flexible. The pool: This is a highlight. We were the first to use it but the whole pool area is simply stunning. The pool is just the right size for a decent swim and equally perfect for playing or relaxing. It is set in a stone terrace with open shower  really comfortable sunbeds  plenty of shades and a separate sundeck. There is also a dining table on the terrace if you want to eat there. The terrace itself is elevated at the rear of the villa with commanding views over the sea towards the Greek mainland. Simple heaven. Amenities: There are lots. Parking for I would say four cars. A outdoor but shaded balcony with two more dining tables  BBQ  fully equipped kitchens  TVs  air conditioning  games console  electric piano. Bedrooms and bathrooms are all lovely with classy toiletries and towels provided. Internet: Fast enough to stream a HD movie but the great thing about it is the mesh wifi which means you can wander around the whole property and even out to the pool area and your device will keep connecting to the nearest wifi point. Security: The property is gated which is probably all you need to know - but each apartment also has high security locks and there are safes in each too. The owner: Saved the best until last. Petros has invested significantly in the property and clearly takes a pride in his service and really wants you to have a good time. He is really trying to make sure guests have the perfect holiday and you can tell each visitor experience will be better than the one before as he continues to make improvements. He is not at all intrusive but when he advertises 24/7 concierge service that is what he means. I communicated with him via Facebook Messenger and he usually responded within a few minutes  with help and... Show more
23134805,Elisa May 2022 The villa is a dream! Lots of space for the whole group (we were 14 people)  clean  great view  walking distance to the nearest beach  pool for great pool parties and much more. The communication was very good and Petros is a great host! So 100% recommended! Translated from German  Show original Response from Petros May 2022 Thank you so much Elisa! You were excellent guests too!!!
23134805,Julie-Charlotte May 2019 Petros was an outstanding host with lots of recommendations  he helped us find everything we needed for a pleasant stay. The house is very well located facing the sea  clean and perfectly equipped. Everything comes together for an unforgettable time. Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Sabine September 2022 Amazing stay with Mariana - thank you so much for letting us stay in your lovely bnb. Perfect location very close to the beach and away from town so very peaceful. 2 minute walk from the sea and short walk from lots of restaurants and tavernas which make for a perfect Greek experience!
4118512,Matilda September 2022 My friend and I booked Mariana’s studio for 10 days. Mariana and her family were welcoming from the minute we arrived and were always there when we had a question.  Everything from the setting  to the location was perfect. The view from the front door was even better than the pictures  and being located just a short 3 minute walk to a quiet  shielded beach was very useful. The local town was only a ten minute walk away  with plenty of restaurants  shops and bars to choose from. One of our favourite parts of our whole stay was the bus system. We didn’t have a car or a scooter  so found the bus which takes you directly in to Corfu town  Lidl or the main bus station exceptionally useful. From the green bus station  which is just half an hour from the house  you can get buses all over the island  stopping at all the main beaches and resorts. If you don’t want to rent a car  the buses are a perfect alternative.  Overall  we loved our stay here and recommend it to anyone looking at coming to Corfu.
4118512,Clémentine August 2022 Mariana is a fantastic host  we had a very great time in Corfou.
4118512,Lieve August 2022 Amazing view!! Small apartment but it has everything you need. It’s a short walk to Benitses town  where you can find nice restaurants and bars. The beach is super close  and Mariana also cleaned the apartment during our stay which was super nice! Would definitely recommend  especially for the view and the cats 🐈🌊
4118512,Sarah-Lou August 2022 Nice view  good location and helpful host. But the bathroom is quiet old with the sewage smell and the bed is uncomfortable.
4118512,Ragnhild August 2022 Very cosy apartment! The host is very helpful.
4118512,Lara July 2022 The stay at Marianas studios was awesome. The studio is so nice and the place is beautiful. We can totally recommend it.
4118512,Luisa July 2022 Mariana‘s place is really beautiful and the view from the terrace is absolutely amazing. You definitely need a scooter to explore the island and while some of the routes to the beautiful beaches on the west coast were a bit long  there was still plenty to discover without driving too long distances. Mariana was a perfect host and although the studio is very small  it is worth the money!
4118512,"Andra July 2022 Perfect location for a nice little studio surrounded by nature and the famous ""Corfu cats"". Mariana is a sweet and helpful host."
4118512,Ethan June 2022 Great place to stay  has all the basic necessities needed for a great trip. Good location as bars and shops only a walking distance with the beach also nearby.
4118512,Emily May 2022 Mariana's place was in a beautiful location  and she was very accommodating for checking in and out  as well as very responsive.
4118512,Jared May 2022 Mariana is an excellent host  very quick to respond and helpful with providing directions to where you need to go. Air bnb was clean and comfortable as advertised. Highly recommend staying with her!
4118512,Sean April 2022 Had a lovely stay. Mariana was super helpful and communicative.
4118512,Heidi April 2022 Great place  beautiful terrace with sea view. Small appartment  but enough for two and very clean. Mariana is a great host  very helpfull  giving advices for bus  car rental  good places and transfer to the airport. The communication was perfect  she offert more blankets for cold nights and gave us all what was necessary. Mariana and her family were very friendly  we recommand a stay in their Studios  only 5 Minutes from the beach. Thanks a lot.
4118512,Clem October 2021 The view is so perfect at the morning !
4118512,Alisa September 2021 Perfect place to stay in Corfu. We loved the terrace with the beautiful sea view to watch the sunrises and sunsets. Mariana is a very nice host and she was so helpful with everything and the communication went perfect. She helped us with the transfer to the airport  recommended very good places to eat and to swim and gave us all the necessary things that we needed. The airbnb is perfectly located  it has a very close beach (during the day there was almost no one else) and tavernas  supermarket and bars are within walking distance. It was very peaceful and beautiful and we felt like in a paradise of flowers  sun and sea. We are thankful for the perfect week and would go there any time again! xo
4118512,Johann September 2021 was perfect
4118512,Elsa September 2021 My mother and I spent a week at Pandazis. We had a great time around Benitses which is very well placed to travel around and calm. You can rent a car at Alpha car rental in Benitses. The studio is a 5min walk from the village  at night you'll need flashlights if you walk or you can just take the bus which stops right in front of the door as it is described. Mariana was always very friendly and gave us helpful tips. The room is small but has everything we needed and suited us perfectly. You have also a tiny beach 2min walk from there if you want a quick jump in the sea every now and then. I would recommend it to backpackers or couples.
4118512,Marine August 2021 Mariana is such a kind host. We had a very nice stay. Thé location next to the road without a sidewalk was a pitfall I think  but that’s not Mariana’s fault. Also  The bed might be lacking some comfort and the bathroom is quite small for two people. Nevertheless  we enjoyed our stay and the very beautiful view ! Thank you Mariana.
4118512,Laura August 2021 We had an amazing stay at Mariana’s place. The place was spotless clean  got even cleaned by Mariana  which was a nice surprise . In walking distance to the beach and benitses town. Mariana was always there to answer questions or to help. Just the best place to stay in Corfu!
4118512,Jana-Mareen July 2021 Best Place to stay in Korfu!! Cosy  clean and a very lovely host! We were there for 10 Days and it always felt good to come home to enjoy the beautiful view from our Room. The beach in front of the house is lovely and quite and the city Benitses is located in the middle of korfu  so its easy to explore the island. Mariana and her family were one of the greatest host we ever had! Thank you soo much for the great Time  we will come back! :)
4118512,Lisa July 2021 We had a great time at Marianas place. She is very kind and was always happy to help and answered all our questions.  The apartment itself had everything we needed. The kitchen is quite small but there was space enough for us to cook dinner there sometimes etc. The best part is the terrace with a beautiful view onto the sea. You can see the sunrise right in front of your apartment.  Benitses is a Great place to stay as well. You can easily rent a scooter and drive to beautiful beaches close by  have dinner by the sea in the small town or just drive around the island.  We really enjoyed our stay and would totally love to come back!  Thanks for everything Mariana :)
4118512,Maciej June 2021 Very welcoming little place and Mariana is a great hostess who's always happy to help
4118512,Marta June 2021 Very nice host  very smooth and helpful communication.
4118512,Natalia October 2020 I had a wonderful time at Mariana's place. This is one of the best places to stay in Benitses  as it's right at the top  so you are not overlooked and have magnificent views. I really admired the character and traditional look. Extremely helpful and responsive host. I would highly recommend this lovely place to other guests.
4118512,Carly October 2020 Mariana is so accommodating and her communication was fantastic. The studio has everything you need and the views from the balcony are grand. I hope to stay here again soon! Thank you  Mariana x
4118512,Lewis October 2020 The place is much better than we expected  especially the views! The whole family are warm and welcoming. We really recommend staying here! Hire a moped if you can  it is a drive into the centre but it will also allow you to see as much as Corfu as possible. They are really cheap.
4118512,Amaan September 2020 Had the best time here  we drove around the island and felt that Mariana's place was in our favourite part. Close to food  not super busy and nice swimming spots nearby. Airbnb was cute and worked well for our needs
4118512,Joseph September 2020 It’s perfect I want to live in this apartment. Marianna and her family are wonderful also may I add. thank you all
4118512,Hetty September 2020 A very cute cosy and clean little apartment in a lovely location
4118512,Tien August 2020 We had a great stay
4118512,Sarah August 2020 Mariana ist a very friendly person. She gave us good tips on what is worth seeing in corfu. the apartment was small but nice. everything was clean. we had a lovely stay!
4118512,Deano September 2019 Marianna is a Beautiful lady  with a beautiful family thank you for sharing your beautiful world with us.
4118512,Ahren September 2019 Mariana's place is a very cute and cozy place. For the price  it can't be beat. You get a great view of the sea and you are a 10-minute walk away from Benitses. The bed was comfortable and there is AC if it's too hot for you. The apartment has everything you need to cook. I would recommend this place to others :)
4118512,Tabea August 2019 We felt very comfortable in the cozy apartment from Mariana! She is an amazing hostess and very helpful if you have any questions. The apartment is just 5 min walk from the center of Benitses and there is a bus station in front  if you want to go somewhere else. The beach is just 100 meter and really quiet!
4118512,Matthew August 2019 Mariana is a fantastic host! Perfect directions to the location  was there to welcome us when we arrived and always available to local tips and just to say hi in the morning!
4118512,Nathan August 2019 We enjoyed our stay at Mariana's during our holidays. She was very welcoming and friendly. The house was very tidy and cozy and it also was in a good location to get around the island. We would recommend Mariana's place to any couple holiday in Corfu.
4118512,Jess July 2019 Mariana is a very kind and hospitable host and very approachable. The studio is cute  perfect for a couple with a nice view of the garden and the sea from the porch. We really enjoyed our time here! Response from Mariana August 2019 Hello dear Jessica and Philip  I am very glad that you enjoyed your holidays in Corfu! I hope to see you again! Have a nice summer  Mariana
4118512,Pippa July 2019 This was a lovely place and Mariana was a great host! The place is a little outside of Benitses which means it is a bit quieter. Very easy to find as it is just opposite the bus stop! Only downside is that the walk into Benitses isn’t very nice as it’s a busy road with no pavements. The apartment was basic but clean and had everything we needed.
4118512,Anna June 2019 We really enjoyed living there! It was very calm  comfortable  we had everything what we needed. The apartment is cute and small  had everithing inside. Mariana is a very nice host  helped in everything what we just wanted. The area is beautiful. We had all our breakfasts on our terrace watching the sea!! Beaches and restaurants are very close  but the apartment is quiet and piecefull. Thank you for hospitability!! We really do not wanted to go home. Hope we can once again!
4118512,Jéssica June 2019 I appreciated my stay at Pantazis Studios and recommend to anyone going to Corfu. The studio has an amazing view  all the amenities we needed and it’s clean. The location was great as we rented a car  only 20 minutes from the old town. Near nice beaches in the South and also about one hour drive to the top north of the island. Mariana and her family had a big smile in their face and welcomed us very well. Thank you Mariana for all!
4118512,Gradiva May 2019 Mariana's place was lovely. Very good location  with the bus stop to Corfu town and other villages along the coast just in the main entrance. Mariana and her family were always with a smile and they also gave us a family wine bottle one of the nights. She also cleaned the studio every three days. We were like home. Very recommended! 😊
4118512,Christine May 2019 Mariana was a very responsive and helpful host and her little apartment was a great place to start excursions across the island from. The bus stops right in front of the property and takes you to Korfu city within around half an hour. The apartment itself is quite basic and small (so you should like your travelling companion well ;-))  but we didn't expect it differently from the pictures  that all in all describe the place quite well. And the view from the terrace is unpayable!
4118512,Sara May 2019 Mariana was a great hostess and very helpful. She answered communications almost immediately and even loaned me her iron on the first day. The studio was as described. Basic and small but spotless and comfortable. The location was nice. A quick bus or cab ride from the village or a walk during the day. Great value stay.
4118512,Martin May 2019 Very nice place with beautiful view on the sea. Lovely garden with a lot of interesting plants and funny little cable car. Nice private room  small  but full of everything you need. Good location  very near (10 minutes walking) to village  what is full of restaurants  bars and markets. Little beaches are everywhere around.
4118512,Joanna April 2019 Marianna is a very helpful person - thank you for everything. We were very happy with our holiday. Since we don't have a driver's license  we inquired everything on foot or by bus. You can walk the Corfu Trail from Benitses (hiking trail no. 13  1 and 2)  go to the beach (100 meters from accommodation)  visit the Achilleio Castle (3 km) on foot and have a delicious meal :-) We recommend these two taverns: Paxinos and Oi Oraies Benitses. There is a direct bus connection to Corfu Town (30 min bus ride). The taxi to the airport costs 30 euros (but it is possible to go with 2 buses to the airport). One thing we had to get used to is the often missing sidewalks. But it is a problem from the island of Corfu and not from Benitses. 3/4 of the way from the accommodation to the Benitses center is possible along the beach (we preferred this way from the road). This was also fun :-)
4118512,Justyna September 2018 Mariana and her husband made our holidays easier and better as they always ware able to explain and propose a great places to visit. The house we were staying in was cosy and clean. And the view was breathtaking. We can strongly recommend Mariana’s house for people who admire privacy linked with opportunity to get some knowledge regarding culture  kitchen and best places from hosts.
4118512,Renata July 2018 The place is beautiful  has a wonderfull view  and Mariana was very atentious and kind!
4118512,Andrew June 2018 This is a fantastic place to stay in Corfu. The view from the patio of the ocean is stunning. The inside of the property is perfect for two people. Mariana was so helpful during our stay; she answered all of our questions about the buses almost immediately after we sent her a message. She even unexpectedly cleaned our room in the middle of our stay! The location is good  just a five minute walk to Benitses and literally across the street from the bus stop. 100% would stay here again  we had a great experience!
4118512,Sven April 2018 Staying at Mariana's place was amazing. Very friendly and uncomplicated communication. The apartment was very nice and we could sit outside with a great view of the sea. Bus stop was directly in front of the door  but walking to benitses just took around 5 minutes. Thanks a lot for the great time :)
4118512,Andreea September 2017 Mariana was a nice and friendly host. We find the Hause clean into a quiet place and we have enjoy our vacantion there. We had all the necesary in the Hause. We will return with pleasure on the next time 🤗😊
4118512,Cyril August 2017 We really appreciate our stay to your studio Mariana. It was perfect for us. Clean  with good equipments and good situation for going to every interesting spots of Corfu. Thank you to you and your lovely Family for all your kind attentions. We recomanded your studios (8.5/10) We wish you the best. Merci !
4118512,Cristiana June 2017 Mariana and her family were a wonderful host  welcoming  kind  available and generous. The apartment was lovely  we had our own patio overlooking the garden (full of beautiful plants in bloom) and the sea. The bus stop is right outside  and it was very easy to reach every part of the island. Benitses is also a nice little town  with nice restaurants and a few shops.
4118512,Kasia May 2017 I can highly reccomend this place. Beautiful views  very clean   cosy room  close to the beach  public transport  restaurations and very nice host.
4118512,Irene April 2017 Mariana has been very kind with us!!! The studio is nice  clean and with a wonderful sight. We suggest this location for a private relaxing stay in Corfu'!
4118512,Edith October 2016 Everything was perfect! Mariana and her Family was so friendly and we appreciated the dad concert of local music !!! We hope so the new baby are born Now !
4118512,Anne -Kathrin August 2016 My friend and me had a wonderful week. The appartment was just big enough for two. The sea view from the terrasse was beautiful. We had a little bathroom which was in need of getting used to. T he street just in front of the appartment is trafficked so that you have to be careful walkingthe way to the beach. We really enjoied this place. Mariana and her family were very friendly and kind. Thank you for everything.
4118512,Jane July 2016 My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Pantazis Studios. The studio was spotless and perfectly big enough and Mariana was a great host. The view from the terrace is gorgeous and the studio is surrounded by lovely gardens. We found the walk into Benitses fine in the daytime as long as you watch out for cars and walk single file... Not so easy to do when it's dark but a taxi is only about 5 euros. Benitses has plenty of places to eat and drink and is a great place to stay as attractions in Corfu are easily accessible from the village. Overall we had a brilliant holiday and would highly recommend Pantazis Studios.
4118512,Thomas June 2016 Mariana was a lovely host and made us feel incredibly welcome! We had a lovely stay at Pantazis studios and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking to visit Corfu.
4118512,Anvarzhon October 2015 Mariana and her husband made us feel very welcome. It started with our late check-in - Mariana allowed us to become after midnight and was very friendly even after our flight was delayed. They provided us welcoming drinks  fresh towels during our stay and plenty of good advice. The apartment looked as advertised - even though the sanitary unit felt super-small and it's not very clear from AirBnB pictures. Killer view from the terrace compensates it  but by the end of the week you start dreaming about more space in the shower and WC. The neighbourhood is quiet - it is a bit aside from the main street of Benitses village. We personally liked it  but you would need to walk ca 10 minutes if you want to have a dinner in one of many taverns in the village. Walking on Corfu roads is not safe  though. Fortunately  bus stop is literally downstairs from Mariana's apartments  and there were no problems to park.
4118512,Suzanne August 2015 Mariana made us feel welkome and was cooperative in helping us plan our days in benitses. her little studio was neat and clean. IT had a terrace that overlooked the sea and we could enjoy the morning sun there while planning our day. The studio's are easy to be found at the Side of the Road  there are parking spaces opposite or a bus stop in front. We made a trip to the island of paxi and antipaxi from benitses  the boat leaves from the benitses harbour  only a few minuten drive from the studio's.
4118512,Linda October 2022 The apartment has a great location for exploring the island from there. The contact was also easy and always very timely. Since the bathroom is very small and without ventilation  we unfortunately always had a light humidity in the complete accommodation. The plus point is definitely the terrace in front of the cabin with the beautiful sunrise! Translated from German  Show original
4118512,Janne September 2022 Mariana is a super warm host and always helped us quickly and responded! The location of the accommodation is great  especially if you want to vacation without a car - only 5 minutes walk to a beautiful beach  which you often have almost to yourself! It takes 10 minutes to get to the nearest small village  where small supermarkets (large supermarkets in Corfu town are much cheaper) and many nice restaurants invite you to linger! Due to the fact that there is a bus stop right outside the door  you are also well offered to Corfu Town and the airport! With all the advantages  however  you have to bear with the fact that you can already hear the traffic! The property is as described and the value for money is definitely right! The terrace and the view you have from this one is an absolute highlight! The only negative was the recurring unpleasant smell of sewage or the like  but of course this can only have been an inappropriate time for us  which otherwise does not occur! I would recommend Mariana's place! Translated from German  Show original
4118512,Theresa September 2022 Our vacation in Corfu was very nice. :) Great communication with Mariana  always helpful and likeable. The beach is just a few meters away and we were often the only ones there. A bus stop is right across the street. 👍🏼 From the terrace you have a beautiful view of the sea. Everything was clean  so value for money was great. :) The equipment in the kitchen would still be a bit of a workaround. We enjoyed our stay😊 Translated from German  Show original
4118512,Orianne July 2022 Great stay! Beautiful view from the terrace! Highly recommended! Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Sumi July 2022 We had a lovely time  you have a very nice view and the hostess is super sweet! :) Translated from German  Show original
4118512,Fabrizio June 2022 Great location Perfect host and great communication Beautiful view. Small and uncomfortable bathroom but everything else was perfect. We had a good time Translated from Italian  Show original
4118512,Anna October 2021 A small cottage with its own terrace next to the main house and a beautiful view of the sea and mainland - everything was great  only the bathroom was a bit tight. But the value for money is more than fair. In addition  communication with Mariana is very straightforward and she responds quickly & helpful! Translated from German  Show original
4118512,Diane September 2021 Quiet and well-located place to discover Corfu Cleanliness of the place Warm welcome Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Salomé August 2021 Great Airbnb! Ideal location on the island  20 minutes by scooter from the city of Corfu  with incredible sea views! Benitses is a very nice village  you can find plenty of good cheap restaurants including the Zorbas Tavern a 5-min walk from the Airbnb  which we recommend 200% !!! The kindness of our host made our stay very pleasant! Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Maureen June 2021 We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb ! The sea view is amazing and the village very charming. I would recommend this property. Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Enora May 2021 We were warmly welcomed by Mariana and her mom. The accommodation is ideal for two people  great location away from the city. Car is  in my opinion  essential. The view from the terrace is beautiful. The town is lovely  by the sea lots of restaurants but if you take the time to return to the old town you will discover a charming colorful village. I highly recommend this accommodation and its hosts  very friendly and friendly. Translated from French  Show original
4118512,Sophie October 2019 Excellent ten day stay at Mariana's studio. Located a five-minute walk from the village of Benitses  the location is ideal for those who want to be in peace and enjoy the beaches and a great sea view. The blue line bus stop and greenbus stop at the foot of the house which allows you to visit the island of Corfu even without a car. The accommodation  meanwhile  is very quiet and perfectly clean. It has a terrace and functional amenities  it is ideal for a single person or a couple. We enjoyed the tranquility and the location outside the touristy spots. We were very well hosted by our host (and his lovely family) who was patient  available and attentive to advise us as best we could during our stay (including the Zorbas de Benistses Tavernne in which we enjoyed ourselves.) I recommend this place for its unique hospitality! Translated from French  Show original

2610817,Stuart October 2022 Lovely house in a beautiful and peaceful location
2610817,Lydia October 2022 What a nice few days. The welcome by Viktoria was excellent  she made us feel very welcome. The outside space and pool was just the best. Would love to be able to return at some point in the future. Thank you 😊 Response from Vasiliki October 2022 It waa pleasure also for me to accommodate you to villa Arias!Hore to see you again!
2610817,"Eleanor September 2022 Villa Agrias is a fab  get-away-from-it-all hideaway in the middle of olive groves and grapevines. If you are looking for utter peace and quiet  with nobody around to spoil your enjoyment  this is the place to go!  Viktoria  our host  was absolutely lovely - lots of great communication before and during our stay. She gave us loads of tips about where to shop  eat out  excursions etc and her English is excellent. The owner also left us a bottle of wine from the vineyard just up the road (very drinkable!) and a 6 pack of large bottles of water  which was very welcome!  Just 15 mins walk from the villa to a vast  west-facing  2km long  sandy beach backed by dunes. There's just enough waves to make swimming interesting  but shallow enough for kids to paddle about. Oh and a fab Tayo beach bar halfway along it  where you can rent sunbeds and umbrellas cheaper than anywhere else on Corfu  or just visit  as we did  at sunset and watch the sun sink under the sea with a nice cocktail in your hand. Look for flamingos and herons on the lagoon when you walk back. There's plenty of free parking all along the lagoon if you prefer to drive to the beach.  Most afternoons we headed back to hang out at the pool as the sun shines on it until about 6/7pm. The garden is full of shady citrus trees  olive trees and lovely flowers  with a hammock and swing too  so very relaxing. The villa was spacious and the kitchen was great - very well stocked with four electric rings  oven  microwave  toasty maker  juicer and a good range of tools and gadgets  pans & dishes. There's also a welcome selection of herbs and spices  salt  pepper  olive oil  tin foil etc plus everything you need for washing up & cleaning  including dishwasher tablets and laundry liquid! But the best place to cook is the covered  outdoor kitchen with it's huge  brick-built BBQ. There's plenty of space to have three griddles going at once  so you can do meat  fish & veggies all at the same time. The villa interior is not quite as ""luxury"" as the photos show  it's getting a little tired and was a bit more ""shabby chic"" than anything  but that didn't bother us one little jot. We enjoyed it just the same. Bath and pool towels are provided  but they ask you to bring your own beach towels. There's also a dishwasher and washing machine  which wer very convenient. Shopping - there are 2 small supermarkets in the local village (5kms/10 mins) which have everything you could need. We used the one nearest the villa as it has a car park opposite. But  don't buy meat from them  go to the butcher a few doors down. Absolutely lovely people who will cut up a lamb or a cow into virtually any cut you want on their huge  ancient  olive tree trunk butcher's block. Their spicy sausages are amazing too. Even when we just saw the husband or wife in the street they would wave to us! There are also 2 bakeries which have amazing  freshly baked bread every day. If you want fresh fish you need to go on a trip to Petriti harbour (15kms/30 mins) as that's where the fishing boats come in. Or buy some from the many fishmongers in Corfu town when you visit. Eating out - we went to three of the five local tavernas while we were there. All were max 5 mins in the car  most are walkable  but given the lack of street lighting only really doable in daylight! Alonaki Bay - huge menu  lots of local and traditional dishes  lovely service and a view that can't be beaten! Restaurant is high up on a cliff  with tables dotted around under beautiful trees in their garden. Go early/book ahead to get a balcony table overlooking the sea and watch the sun go down as you dine. The Farm - small menu but for a reason - they specialise in traditional  clay-oven cooked ""pulled"" pork  lamb and beef. Absolutely divine. And you must try their oven-baked  melted feta and peppers dish to start. Seating under under giant olive trees in their pretty garden. Open in the evenings only while we were there in September. Taverna Spiros - super-friendly  family run place where the son goes out spear fishing for the ""catch of the day"" (sea bream on the evening we went there). He's very proud of his endeavours and photos of him fishing are all over the restaurant! Mum cooks  he waits the tables and dad  well Spiros is retired and sits around with his buddies drinking coffee and grappa! We bumped into Spiros while walking down to the beach one day as he has a plot of land at the bottom of the olive groves  near the beach. We had very funny conversation with him about his many chickens and ducks in his broken  but understandable English! He also grows all the veg for the restaurant there too. Great holiday  great villa  great host - we hope to go back! Show more Response from Vasiliki October 2022 thank you so much for your schools!I hope to meet you next time! Translated  Show original"
2610817,Margareta September 2022 Lovely property. Had a great stay.
2610817,Ingrid September 2022 Totally loved our stay . We were welcomed by Victoria who made sure everything we needed was provided . An in between clean was done . We also met the friendly owner who gave us some fish . The villa is isolated with a pool area to have great family time . Theres an amazing beach bar Tayo 5 minutes car drive away and several authentic greek restaurants nearby . Thank you Vasiliki for your hospitality!
2610817,Dorel September 2022 We enjoyed our stay in quiet and secluded villa. The pool is really nice and big. The house is a bit far away but that didn’t bother us. It was a bit difficult to find the right road on the first night because it was dark and maps directs to wrong place  but afterwards it was ok. To sum up we really liked the house.
2610817,Lecca August 2022 The villa was very private and the pool was beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay- Victoria was very welcoming and helpful.
2610817,Alice July 2022 This villa is a little slice of heaven! We absolutely loved staying here. The beach at Halikounas is so lovely and the restaurants were great. I’d particularly recommend the Alonaki Taverna for dinner at sunset. The track to the villa is very rough but once we got the hang of it it was fine and the gate was a challenge for us when we arrived at midnight. Vicky is really friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this stay.
2610817,Andre July 2022 The property is rustic  not near to amenities and a car is essential. It is good value for money with a welcoming garden and pool area. The internet connection is not reliable and the access road needs attention. Victoria (the caretaker) is an absolute star and always willing and available to assist!
2610817,Alexander June 2022 Villa Argias is such an amazing and tranquil place! The property is well maintained and everything was just as it is in the photos. Vasiliki was very flexible with check in and check out (as we arrived very late and left very early). My family had a wonderful holiday at this beautiful property near Chalikounas Beach; I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone traveling to Corfu! Response from Vasiliki June 2022 Thank you Alexander!See you again!
2610817,Abi June 2022 We had an amazing stay  the pictures do not do the house justice! Everything was very clean and we had everything we needed. Communication was great and we were made to feel very welcome and looked after. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone planning a visit to Corfu! Response from Vasiliki July 2022 Thank you Abi for your kind words and comments!Has been a pleasure hosting you and i would be at your disposal next time you will revisit Corfu!
2610817,Hattie June 2022 An amazing place to stay and relax for a week in the sun. You’ll definitely need a car as it’s quite remote. Beautiful pool and garden area. Very well stocked with everything you need. Highly recommend! Response from Vasiliki June 2022 Thank you Hattie!I will be glad to host you again!
2610817,Rani June 2022 We enjoyed our stay and had a very nice vacation. We would like to thanks Victoria. She was very sweet and the communication with her was very good. Also thanks for the nice welcome gifts. A big plus were the trees with the fresh fruit. You definitely need a car because nothing is close by. Response from Vasiliki June 2022 thank you! hore to see you again!
2610817,Marthe April 2022 We had a pleasant time in Corfu. The location is a bit secluded but it is a very quiet and lovely place. Be prepared that you definitely need a car. The garden and the pool are great and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. We didn't have wifi unfortunately  but that only slightly bothered us.
2610817,Karolis October 2021 Very nice house with a pool  totally private location. Perfect for a family vacation!
2610817,Inka September 2021 Very quite end lovely place. Thank you very much. A fresh lemon water every morning from the trees in the Garden and in the evening some flower smell soo beautiful 🥰
2610817,Lucy September 2021 We had a lovely stay at the property and (with a car) it's within easy reach of good tavernas and kitesurfing. We'd reccomend Spiros and Alonaki Bay. The only frustration we really had was that the wifi didn't work at all well.
2610817,Richard September 2021 We had a great holiday at the villa.. it is peaceful and well equipped and had everything we needed. A car is a necessity but there is a beach within easy reach and local shops a 10 minute drive away..I’d highly recommend a stay here! Response from Vasiliki September 2021 Thank you Richard!Hore to see you again!
2610817,Ella August 2021 This is a stunning villa and the pictures don’t do it justice! It is completely private and secluded with no other villas nearby  which is lovely. But be prepared that you will definitely need a car and to drive down a dirt track to reach the villa! Brilliant added touches such as a bottle of wine and fruit on arrival - such a lovely treat! The host is also really lovely  friendly and willing to help with anything you need. Nearby recommendations: Taverna Alonaki Bay - walking distance  beautiful setting  lovely staff and good food. Also Taverna Avra Ocean in Prassudi - the most amazing salad and great veggie options on the menu! A perfect villa for a group holiday!
2610817,Rifat July 2021 Great place for honeymooners Response from Vasiliki July 2021 Thank you too Rifat!Hore to see you again!
2610817,Stéphanie July 2021 We enjoyed our stay in this villa. It was well located in a quiet and authentic place (not too many tourists). The house was clean  charming and welcoming. The garden was very flowered and fruity so that we could have a fresh orange and lemon juice every day... Victoria was very helpful and reactive. We would recommend this villa without any hesitation...
2610817,Dana July 2021 Very private! We enjoyed being able to play music at the pool while we swam without disturbing any neighbors. The pool it lovely! We loved making fresh orange juice every morning from oranges from the trees in the garden. Highly recommend! Response from Vasiliki July 2021 Thank you Dana!
2610817,Jasmijn July 2021 My friends and I have really enjoyed our stay at this house. Upon arrival  we were surprised by some delicious treats (amongst others homemade tzatziki) that were left at the house for us. There are citrus trees in the garden  from which you may take some oranges or lemons when and if you like. The pool is refreshing and cleaned a few times per week. You do really have to get used to the many many insects that live around the house: big ants  bees and wasps  grasshoppers  some (quite big) spiders and a lot of noise from crickets. Fortunately  there are insect screens in a lot of windows - thanks to those and keeping the other windows closed  we didn’t really have many insects inside the house itself. There is a good working airconditiong in the living room and in the two bedrooms. Our contact person was really friendly  showed us some nice places on a map and delivered us some extra towels when we requested them. A rental car is a must in this area - it’s indeed a very secluded house. You can walk to some restaurants in the area  but at night it’s really dark and there is no single street lantern in this area. We tried walking home from a restaurant once  and decided we were not doing this again. A drive to Corfu town is about 45 mins.  Overall: the service was great and the house was exactly as can be seen on the pictures with many “nice spots” outside.

2610817,Donna October 2020 Lovely secluded property  very well equipped. Stayed with two young children who loved the pool and exploring the garden. A few nice sandy beaches nearby but you will need a car as the property is remote. Perfect place for peace and quiet and to unwind for a few days. Thank you Vasiliki!
2610817,Bethan September 2020 We enjoyed an amazing few days at the villa. Having the pool was a great extra and the whole space was really enjoyable. I would recommend and wouldn’t hesitate to book again.
2610817,Dörte August 2020 We had a super pleasant time
2610817,Florent June 2019 Great place with a great host. The house is ideally “isolated” which provides privacy yet close to the nearest villages and beaches for every day shopping and discovering the area. The pool was the highlight of our stay for the kids. Response from Vasiliki June 2019 I m waiting for you  you will have one week free to the villa us i told you!
2610817,Nick June 2019 The villa was lovely! 4 of us (2 couples) stayed early june and had a great time. Very local feel to the area  definitely get Vasiliki & Anna to recommend you a few local tavernas or hunt your own down. I recommend hiring a car  fairly essential for this area as while the beach & 2 taverans are in walking distance  you'll want to go further afield.  The pool was cleaned and refreshing  we had a lovely little BBQ in the pit provided and many sweet touches. Beach towels provided  and Anna delivered us a delicious brioche halfway through and responded to all our queries very quickly. All the pictures and description are perfectly accurate  so have no fear on that count.  Thanks Anna & Vasiliki!
2610817,Laura June 2019 We had a really nice time at the villa. It‘s a very quiet location to relax and have fun in the pool. It was very clean and Vicky and Anna gave us really good recommendations for restaurants in the area. Thanks again! Response from Vasiliki June 2019 Thank you too Laura!I hope to see you again!
2610817,Maija May 2019 I recommend to everyone who loves idyllic and quiet recreation in a house surround by olive trees. Vasiliki had a pleasant communication  all the issues were solved fast. The house is regulalry cleaned  towels are changed  wich was a pleasant bonus.
2610817,Oana May 2019 Viki’s place is amazing anf extremely cozy. We loved our stay there. It truly was a charming experience. Also  she is a great person  super hospitable and nice.
2610817,Jennifer April 2019 Visiliki's villa is lovely  and she is a very welcoming host. She was easy to communicate with and even came round with food for us. The villa looks just as it does it the photos. The pool and garden are really nice. Response from Vasiliki April 2019 as the villa is in a protective area is not easy to be sealed !!I always try to fix it!I always do my best!
2610817,Anna April 2019 Vasiliki’s villa is lovely  especially in the sun! Vasiliki herself is also very lovely  ensuring that our stay was the best it could be at all times. Would very much recommend this place but ensure you hire a car!
2610817,Freddy October 2017 The host canceled this reservation 260 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2610817,Elena September 2017 House and surrounding was much better than the photos show. Nice and clean swimming pool. A lot of outside space where you can always find a sun on the terrace or shadow under the beautiful tree. Vasiliki is a great host  she is a very helpful and kind person  always in touch wherever you need! Thank you Vasiliki!
2610817,Mark August 2017 Great spot  beautiful property in lovely secluded spot. Clean and well equipped  nice pool and very helpful host. Thank you Vasilliki ! Would recommend 😎
2610817,Jeannine July 2017 This charming house is set in a very peaceful location amongst the olive groves. It Is possible to walk down to the beach  and a local taverna. The house is well appointed  tastefully decorated and comfortably furnished. The owner is establishing a garden and as it matures the house will become even more attractive. There is a BBQ area and plenty of outdoor seating. The owner very generously gave us organic vegetables from her Mother's garden and there are orange and lemon trees at the villa. This is a great place to relax and chill out! Response from Vasiliki July 2017 Jeannine thank you for the details that you write me because with your review we will become better!I hope to see you again and to care of you and of your friends!Thanks a lot!!
2610817,Nadezhda August 2016 We spent in a house one week in August 2016 and really enjoyed the stay.  The house is very nice and comfortable. The house matches the description and in reality we found it better than we expected. All equipment was in working order. Kitchen is fully equipped and contains enough dishes and other equipment for cooking (but no microwave oven).  The house is hidden in olive gardens far from resorts and touristic routes. It provides full privacy and suitable for those who don’t want to have neighbors. There are no other houses in the near. It is easy to come to the beach  shop or tavern by car. The car is necessary to stay there.  Swimming pool is simple but nice and clean. We got a lot of pleasure bathing there. During our stay swimming pool was regularly cleaned. Swimming pool has no evening lighting inside but there are lights around the swimming pool.  Wi-fi is working but connection speed is very slow. It is enough speed for mail and messengers  but surfing takes a long time. This is because wi-fi is provided through satellites.  Vasiliki and her husband are very hospitable and communicative owners who helped us to organize perfect holiday keeping our privacy.  We thank Vasiliki for our holiday and recommend this house for those who are looking for secluded place.

2610817,Sasha September 2015 We got exactly what we were hoping for when we arrived at Vassiliki's home in a quiet part of the south west of Corfu. It is well off the beaten track and perfect if you are seeking some solitude - whilst being only a few moments' drive from one of the best beaches on the island.  We wanted to feel like we were in the middle of nowhere and not too close to the more built up  touristy parts of the island. Halikounas beach is long  sandy and served by a handy bar on each end. Our stay was towards the end of the holiday season (mid-Sept) and by this point  the beaches were nice and quiet. End to end  the beach is a forty minute walk and it was easy to either find some room completely to yourself or pitch up at one of the bars.  The house itself is lovely and spacious. Our instant thoughts were that the photos didn't really do place justice. The kitchen is well equipped and both bedrooms air conditioned and comfortable. We paid the extra for the swimming pool and enjoyed the space around it. Of an evening  the balcony area is a good  sheltered spot. One evening  we sat with glasses of wine whilst a storm hit the island much further north. Dramatic lightening flashed across the sky and it felt very romantic.  We got lost on the late drive down to Halikounas but Vassiliki and her partner never lost their patience and helped us find our way  welcoming us with two souvlakis. They were delicious!  It is worth noting that a car is an absolute must for this property. It is a good 15 mins drive to the closest town and even the closest tavernas are best driven to. A walk back along the rural and pitch black roads and dirt tracks after an evening of drinking is probably not a good idea!  Whenever we return to Corfu  this is definitely where we will want to stay again. Show more
2610817,"Francesca August 2015 Rats under the roof  electric shocks and false promises!  The house is potentially beautiful  nestled in the country  but looks wrecked  with dirty unmanned garden. Also the ""new swimming pool"" is almost abandoned  unfinished  with rust all over the stairs. In two weeks’ time  we saw more technicians and contractors than beaches. We had to cut our holiday short. Upon our arrival  despite we had been previously expressively assured that the internet was accessible  we’ve been informed that it was in fact not available. Actually  we discovered that then the connection had never been installed at all. Then we had to deal with the washing machine  which was out of order (broken by ""other guests..some time before” - ! ). This was a major setback  considering also our family needs  with two kids under the age of 4. Then there was the failure of the water system in the bathroom and the kitchen.. During the day and the night  with disappointment  we heard mice/rats running up and down over our heads under the roof. The property owner did simply nothing about this (quite sadly  also due to the dangerous diseases that these animals may carry along..). Lastly  using the shower  we received few electrical shocks! When we complained  we have been told that they were responsibility of the electric company and that previous tenants mentioned the problem as well (!!!). According to the property manager/owner there was nothing to fear anyway because these were only minor discharges. We’ve then resolved to leave for good. We are not spoiled clients and lead a simple life. We were just looking for a nice place  family time and peace of mind after a year of hard work. We can definitely understand - and were ready to endure - ordinary house management troubles  but it became evident that we could not stay. The place  which was not free of course  was not as presented nor suitable for a vacation. Hygiene and safety are not a joke. Show more Response from Vasiliki August 2015 It would be better for you not to talk about hygiene because it was the first time that i saw my house in such dirty condition with all the towels so dirty because you used them to the beach as a beach towel or a rug!And it s sure that all these are lies because i didn t give you back money when you decide to live the house for your problems!!From the beghining you created only problems!you arrived to corfu with your suitcases full of dirty clothes from the camping that you where before and consequently it s natural that you couldnt wait for a single day for the spare part of the laundry to arrive !And about the noices on roof are expected as the house is surrunded with olive trees .Sorry i couldnt murder all the animals cats and eventually rats which dared to clibe the roof!!Next time try to find a cottage downtown!!Good luck!!

2610817,Nele September 2020 We had a great stay at Vasiliki's place. The surroundings are super nice  quiet and secluded. The house is very nicely decorated  the pool and garden are ideal for relaxing. We even spontaneously booked one more night. Due to the location  cell phone reception is little available  unfortunately the WiFi was not possible with us either. But we didn't think it was that bad  as we could enjoy the house and the surroundings very well. Vasiliki was still easy to reach for us and took care of everything. Thanks to Vasiliki!

2610817,"Cora September 2020 the house and the property are completely neglected: on our arrival we first found a huge horned nest directly above the entrance door  so entering the property was really dangerous. Later  Vasiliki said that the nest was new and must have been created recently. That was excluded  though  because it was huge  not just a few days away. The pool is lined with a tarp inside that's totally softened because it's very old and the ""pool boy"" also tends in the chemicals. That's why the pool smells so bad. The whole property is unkempt  there is something everywhere  whether trash or broken items. We didn't use the grill and outdoor dining area because everything was so dirty and gross. You can't use the gas stove outside because there is no gas bottle. Outside cabinets are broken and are inhabited by mice. The beautiful large outdoor table in the photos  crumbs when touching. The hammocks are all broken. In the house we found all the dishes dirty. We had to rinse everything off first. An air conditioner did not work (in this bedroom it was about 40 degrees)  the mosquito net in the same room was not lockable and the fridge incl. Freezer did not work. Vasiliki was not available and only communicated by text. After many hours  she was ready to come and take a look. She brought a technician who fixed the air conditioning in need  but at night she ran out of a gallon of water  so one of us had to sleep on the floor in the kitchen (the 5th bed  the ""sleeping couch"" is about 1.50 m long and 60 cm wide  is in the kitchen-living room without blackout possibility - so not to be used). In addition  the ""repaired"" air conditioning was now as noisy as a jet plane. The next day  an acquaintance of her brought a very small replacement refrigerator  also completely stained. In the whole kitchen there were only two huge pots in which you could cook for an Army but not for 4 people. Overall  the kitchen was very poorly equipped  especially with old and cluttered stuff. The dishwasher was completely calcified and barely cleaned. Some interior parts  such as the strainer  were missing. She was also just disgusting. The shower in the bathroom is totally calcified and stained. The massage jets are disgusting  so dirty. The Siphon is open  all black  and full of hair. If you have older children and value Wi-Fi  be warned. The Wi-Fi is almost impossible and you usually don't have a mobile network. She said everything was fine recently. To sum up  there is an estimated €50 000 in a huge renovation backlog. As the condition is now  50€/night in the high season are ok. But not 210€  as we have paid. Even if everything is renovated  I don't think it's more than €120 to charge. Vasiliki just doesn't take care of the house and the property. She would have to change her setting radically and not just be on the fast track. Show more Translated from German  Show original Response from Vasiliki September 2020 Dear Guests  I apologise for the bad experience that you had at the villa. According to your comments  Of course a nest with bees  a dirty pool and smelly pool  garbage all over the yard   broken particles  a dirty grill a not operational stove   broken closets with rats  dirty dishes .a not operational air condition as well and a broken fridge  the dirty bathroom with a discusting sifon a wifi that does not work  the collapsing outdoor table and the very dirty and unorganized kitchen are not part of a villa but rather of a hennery.

2610817,Tim September 2019 It's a super nice house. There were five of us. 4 beds and the sofa could be used. The garden and pool are great. Without a car  the house is virtually impossible to reach. It takes about 20 minutes by car to get to the nearest smaller supermarket. However  due to the seclusion  you are alone and rarely hear more than a dog barking or a rooster Translated from German  Show original Response from Vasiliki September 2019 it was a wonderful experience to host Tim and his friends!too clean and in order !Ihope to see you again!
2610817,Sebastian August 2019 Wonderful property:) Translated from German  Show original
2610817,Stephan August 2019 Beautiful accommodation in a very quiet location in the middle of olive trees. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. The property  pool and garden are very well maintained. For vacationers who want to relax  this is the place to be. We want to come back. Translated from German  Show original
2610817,Frits April 2019 Top accommodation  very enjoyed! We'd love to come back! Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Vasiliki May 2019 I m so happy that you have had a nice time!I will wait for you to host you again!
2610817,Federica September 2015 We spent 16 days in this beautiful home. First of all  Vasiliki  the host  is a special person: always attentive and available to give his guests a wonderful vacation; I have never found such hospitality anywhereelse! The house is surrounded by olive trees  very close (800 m) to the beautiful and unspoiled Halicunas beach  ideal for those who want to spend a quiet vacation. There's even a dishwasher in the house  and the pool is very nice and clean. Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Vasiliki September 2015 Thank you Federica!I'm very happy to have met you!!Hugs! Translated  Show original
2610817,Sandra July 2015 Quality house with swimming pool  clean and relatively well appointed. It is secluded  lost amid olive trees in a totally quiet location. The beach is a 5-minute drive. However  you have to get organized because the water is not potable and the shops are not nearby. ( 10 minutes by car ...) Vasiliki is a lovely host  available both before our arrival and during our stay;she gave us a very good welcome and did everything to make our stay go smoothly... (typical cuisine  good tavernas addresses  places not to be missed...) Translated from French  Show original
32326675,Angela October 2022 A beautiful  well designed villa with gorgeous views and in a perfect location. Eleana was very kind; everything went very smoothly. One of the best stays we have ever had.
32326675,Nils October 2022 Perfect villa with stunning terrace  garden & view. Light and nice interior as well - all perfect!
32326675,Matthew September 2022 The villa was everything we’d hoped for - huge open spaces on the balcony  large pool with a garden for the children to play and sea views which were just amazing to wake up to every morning.  The villa was very clean and tidy with great facilities like the coffee machine and huge outdoor bbq/cooking space.  Air conditioned rooms and the cots supplied really helped our young children settle in and sleep comfortably. Our flight was delayed and our host kindly did a small shop to get us through the morning. This was extremely helpful.  Overall  the villa is spacious  clean  airy and professionally run.
32326675,Tereza September 2022 We had a great time in the Panorama villa. Upon our arrival we were greeted by our host  Eleana  who was very kind and helpfull and gave us many tips on where to eat  go for a short trip etc. She was also always ready to help and answer our questions during our whole stay. The villa itself was clean with everything we could possibly need including such datails as beach towels and parasols. But the best part was the pool and garden with a beautiful olive tree and magnificent view. A very calm and nice part of the Arillas beach was just a 10 minute walk away just like some small shops and tavernas. Overall we couldn't be more satisfied and would come back anytime.
32326675,Emma July 2022 Fantastic villa. Beautiful pool  garden and terrace with wonderful views. The location is perfect  on the edge of the village  so very peaceful but an easy walk to a gorgeous beach and restaurants. Very comfortable and spacious living areas  comfortable beds (choice of ceiling fan or AC)  big  functional kitchen and BBQ area. Very helpful host too. Would definitely return!
32326675,Janet July 2022 I cannot fault this villa in any way - perfect location  stunning views and the best pool we have ever seen at a villa! The villa was clean and well equipped and we were fine without a car (6 adults) - we walked everywhere then got a taxi one evening to a restaurant further away. George the host was absolutely amazing and very kind - nothing was too much trouble and he really went out of his way to help us. Lots of personal recommendations for restaurants and activities which were all brilliant. Thank you so much George and we will be back to visit Corfu again as soon as we can!
32326675,Silvie June 2022 Great house with lovely clean pool. Beautiful lacation with a view of the sea. Comunication was nice. It was the best holiday!
32326675,Denise May 2022 We had a really great week at the villa. The pool was really lovely and the location was perfect. The sunsets were beautiful  the beach pristine and the people so friendly and welcoming to us. The villa is supported by a great host and is spacious and ideally situated for a great experience.
32326675,Eva October 2021 A very nice place to stay  very neatly. Great service and a great host. Very nice view. Perfect holiday!!!
32326675,Thibault September 2021 The Villa was great for one week family holiday. The inside furniture and decoration is a bit dated to our taste but beds were very comfortable and the apartment is altogether very functional (dishwasher  washing machine)  The outdoor space including the huge terrace  pool  garden and Barbecue is where we spent most time and we really enjoyed it.  The pool is suitable for small kids as there are a few steps on which they can bath (there are also spare toys for babies). It’s also very secure as there’s a wooden fence on the terrace preventing kids to go down to the swimming pool on their own.  The house is located 10 minutes by foot to the beach front where you will find ample number of shops and restaurants It’s a good base if you want to explore the northwest of the Island (Palaiokastritsa is 45 minutes away  Sidari where you find bigger supermarkets is 20 minutes away). Driving to Corfu town or to the northeast beautiful villages (Kassiopi  Agios Stefanos) will require one hour.  One of the best thing about this house is the host  George. He is very nice  accommodating  available to help resolve problems or share tips. He went out of his way to find a road bike rental for me. The experience would not be the same without him.

32326675,Meghan July 2021 The house is as perfect as on the pictures  it has all amenities you can imagine to make your stay perfect. The cherry ont he cake is the host George  who answers all your questions day and nights  and has all the good local tips to make your stay perfect! This place is highly recommended to any group of friends who'd like to spend a week or more enjoying all that Corfu Island has to offer.
32326675,Kai June 2021 the villa was phantastic  perfectly located and george and his staff were super helpful and extremly nice. we enjoyed every second there. thx george!!
32326675,Katie November 2020 The villa was nice and clean and had everything you could need.
32326675,David September 2020 Lovely property  well maintained and clean. There is a walk to the beach up/down a small hill.
32326675,Jennifer September 2019 We had a fantastic stay at Panorama Villa. The villa is in a great location - walkable to Ariilas for the beach or dinner  but also felt incredibly secluded and private whilst we were there - the views are stunning.  The layout is great especially the outdoor space of dining area and lounge area outside and that the pool was below and slightly separate made it fell safer for children as they couldn't run out to it from bedroom. The pool was great - the steps made for a nice paddling area for the 4yr old in our party and it was warm enough to use straight in the morning. We ate outside for every meal we had at the villa - we were bothered a little by wasps but citronella candles and insect repellent incense burners helped and from speaking to friends on a different part of Corfu this is common.  The kitchen was well equipped for all our cooking needs including a dishwasher and we really appreciated the thoughtful touches of wine  bread and nibbles as a welcome gift.  Right from the start George sent us lots of information ahead of us arriving so we knew the transport options and how to get there. George also sent us some great reccomendations for the local area for places to eat and visit which is used and might not have seen otherwise. He was incredibly friendly and helpful during our stay.  Lastly Arillas is a great spot especially for families. The beach is very shallow so you can wander out for a while without it getting to deep which felt very safe. There are lots of lovely cafes and restaurants that are open from breakfast through to late night.  Would highly recommend staying here ! Thank you for a lovely relaxing stay. Show more
32326675,Rimantas July 2019 Very nice and helpful host. Great communication  met us after trip on late evening with some meal and drinks. We had all what we needed in villa  super clean around  amazing views. We had wonderful time there and wanna come back.
32326675,Josh May 2019 Stunning villa. Beautiful village. Great host. Can I really say more!? Fantastic place. The pool and BBQ make the stay very enjoyable and there are great amenities in the villa and within the village. Try the local fish and local wine - stunning!
32326675,Kirsten October 2022 Very nice house in a fantastic location overlooking the sea. Just outside  but still central. It is about a 10-minute walk to the stall and there you will also find shopping opportunities. The house is equipped with everything and for a week stay there is even an intermediate cleaning. The terrace and outdoor area is very large  very well maintained and offers plenty of space. You will find plenty of opportunities to chill in the sun or in the shade. The next visit is prepped! Translated from German  Show original
32326675,Anna September 2022 We enjoyed our stay. The two bathrooms were very practical for us with six adults and two young children. Also  that was cleaned once during our stay was great. The provision of two extra beds and high chairs was easily possible. The pool was always clean  is a great size and depth and we liked to use the outdoor shower. It was also practical that the terrace can be closed with a gate and small children cannot access the pool on their own. Overall  we also liked the place  the selection of shops and restaurants and that you could reach two beaches in a short time on foot. Communication with Hostlab was great and very friendly. We can 100% recommend the villa. Translated from German  Show original
32326675,Olivia May 2022 We had a great time in this house. The big plus about this house is its terrace and garden. The views are stunning. The equipment is very complete. The communication was very good with Eleana  she is very responsive. Thank you again for this stay! Translated from French  Show original
32326675,Laurent Et Sylvie April 2022 The house is beautiful  well furnished and very well located! The huge terrace facing the sea is really a plus! We very much enjoyed the location of the house in a small village on the sea close to many sites to visit and the tranquility of the place. Translated from French  Show original
32326675,Olaf September 2021 Very nice  spacious house with sea view to the sunset side  beautiful very clean pool surrounded by large well-kept garden. Car is recommended as restaurants  supermarket or beach are otherwise a bit difficult to reach. George is a very nice host  easy communication (English)  very good tips  we had a good time in Arillas... Translated from German  Show original

49580547,Timon September 2021 Very pleasant stay
49580547,Miroslav September 2021 Perfect location right at the beach  with 3 nice beach bars very close  where you can grab some drinks or meal (Bodega Beach Bar was definitely the best of them). The best part of the whole apartment is the spacious terrace with the stunning sea view.
49580547,Olga September 2021 A house on a wonderful sand beach with a great sea view!!! Statis is a very kind host  helped us with the transport from and to the airport. We visited early Sep  2021. The place is about 13km from Kerkyra town. If you do not have a car/scooter  be prepared to walk 35-40 minutes (depending on your fitness) up a steep road to get to the bus that can take you to the town. Going down is easier and takes around 15 minutes. The local supermarket has basic stuff and takes cash only. Cash is the preferred way of payment in the area  so make sure you have enough of it. Enjoy your stay :-) Response from Ευσταθιος September 2021 Thank you for notifications!! I will take in mind
49580547,Petr August 2021 Great location  1 min from the beach  other beautiful beaches in walking distance. The flat is nice  there is excellent view from the terrace. The hosts are very kind and helpful. Good restaurants and bars around. I can't think of anything else to expect from a perfect summer holidays....
49580547,"Alexandra June 2021 The small and simply equipped studio of Stathis ""The sound of the sea "" lives up to its name:  You wake up with the sound of the sea and go to sleep with the sound of the sea. The wonderful view of the sea and the immediate proximity to the beach make the studio something very special.  A small supermarket is within walking distance and is open every day. Directly on the beach you will find several restaurants and bars and the wonderful mountain village of pelekas is also in the immediate vicinity and you will find here several nice restaurants  bars and cafes that are worth a visit.  We had a wonderful time here and Stathis was always helpful when we had a request. Especially his sister  who lives with her husband under the studio has always supported us in all everyday concerns very friendly and loving and made our stay here something very special.  Thank you Stathis and thank you to your sister for everything Show more"

22709200,Pierre-Etienne September 2022 Great stay in Kouramades. Stamatis and Elena are really reactive and provided good information about places to visit. The small house is very nice and convenient. And the neighbors very friendly. It is a good place to visit both Corfu city and the beautiful west beaches.
22709200,Melanie July 2022 We loved staying in this traditional village home in Kouramades! The home was very comfortable  quaint  and lovely  and it met all our needs. I especially loved my quiet mornings on the terrace while my family still slept. I would enjoy fresh harvested grapes from the vines above  while having my coffee  reading my book  and people watching as the neighbors would make their way to buy fresh local bread. We were also fortunate enough to be there during the annual village “panagiri” (festival)  which was a highlight of our stay in Kouramades. We hope we have the occasion to return to this home  and cannot recommend it highly enough.
22709200,Emma June 2022 If you like to stay somewhere out of the way of all the tourist hotspotsthis is the perfect place. Very quiet village and a great base for exploring the island. Stamatis & Elena are great hosts and even though we didn't meet them in person their instructions on how to find the place and tips on where to go were very helpful. We rented a car and found some lovely beaches and explored the island during our stay.
22709200,Jolien May 2022 Despite our late arrival we were warmly welcomed by a friend of Stamatis & Elena. The appartment had everything we needed and even more (some fresh water  fruits  coffee and tea). We especially liked the little terrace under the grapevine where we could enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning. Stamatis spoiled us with a lot of recommendations  a nice souvenir and his kind way of communicating. If you want to enjoy a quiet stay in a little Greek village  but closeby te airport and Corfu Town  we highly recommend this AirBnB!! Greetings from the 3 Belgian girls.
22709200,Carmen May 2022 nicely decorated  peaceful location  historical building but all modern conveniences. Iwas greatly touched by the stand up fan in the bedroom in addition to the AC. All bases covered. There were multiple coffee makers so having coffee the way you wish is easy peasy. Did I mention the washing machine? The residents were very kind and welcoming. One teenage boy saw how happy Iwas when I saw and petted his dog on their walk. So he came by the next two evenings! We ate at the village restaurant. All fresh ingredients. very very tasty. Just a wonderful home to stay in with a welcoming location. We will definitely return.
22709200,Annabel April 2022 The apartment was really beautiful and we had two awesome weeks there. It is a very nice and a sweet apartmant with all you need for a good vacation. The Village is very charming. Supermarkets and Pharmacy is not far away.  Stamatis and Elena are very good hosts and are answering very fast. we can recommend this Appartmen to everyone who wants to have a great Vacation.  With best regards Annabel and Jeremy
22709200,Liga July 2021 The Traditional House in Corfu located in Koumarades is a perfect place to stay for a vacation for a couple or three persons! You can enjoy a calm and welcoming atmosphere in the small town having a nice breakfast at the terrace and both getting to any place on the Korfu within an hour. Beautiful beaches for a swim  leisure  or viewpoints for sunset/sunrise are within a short drive from the house  and also the Olf Korfu and airport is within a 15-20 minute drive. We were met by Michalis at our arrival and got suggestions for amazing local spots for eating out and beaches  as well as recommendations from Stamatis and Elena. We could only wish to have the option to try them all - that's for the next time :) Would recommend having a car for your stay in Korfu - during a week we travelled all around the island enjoying the sea and beaches  nature  landscapes  wine and olive-oil degustation and the food! And the lovely and welcoming locals! Both Mihalis and Stamatis were in quick reach if we needed anything and they are one of the best hosts we have ever had! We recommend Stamatis-Elena place to everybody who appreciates an authentic stay and would definitely stay at their place next time in Korfu. Show more
22709200,Anastasia August 2020 We had an amazing stay at Stamatis’ and Elena’s place! The house is lovely - ideal for a couple or young family. The house is well equipped and beautifully decorated. The hosts were extremely nice and friendly (although unfortunately we didn’t meet them in person but met very friendly co-host Michalis!) and were always available to answer any queries. Upon arrival we also found some welcoming touches - like bread from local bakery  fruits and house wine - which was so lovely. The location (village Kouramades) is great - picturesque and friendly locals  also close to beaches and generally well located if you want to visit different parts of the island. We would certainly recommend this place if you want to visit and enjoy Corfu!
22709200,Ian September 2019 You will be met by Michalis who will guide you to the property. We travelled to Kouramades by bus as we had stayed elsewhere in Corfu the week before  the bus is reliable and the stop is less than 100 meters to the door. Kouramades is a quiet  village. You won't find many visitors there and so is perfect if you just want peace and quiet. There's a village shop  but the bus to Corfu stops by Lidl Supermarket (there are other big supermarkets on the bus route) for you to stock up for the week. The bus to Corfu takes about 25 minutes. Sinarades is a 15 - 20 minute walk away and you'll find a couple of mini-markets and cafes and tavernas  don't forget to visit the local museum. You can get fresh bread every morning bar Sunday from the local baker  he opens between 10.00 & 12.00  you have to try the doughnuts (you may need to order the day before). The accommodation is spacious and clean  the owners father was an artist and the wall are covered with his prints. Would highly recommend this as a place to escape the hustle and bustle of the Corfiot resorts. Response from Stamatis October 2019 Ian & Louise you are exceptional people and we will be very happy to see you again.
22709200,Jan September 2019 Here is your chance to stay in a small Greek village in a traditional house and still be in Corfu town in 30 minutes by bus. Very attentive host and a very memorable stay.
22709200,Ivana June 2019 Really nice  clean place with with more than enough necessities (spare towels  sheets  cleaning products  etc.) and very attentive host. We had a really nice week there. Response from Stamatis June 2019 Ivana thank you so much for your compliments!!!!!! It was our pleasure to host you!!!! :)
22709200,Lisa June 2019 We spend some relaxing days at the house and felt very comfortable. Due to the weather and because of our baby we were inside the house a lot and we enjoyed to have quite some space  a nice interior and air-conditioning. Also the bed was extremely comfortable! Michalis  the co-host was super friendly and helped us whenever we needed him. The location was great  good for excursions with the car and small walks around the village with a nice view. Check out the bakery-guy and the very tasty bread! Response from Stamatis June 2019 Thank you so much Lisa for your kindness!!! It was really a pleasure having you and your family in our house! Hope to see you again in the future!!!
22709200,Elena October 2018 We were lucky to find this place and spend here a few days. The village is very small and even cozy  all residents including cats and dogs are incredibly friendly. The beauty of this place is evidenced by the fact that during our stay a historical movie was filmed there. A great bonus was the lack of light and the ability to observe the stars at night  as well as warm bread from the local bakery in the mornings. The apartment has a separate entrance and a small area in the courtyard for unhurried breakfasts) The kitchen is well equipped  including even a waffle iron. The oven works great. Kostas promptly met us in the evening  showed the way right to the house  gave all the recommendations  and even provided us with fruits and water. Highly recommended!!
22709200,Petros September 2018 Our stay at home was amazing. very clean  comfortable  in a very nice location  and the village is beautiful. Ιs recommended!!! Response from Stamatis October 2018 It is our pleasure that you have spent wonderful time in our village. I wish to see you again
22709200,Gil September 2018 Kouramades is a nice Village and the stay at their house was nice and easy!
22709200,Caterina July 2018 The house is located in a small but amazing village  in a few minutes and kilometers you are in Corfù town and in some famous beaches like Agios Gordios! In the village you can find some essential services like a little market (they have delicious feta!) and a bakery (try their donuts!!!). The house is small but comfortable. We are in four - me  my husband  my 9 months old daughter and our little dog- and we have all the space and the comfort we need. In the house there are also the essential things to feel like at home! I also appreciate the flowers  the croissants  fresh fruit and water when we arrived and also the present when we leave! Kostas was very kind and he was very helpful! I also like the neighborhood  also the oldest people that can also speak greech (so it was an hard communication) show kindness to us and to hour baby! Response from Stamatis August 2018 It was a pleasure for us that you have spent great holidays at traditional house at Corfu. I wish you and your family all the best!!!
22709200,Kirsten July 2018 My husband and I had a very pleasant stay in this accommodation. The apartment was very clean with some thoughtful touches and well-equipped.

22709200,Olesia June 2018 Traditional house of Elena and Stamatis was just wonderful! We searched for longtime the place like that: not touristic village  comfortable house for two persons with cozy yard. This house was respond for all our preferences. Kouramades is the ancient  picturesque  small and quiet village in the centre of island. There are one church  one cemetery  one shop and one cafe like in tales. All the neighbours was very nice and friendly people. From the village 10 minute to drive to the good beaches in Agios Gordios or 20 to the many beaches of west shore. The car is obviously needed  because buses is not so comfortable for explore island. That was speech about the environemetnt. About the accommodation: house of Stamatis and Elena is very and very domestic  careful  warm and comfortable. In the house we had all the stuff like dishes  cups  soap  hairdryer  washing machine  air conditioner  cozy and big wardrobe (for hiding suitcases)  mirrors  towels and else. Near the house is a big garden with many birds  dogs and their voices  so may be will be useful to take earplugs for the nights. Antique furniture was carefully restored and using that was like a pleasure. Free parking was in 30 meters from the house just on the road. Our host - Kostas was very helpfull  polite and kind - he even bought the water  bread and fresh fruit for our first evening. So  we was are really happy to stay here and thank you so much Elena  Stamatis and Kostas. P.S.

22709200,Elke August 2022 We felt very comfortable in the house from the beginning. The small terrace in front of the house is nice and shaded  for sitting  eating  reading  resting. The neighbours were very friendly and the village is away from any tourist hustle and bustle. There is a mini market for the essentials and a very cute little bar/mini tavern with small delicious entrees in the middle of the village  where you can eat in the evening from 8 pm and watch the hustle and bustle of the village. Parking works in front of the house  a little further away at the cemetery. It's really quiet at night  just the sound of little owls makes a homely vibe. It's been relaxing weeks!

22709200,Marzena July 2021 I spent two wonderful weeks with my family. The house was a great choice. The village is small  the life runs lazy rather than in the big city  the people who are very kind... this is what I needed on vacation. There is a bus that takes you to the village  from the capital  almost every day. It is very well connected to the capital  from which buses depart to other important towns on the island. The closest beach   very nice is Agios Gordios  just a few minutes by bus. Contacting your host is super  providing any information you might need right away. Mihalis is a friendly person  kind and helpful. I will remember my stay in Kouramades for a long time. It was a wonderful time. Thank you😀😘 Translated from Polish  Show original

Change of scenery and local place to recommend without hesitation!!!! Annie and Vincent Translated from French  Show original Response from Stamatis July 2019 Thank you so much for your kind words!

22709200,Anna May 2018 THE HOME IS VERY THOUGHTFUL AND COZY. IT IS VERY CLEAN AND PROVIDES YOU WITH THE WHAT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR IS IN A GREAT LOCATION BECAUSE IT IS IN A VERY PICTURESQUE AND QUIET VILLAGE WHILE VERY CLOSE TO THE BEACHES AND THE CITY OF THE ISLAND. TURKEY IS BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND THE HOUSE IS IN THE MOST IDEAL LOCATION FOR ALL EXCURSIONS. THE HOST IS VERY KIND  AND THE CO-HOST IS VERY WELCOMING! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

48517917,Dan October 2022 !!!5*+ rating!!! - what a great place - makes you speechless. Can't be closer to the beach! nicest sun set in the world! very nice and responsive host! a super cool little cabin  which just has everything you need and very cosy interior! for cooking and the rest there is just everything.... even a dishwasher and washing machine... we have been there for three weeks with three kiddos and was one of our best holidays. Also the village Agios Matheos close by has everything... if you don't like it there  I can't really help you.. :-).... 100%+ recommendation! we will come again!
48517917,Sarena September 2022 We had a wonderful weeklong stay at the cabin - highlights included: the total seclusion  the beach as our front yard  the comfortable bed and living spaces  the patio and deck for reading and sunning  the outdoor shower  the well stocked kitchen (including groceries with all we needed for breakfast  snacks and happy hour) and the excellent restaurant a short walk away on the other side of the beach. Honestly there is no compelling reason to leave  though we did venture out with our rental car twice to explore more of the island. Hosts Daphne and Lisa couldn’t be more welcoming and accommodating. The cabin was one of our top Airbnb stays and we’d return in a heartbeat!
48517917,Meg September 2022 We hoped the photos  description and reviews lived up to expectations and they really did! This was the perfect quiet and secluded place to unwind close to nature. Perfect in every way. Super hosts. Thank you Daphne and Lisa! We would love to return.
48517917,Eva-Maria September 2022 We loved our stay in the Seaharmony cabine! It’s just beautiful & the perfect spot for relaxing & recharging. Daphne & her Mum Lisa even got us some breakfast  which was just lovely. They told us all the local infos like restaurants  bars & activities. We will definitely come back for another visit 🥰 we had the best time just enjoying the sun & the sea. Thanks for everything  take care Eva & Tobi 🥰
48517917,Verena September 2022 This spot is really amazing. We loved to sit on the terrace and watch the turquoise sea - feeling a bit like on a lonely island far away from everyone. hearing the sound of the sea all day long was wonderful. Daphne is a great and helpful host  always ready to give advice. You can feel that this is a family home  as there is everything provided you could think of. even fresh grapes and prickly pears  rosmarin and mint were growing in the garden.
48517917,Karsten August 2022 We stayed 1 week at Sea Harmony and we could have stayed forever! The place is gorgeous! You have to walk down some steep steps to get there  but then you have the ocean at your feet and a wonderful view and it feels really secluded and private. We received a very warm welcome  with a basket full of food for the first breakfasts. The beachhut is really well equipped  parasol and mats for the beach  snorkelling gear  lots of towels  the kitchen has everything you need and beds are comfy. Only problem  it`s so nice you don`t want to leave! We will be back :-)
48517917,Katie August 2022 Absolutely great. As described  well worth the effort to reach this gem of a cabin. Really well kitted out with all you need  and a very generous welcome basket. Lisa and Daphne are marvellous hosts. Thank you both
48517917,Marlene August 2022 The beach cabin is a really special place and a wonderful hideaway in a calm area. Perfect for relaxing and calming down in a private surrounding. There is no need of packing heavy  everything is already provided (towels  yoga mats  goggles). The cabin is nicely decorated and you can see the afford of details in every corner. Communication with Daphne is super fast and easy going  she replied within minutes and prepared lots of recommendations. A small dishwasher and the possibility to drink water from tap were important and improved our stay a lot. Be careful when driving to the parking lot  the road is in a bad condition and you have to be an safe driver to deal with it. We are definitely keen on visiting the beach cabin again!
48517917,Jim July 2022 The cabin is one of those rare places you feel lucky (and slightly smug) to have found - amazing tranquil tucked-away private location with beautiful views & sunsets  it’s well-equipped  comfortable and the only noise is the sea & the cicadas. Access is not for the infirm or faint-hearted  but worth every step! Good  super-friendly taverna at the other end of the beach  boats to hire etc. Daphne & Lisa are lovely attentive hosts and nothing is too much trouble - thank you  we absolutely loved it!
48517917,Eva July 2022 The little house near the beach in Paramonas is the perfect spot to spend your holidays. The unique house is very beautiful and gives the opportunity to be isolated from the very touristic regions of Corfu. It is located near to lots of beautiful beaches (also private ones)  but you definitely need a car. Everything was very clean and well equipped.
48517917,"James July 2022 While going down the +30 steps down to Paramonas Beach we knew this place was special. Once there we only saw the blue water  rocky/sandy shoreline  and  10 meters away  another trail leading up to the oleander shrouded cabin with no other homes in sight.  Passing through the front gate brings you to the deck  which like the photos  is multi-purpose with sitting areas in the sun with full ocean views  shade with oleander and grape vines hugging the trellis above  and perfectly bookended with outdoor shower and garden.  The inside of the cabin has great ""beach"" style and many of the custom hand built elements along with added interior details that are worthy of many Pinterest ""Cool Beach House"" collections. The kitchen has an excellent view with fully opening windows to let the breeze come through the dining area and adjacent living room. The bedrooms plenty big for us and the beds were very comfortable and each had ceiling fans  air-conditioners  and tented bug netting around the beds. The 1.5 baths came in handy for our family. The internet is solid  there is a good selections of DVDs for the tv  and a bunch of books to peruse.  We purchased food at nearby Agios Matteos' Supermarket for our breakfast and lunch needs  then took advantage of the Sunset Restaurant which is just 150 meters down the beach. Often we would just order take-away and eat back at the cabin.  The water outside the cabin is nice for swimming. You have to dance over the cantaloupe sized rocks to enter  but once in there were plenty of fish for my daughter to get excited about to see while snorkeling and the swimming was ideal.  If you are looking for the services and luxury of a resort  this may not be right for you. However  if you like a touch of remoteness and proximity to nature  in a super cool beach house  steps from the Ionian  with an occasional lizard  this is the place. Show more"
48517917,Elitza June 2022 Magical and lovely cabin on the water  remote and quiet. Gave my family the perfect setting to chill  enjoy the sea  spend time together and share meals. If you are looking for a remote  quiet setting  with a great host  and are ok to climb the 70 big steps leading from the car to the water front/cabin this is the place. Daphne and Lisa are wonderful  helped us carry our things and settle in the cabin and helped us find a great car mechanic for a car issue. We are coming back!
48517917,Priscilla & Yannik June 2022 This place is a paradise! We recommend to 100%. When in Corfu - stay here!
48517917,Rowan October 2021 This is a truly special place. Utterly peaceful  private and surrounded by trees and the sound of the ocean. Daphane and Lisa were perfect hosts and the cabin is equipped with everything we could need. One of the favourite places we have ever stayed and we will be back. Thank you.
48517917,Archie September 2021 The perfect place to relax and unwind by the sea. Great tavernas nearby and the best sun sets!
48517917,Tristan September 2021 This is such an idyllic spot for a holiday. The cabin is amazingly well stocked for everything you could imagine needing and there was plenty of supplies (breakfasts  drinks etc.) already in the cabin so we didn't really need to shop at all. The deck has a beautiful view over the sea  perfect for sunset yoga or just reading a book. I didn't want to leave at the end of our stay.
48517917,Sébastien August 2021 Thanks again  we enjoy a lot the cabin.
48517917,KH & Stéphanie August 2021 This beach cabin is the right mix between Robinson Crusoe (with some luxury) and Paradise (but alive).
48517917,Mich July 2021 Sea harmony cabin is a real gem. The views are absolutely stunning  the sound of the waves super relaxing  the place has the most amazing character  quirky but decorated with taste  clean  and comfy. Daphne is a wonderful and caring host. We’d love to come back one day. In the meantime  we are recommending it to anyone who is visiting the island and is looking for a beautiful piece of the universe just for themselves and the loved ones.
48517917,Beth July 2021 Had a great stay at Sea Harmony. The property is really well equipped and the setting is wonderful. We enjoyed spending our time relaxing on the terrace listening to the sound of the sea  it was even nicer than the pictures. We definitely want to return.
48517917,Carly July 2022 This place is amazing in every way! We enjoyed it so much with our two children aged 12 and 14. The cottage has everything: beautiful views  the sound of the sea continuously from every room  everywhere the wonderful smells of the beautiful plants in the garden  fine chairs for the sun or in the shade  an outdoor shower  mosquito net  all kinds of cooking utensils to work on your own (because you don't want to leave). I was a little hesitant about Corfu  thought it was very touristy  and we certainly saw those places as well. But  the interior and the villages around Paramonas are beautifully rugged and authentic. There is more than enough to explore  but don't do too much  because you don't want to miss chilling out at this beautiful house. Lisa and Daphne  thank you for your warm welcome and see you soon! Translated from Dutch  Show original
48517917,Steffen June 2022 We were warmly welcomed by Daphne and her mother. You have a real small paradise all to yourself  furnished with a lot of love. If you like simple beautiful things  love nature and tranquility  this is the place to be. We have never been so close to the sea  the veranda with the yoga deck is fantastically beautiful. Amenities are missing nothing. For arrival  shopping has already been done for us. Thank you very much for this nice service😘. Paramonas Beach is a charming little beach town with boat rentals and three taverns within walking distance of the beach. In the Sunset we ate very well several times  the host even speaks German. Daphne is a great hostess  gives excursion tips and was always available. Sea Harmony Cabin is now a longing place for us and we will definitely be back. Translated from German  Show original
35380221,Shenaiah October 2022 Kayo apartments allowed us to experience Greece in the perfect way  this Airbnb is clean  safe and secure  Xristina and her husband are amazing hosts that make you feel welcomed and at home  we were confident to communicate with them quick and easy  the location is just outside corfu town  with easy access with buses or cars  a nice walk from the main road where there are many supermarkets  we recommend ‘Nostos’. We will definitely make a return to Kayo apartments  everything was perfect.
35380221,Pim October 2022 We had a wonderful stay at the beautiful place Xristina has. The apartment had everything we needed and more. We had a very warm welcome by our hosts and would definitely come back here.
35380221,Carolin September 2022 We can very much recommend to stay at Xristina‘s apartment: the house and garden with the three apartments for guests is a beautiful and calm place to stay with very close proximity to the city and the airport. At the same time it is really easy to get to almost every destination in Corfu within 15-60 minutes by car and the house is situated in a residential area in the hills that feels rather rural and is very calm and quiet. (The two main roads with a lot of big supermarkets and fast access to the beautiful coastline in the west are a 2-5 minutes’ drive by car through the neighborhood.) Xristina and her husband are exceptionally nice hosts and the apartment is equipped with everything you need (olive oil from their own gardens  shampoo  washing machine  etc)  so we felt immediately at home and it was such a treat to spend our last three nights on the island at their place. The apartment itself is tastefully designed  spotlessly clean and very modern. We had some very rainy weather but thanks to the beauty and relaxing atmosphere of the apartment and its central location we could enjoy the time by cooking dinner  visiting Corfu town and even starting on a little hike and swim on the west coast after a break from the rain.
35380221,Traian September 2022 Great accommodation  great hosts  the property is very clean  equipped with everything you need for a great stay. The apartment is spotless  modern furnished with nice bathrooms  the kitchen is fully equipped so you can cook your own food. Air conditioning and wi-fi are working properly. The hosts were very friendly and helpful with information. I would recommend to bring or rent a car to explore all beach areas and restaurants around the island.
35380221,Markus July 2022 It was a Great Stay with wonderful hosts. The place is very lovely and really clean. Xristina and her husband were always available and gave us great recommendations. I highly recommend renting a car since the public Transport is not the best.
35380221,Isabel June 2022 We had the best stay at Xristina and Stathis! They were so nice and everything was just like in the pictures. Very clean and beautifully decorated.
35380221,Marco June 2022 We loved the apartment. It was very clean and equipped with everything you need during your stay. Xristina and her husband are very attentive and friendly persons. We even enjoyed the tiny and sweet delights commonly made on corfu which were placed in the kitchen.  Hope to be there again soon. Many thanks.
35380221,Russell June 2022 Xristina is wonderful! Very friendly  hospitable  accomodating  and helpful. And such a beautiful place to stay as well!
35380221,Dida May 2022 What a lovely place with lovely people! The apartment was so beautifull and clean! There was also a beautifull garden!! We enjoyed our stay so much!!
35380221,Martin May 2022 Like a little gem  about 15-20 mins drive to Corfu town (10 mins drive to Corfu airport)  so not too far  but also quiet & private. There are 3 airbnb apartments located on this family house/grounds where the family grow their own vegetables & have chickens too! Enough parking space for 1 car per Airbnb. Feels luxury. Done to high standard. Nice patio area. Xristina & Stathis very friendly & welcoming  Stathis gave us a lovely tour of the grounds.
35380221,Julia April 2022 We had such a good time at Xristinas place. She and her husband are such lovely people and did everything they could to make our stay great. They even placed some typical Corfu specialties as a gift in our apartment. The apartment is perfect for two and the whole place is just wonderful  green and like a little oasis super close to Corfu town. We’d come back any time! :)
35380221,Quang April 2022 We had a very nice stay at the apartment. We had everything what we needed and the location is near to popular destinations. If we visit corfu again we would ask for the Apartment! Thank you for your kindness and hospitality!
35380221,Andre April 2022 Like Tina Turner said: “You’re simply the best!!!” Best accommodation this side of the island. You will love everything. Hard working folks keep this hidden gem in excellent condition. And the cat Lilly is sooooooo adorable 🥰 We enjoyed our stay thank you

35380221,Lukas October 2021 We loved our stay at Xristina & Stathis place! The Apartment is super modern  very clean and cozy. It offers everything you could need. The garden invites you to relax with a beautiful view. Fresh picked fruit makes it perfect! We easily reached everything in under one hour from our location as it is in the centre of the islands. To Corfu town it only takes you 10min. In addition Xristina and Stathis are wonderful hosts  they welcomed us very warmly & always helped us out with questions. We can recommend this beautiful appartement for 100 percent. Thank you so much!
35380221,Lisa October 2021 We hat a great time at the apartment  everything was just perfect! Even when the weather was bad  it was the best place to stay and felt like home. We would definitely recommend!

35380221,Marta August 2021 Xristina & Stathis were an amazing hosts. They greeted us and explained everything. Studio is absolutely stunning with beautiful garden and access to fresh fruit. Probably one of the best places we’ve stayed using the AirBnb services just a shame we came only for few days and couldn’t experience it to the fullest. We have had all we needed and couldn’t fault a single thing. Place was super clean with all the necessary utilities. Xristina and Stathis  lovely couple  very helpful and looked after us well. Location is superb  super quiet and only 10min to the town. Lots of shops  restaurants etc close by. I would and will recommend this place to others. Thank you for having us 🤗
35380221,Konstanze August 2021 Xristina and Stathis are wonderful  helpful and courteous hosts! The apartment is beautiful  modern  exceptionally clean and perfectly equipped! We were greeted with corfiote specialities and fresh fruits! In front of the apartment is a garden and the olive orchard of Xristina and Stathis  it’s very beautiful and quiet located. The apartment is also perfectly located to explore the whole island and you are in the old town of Corfu city in approx. 15 min by car. We had a great holiday and we will be very happy to come back the next time we will be in Corfu!
35380221,George July 2021 We stayed recently at Kristina’s & Stathis place and was perfect! Beautiful apartment  same as the pictures  well equipped  super nice location and garden/terrace to rest and chill  host great  they were genuinely welcoming and gave us a lot of information. Would definitely recommend the place  you won’t get disappointed!
35380221,"Marius July 2021 We can definetely recommend this apartment. The owners are lovely. We stayed for two weeks at Kayo Apartments. Xristina and her husband welcomed us very friendly. They gave us a list with ""Highlights"" in Corfu and explained us everything about the apartment. During our stay they asked us if we need fresh towels or something else. So we felt very comfortable. Furthermore everything looks like it's written on the Airbnb website. The neighbourhood is very silent. To sum it up if you're looking for a great ""homebase"" in Corfu to sleep  this is the right place.  All the best for Xristina and her husband in this extraordinary times  Best wishes  Victoria and Marius"
35380221,Olivia June 2021 We stayed 6 nights at Xristina's place and it was just awesome! Super-clean  comfy and stylish apartment. There is everything you might need. The garden is beautiful  you can sit outside and it is quiet. We recommend hiring a car to get around the island! The apartment is in a good location to go into all directions. Xristina's tips were very helpful for getting around and exploring the island. We warmly recommend this place and their fantastic hosts :)
35380221,Marvin October 2020 Xristina and Stathis were exceptionally kind and helpful. They have a beautiful garden out of which Stathis let us taste some gems. The setting of this Airbnb is perfect to relax and let your mind wander. We would definitely come here again!
35380221,Jessica September 2020 Great facility with amazing garden and view  very lovely interior with everything you need. Wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t have a car  quite hard to reach.

35380221,Grace September 2020 Xristina’s apartment is an ideal place to stay away from crowds and busy streets of Corfu main town. The apartment had everything we could need and more. Xristina recommended a wide range of places for us to visit in Corfu and also helped organise a rental car for us. All of the recommendations were for great places and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
35380221,Julia August 2020 Great apartment and lovely hosts. We enjoyed our time and can highly recommend the place as a perfect silent spot on corfu.

Hopefully  we will come back here again!
35380221,Mo October 2019 The apartment was immaculate and tidy. Better then I expected and the super super hosts make it a 5 star experience.  Just minutes away from the airport and Corfu town so you are away in peace no hustle and bustle. With the help and information form the host we managed to get around the island and wander all the hidden gems of Corfu. Ideal location to get around.  We will be returning most definitely.

It was squeeky clean  kitchen was fully equipped  the interior design was beautiful and the room was generally a joy to come back to after a day in the sun and the beaches. Xristina's apartments are very close to the main road and it's very easy to get to the old town of Corfu and also to different beaches. The rural area where the apartments are  offers a serene escape from the busy roads and the busy town. Another welcome suprise was that early in the morning the sun rises over the picturesque landscape in the front view of the rooms. Xristina also offered us local produce  corfiot olive oil and eggs from her chickens which was a warm touch just as we arrived. Generally speaking  she was an excellent hostess always trying to cater to our every need. The whole family was very helpful and very friendly. We would totally recommend it and we look forward to visiting again in the future!

35380221,Laura July 2022 The place is exactly as described. Very nice and furnished with attention to detail. As soon as you enter the property you notice a difference from the surroundings. Really everything is clean  tidy  very well maintained and beautiful. We also particularly enjoyed the garden. The apartment really has everything you want. Everything was on site (coffee filters  laundry detergent shower bathroom  shampoo spices iron oils gift basket...). You definitely need a car to get to the accommodation and you are much more mobile. So really rent a car for the whole time. The house is quietly located on a mountain. Nevertheless  you are relatively quickly in the lively old town of Corfu city. The beaches are also within easy reach. A great place to relax in the evening. Translated from German  Show original

35380221,Patricia June 2022 We had a wonderful time in Xristina's apartment! It was very clean and as described in the photos. We also found the bed very comfortable - not too soft and not too firm. The location is perfect for a vacation on Corfu: very centrally located and thus the east as well as the west coast  the south or the north can be easily reached. Shopping ( LIDL / very well stocked  almost like in Germany!) can be reached in 10 minutes by car. Xristina and her husband were very warm and attentive. We offered us new towels + bed linen  or brought fresh fruit and eggs from the garden. We would book this apartment again at any time and can fully recommend it!

35380221,Katharina October 2021 Xristina and her husband welcomed us warmly  were super likeable and always accessible hosts. The apartment was very clean  the equipment left nothing to be desired  everything was available from baking paper to self-pressed oil.  The path to the apartment is a bit steep and stone  but in Greece it is almost normal. You get used to it.  The location is very quiet and idyllic  the garden is very large and the terrace is beautifully sunny in the morning until noon.  Goodbye was also very warm. We highly recommend Kayo apartments!

35380221,Nassima September 2019 Xristina & Stathis were lovely hosts. The accommodation offered is perfect  we had a great relaxing week without getting bored.

Xristina and her husband are very hospitable. They picked us up right from the port to take us to the rental. Rarely  hosts will pick you up from the airport or port!

Translated from French  Show original

15712099,Rebecca August 2022 Amazing roof top pool with a beautiful view! We had a lovely holiday in Nissaki and enjoyed getting to know the local area. We would recommend Street Taverna on the main road and Thalassos in Kaminaki beach. The best supermarket is Katrina’s which is a short drive away from the villa but it is well stocked and the owners are lovely. The kids also did a diving taster session at Apollo dive centre on Nissaki beach - it was brilliant  they were so attentive and the kids loved it! If you go to Nissaki beach  it’s also worth stopping at Mary’s Lab for food and drinks - the owner was so welcoming and the food and location great. We didn’t want to come home  thank you Sofronios and Eos! You made our stay very memorable.

15712099,Anita July 2019 It would be worth booking this villa for the fantastic roof terrace and view alone. However on top of that you also get a really efficient and friendly service from Stefanos and the EOS team.

The resort is quiet which we wanted and we didn't have a car but this wasn't a problem as the Green Bus service was a really easy way to visit Corfu Old Town. Would definitely recommend.

15712099,Brian June 2019 Villa Alexandros is a gem of a property and was the perfect place for our large party. Needless to say (just look at the photos!) the property is gorgeous. The pool upstairs provides hours and hours of fun for our two boys (and us!) and the various patios hosted many al fresco dining opportunities. My 90 year old grandmother  who has limited mobility  joined us and while we were concerned about her ability to navigate the many steps  was able to access all spots within the property thanks to the layout and sturdy rails along the stairs that connect the floors. All-in-all  Villa Alexandros was the ideal home for our stay. We couldn’t have asked for anything more of the property or staff. Response from Sofronios July 2019 Dear Brian   Hello from Eos Villas.

15712099,Ruth May 2019 Beautiful villa with stunning views! The villa and pool were very clean. Local beach access is a 15-20 minute walk. Local tavernas (Roumeli was our favorite!) and small market & cafe are within a 10-15 minute walk. EOS Travel arranged a rental van for us at a reasonable price. We greatly appreciated this since Old Corfu Town was a 30-min drive from the villa and driving was a nice alternative to taking the bus. Be sure to close window shutters at dusk to avoid mosquitoes  as there are no screens in the windows. We'd definitely rent this villa again if we vacation in Corfu!

15712099,Suzanne May 2019 This is a spacious and well equipped villa  in the quiet village of Nisaki. The villa is up a steep road  and there are several sets of stairs to get to the three levels - two levels of villa and the rooftop where the pool is  so it's possibly not ideal for those with impaired mobility. We also accidentally locked ourselves out so make sure you don't pull the main door closed unless you have the key on you! There is a local small supermarket who will collect you and drop you off with shopping which was invaluable without a car  as we were. You can also text orders and they'll deliver. There are tavernas within walking distance too - with fantastic views out over the water. The villa has bedrooms with doors that open onto balconies  the top floor of which has views out over the sea which was such a lovely way to start each morning. There is air con  a smart tv  and a good range of kitchen equipment for self catering  and a dining area inside and in two areas outside. The beds are a large and comfy with plenty of pillows. But the standout feature is undoubtedly the rooftop which is just incredible. The villa is built into the hill  so you are surrounded by olive trees. The rooftop has a swimming pool  and a multitude of sunbeds and seating areas including a swing  from which you can relax and take in the breathtaking views out across the sea. Waking up and ending the day with that view was just amazing. A really lovely place. Show more Response from Sofronios May 2019 Dear Suzanne  Good morning from Eos Villas.

Well kept and clean villa inside. We were grateful for the easy correspondence with the owners and for them taking time to come by and check everything was ok. Thank you for a great stay!

15712099,Minori June 2018 This villa truly surpasses all expectations and offers more than these pictures could ever show. It is a clean  homely space where friends or family can get together to enjoy some time away in the sun. Sofronios is a great point of contact  always eager to help. We hired a mini bus for the 8 guests that were staying to transfer from the airport to the villa and this worked out great. The information pack about the villa and its surrounding areas is also extremely helpful as you don't feel lost. Sofronios is always a phone call  e-mail or text away which is reassuring.  The villa is situated in-between two beaches  Kaminaki beach and Nisaki beach. There is a supermarket 10 minutes away that delivers to the house as well. The local tavernas are great as well  though our favourite has been Roumeli Taverna which is all homemade. We also learned from the restaurant owners that there is a green bus that goes to Ipsos  Cassiopi and even Corfu Town  which we visited. They are cheap tickets for less than 3 euro one-way so there is a lot to explore.  The cleanliness and organisation was superb. Definitely would recommend this place and host to anyone!

15712099,Leila June 2018 This place is wonderful. We went as a family  grandma and grandpa with their three sons  wives/girlfriends and one infant. It looks better than the photos and we thoroughly enjoyed the terrace  the pool  amazing view and handy amenities. The kitchen was fully furnished and someone came to clean while we were there as well. You will definitely want a car while staying there  and it's perfectly situated away from the throngs of tourists while close to the sights. Enjoy!

15712099,Rob May 2018 Villa Alexandros is a spacious  stunning property in an amazing location. The views from the top terrace over the sea towards Corfu town are incredible.

15712099,Lisa October 2017 The rooftop terrace of this villa was just stunning!! Even more beautiful than the picture. It is so private and secluded too - you can see no neighbours as you are right in the middle of an olive grove. The house was great too  well equipped and linen and beds comfortable. We had 2 families staying  10 people in total  and was plenty of room. It's a steep walk down to several little beaches (pebbles) with lovely turquoise water which was still warm enough to swim at the end of October. There are several tavernas within 10 - 15 minutes walk and all were really good! There is a mini supermarket about 15 minutes walk away 'Aphrodities' and as we didn't have a car they delivered free of charge. You could even text a shopping list and it was selected and delivered to you - we had fresh croissants and coffee delivered some mornings! Would highly recommend the villa and the area.

15712099,Carol July 2017 I highly recommend Villa Alexandros to any travel group regardless of age or size of group. We are travelling as one adult with five teenagers aged between 14-16 so no easy task! However at Villa Alexandros everything was made so easy. From airport pick up being organised as well as pick up to local supermarket belonging to Aphrodite and then home again with supplies. Aphrodite also gives her mobile number so anything we needed could be delivered to us very quickly  even from her son's new Pizza shop!! Also information regarding local beaches  boat hire etc. All communication before  during and after our stay was friendly  helpful and clear. The Villa itself was extraordinarily clean and comfortable with quality fittings. Everything was in working order with easy instructions. Wi-fi and TV were excellent (important with 5 teenagers!) The pool and rooftop areas are the best part - amazing views with many seating choices and the pool was large and clean. House and pool cleaners came during our stay and were all friendly  efficient and non-intrusive. This is the perfect holiday villa and I would highly recommend. I am a very fussy and particular traveller so this is saying something! We will certainly be returning. Show more Response from Sofronios July 2017 Dear Carol   Good morning from Eos.

We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can and I feel sorry to hear of the issues you experienced with the hard mattresses.  I have already handed this matter to property owners  but I am afraid that there aren't many things they can do about  as the extreme majority of the mattresses in Corfu (locally made) are of the same anatomic type and quality.

The villa was clean and well stocked  with all the utensils needed in every room and the view at the top of the villa was amazing  even better than the pictures make out! Incredible value for money and the help from George and Stefanos was invaluable  always on call to answer any and all questions I had. As a bonus  the local Supermarket (Aphrodites) was a short walk away and offered free delivery  we were also able to text them an order for food later in the week for a BBQ. Would highly recommend this villa to anyone thinking about visiting Corfu! Response from Sofronios June 2017 Dear Will   Good afternoon from Eos.

15712099,Dominik May 2017 Pictures were fantastic and promising  but this place looks even better live! Great  peaceful place. Very clean  well-equiped  with fantastic view and superb value for money! Very good contact wit owner  cleaning services twice a week  It's hard to find a single thing that was wrong with it (maybe not all beds were double and required moving them in order to create a double and the wi-fi signal was weak in some part of this villa - probably because of it's size :) - but who would use it in a place like that). I highly recommend this spot!  Super miejscówka  łatwy dojazd z lotniska  czysto  wygodnie (nie wszystkie sypialnie mają podwójne łóżka  ale nam to akurat nie przeszkadzało)  wi-fi nie sięga do wszystkich miejsc na dole  ale to żaden problem. Dach jest mega atrakcją - podświetlany  filtrowany basen  pełno leżaków  daszek  stoły  krzesła i ten widok... mistrzostwo! Stosunek cena/jakość wychodzi tu nieporównywalnie lepiej niż nad polskim morzem (niestety...). GORĄCO POLECAM TO MIEJSCE - WYGLĄDA LEPIEJ NIŻ NA FOTKACH!

The roof terrace invites you to linger. The view is fantastically beautiful. We felt very comfortable. Thank you for the wonderful time at Villa Alexandros.

43875104,Mac September 2021 The apartment is very tidy  full of amenities and feels luxurious with the large balcony and incredible views. Small touches throughout the space make it feel considered and appointed. The beds are noticeably comfortable (including the living room’s pull out bed) and the air conditioning. works wonders.  The complex is fantastic. The seaside swimming pool and casual cafe and bar offer a great space for being outdoors and getting refreshed. The beach is just a few steps away from the apartment and features a variety of sun beds as well as long stretches of fine sandy beach to lay on. The sunsets are fantastic and the star gazing is a close competitor.  Vanya is a smart  gracious and generous hospitality and tourism professional.

Vanya is such an excellent host and person. She used to check on us often and was always available for our questions. Glyfada  it’s a stunning beach surrounded by trees-covered cliffs which make it very unique. You can go for walks  go for snorkelling  jet ski  take surf lessons...or just lay down and relax with no much people around you which was priceless due the current situation. Glyfada is situated in the west of Corfu  perfect spot to make day trips and explore the island.

43875104,Lucy August 2020 We are a family of four and we visited Vanya's place in August 2020. We had a wonderful time. Vanya was so helpful and kind and made sure our stay was comfortable. The apartment is cosy  stylish  clean and has a beautiful view of the Ionian Sea. Glyfada itself is a wonderful place to be based with (or without!) children. It's a beautiful bay with warm crystal clear water and one of the highlights was going out snorkelling to see the many beautiful fish. All of the local people we met were friendly and helpful and we felt safe  and happy. We could have gone out on trips to see some sights around Corfu but the lure of the beach was too much and we spent most of the two weeks relaxing! We are really grateful for Vanya's hospitality and thankful that we were able to have such a wonderful holiday in the middle of the madness going on at the moment. We absolutely recommend a stay at Vanya's beautiful apartment!

Vanya answered quickly - whether at night or during the day -  gave us a warm welcome and was always there  when we needed her. The apartment is very close to the beach  two little supermarkets and a beach bar. It’s perfect for trips around Corfu  because it is located at the coast in the middle of the island.

Check in and check out made both personal and was also available for questions the entire time of our stay and in advance. We felt very well taken care of and also got a lot of great tips from Vanya. The apartment is as in the photos - small but not tight and it is all furnished with a lot of attention to detail. We didn't miss anything during our stay. The view from the balcony is the highlight of the apartment as well as its location. It's less than a 5-minute walk to the beach. The apartment also has a parking space. We stayed in Glyfada in September and you temperatures were perfect ( about 28-30°C and almost continuous sunshine). Since our stay was out of peak season  the beach was by no means crowded. The apartment was very clean  new and modern. We highly recommend Vanya and her Air Bnb.  *English:*  Vanya was a very excellent host with outstanding friendliness. She did both check in and check out personally and was available for questions the whole time of our stay and in advance. We felt very well looked after and also got a lot of great tips from Vanya. The flat is just like the photos - small but not cramped and everything is furnished with a great eye for detail. We didn't miss anything during our stay. The view from the balcony is the highlight of the flat  as is its location. It is less than five minutes' walk to the beach. The flat also has a parking space. We were in Glyfada in September and the temperatures were perfect (approx. 28-30°C and almost constant sunshine). As our stay was outside the main season  the beach was not crowded at all. The flat was very clean  new and modern. We can only recommend Vanya and her Air Bnb.

43875104,"Ruth October 2020 We felt really comfortable. Very nicely decorated  very functional for 2 people. Small but nice! The electric cooking pot was a bit used to it  but it all worked out well. From the balcony the view of the sea and the sunsets were great. We were there from 10/8 to 10/15  you should know that only a bar with snacks on the beach and a very poorly sorted mini market are open. The pool is also already closed. However  there are plenty of shops and taverns in the vicinity. A car is essential. We enjoyed the tranquility and sound of the sea. In high summer this beach is certainly quite lively! Always happy to come back in the fall  possibly in little better weather  thank you again Vanya for the very nice communication ! Translated from German  Show original Response from Vanya November 2020 Dear Ruth  thank you so much for your positive rating for your recent visit to SeaBlueCorfu137. The pandemic is a global phenomenon and If any good will come from coronavirus outbreak  it's that we will have a greater appreciation for the little things in life. They may be little  but they are a big chunk of what makes us happy. And for me was a big challenge to stay open at the end of the seаson in view of those circumstances. How I tackled this ""exam""? Should be good  according to the reviews status. Thats why I am incredibly grateful that you choose to be my guests during this period of time and supported me. Till we meet again stay safe.

The house is very well located  in the middle of the island  perfect to visit each corner of it  a car is then needed. Area is very quiet with all commodities nearby.

24752604,Stefano July 2021 The house is perfect for a relaxing holiday. Everything is clean and tidy. There are all needed space and much more. The garden and the patio are so comfortable for meals and relaxing in the evening. The barbecue area is very useful and easy to use. Two bathrooms are very convenient for a family. Furthermore Christina and his father provide us with some nice and tasty gift that we really appreciated. The position is perfect to visit Corfu town  15 min  and many beaches in the range of 10 to 40 minutes by car. This was our first holyday abroad and we are very happy to been there. I highly recommend Christina's place!
24752604,Constanze June 2021 Marilia's House is really great! It is very comfortably furnished  very clean and is equipped with everything for everyday needs. The garden is an absolute highlight  especially if you are there with children. The surrounding area is absolutely quiet because it is off the main road. The central location on the island alone is unbeatable. By rental car you can be in downtown Kerkyra in 15 minutes and at two famous beaches in the west in 10 to 15 minutes. The Aqualand was unfortunately closed during our stay due to the pandemic  but is also only a stone's throw away. The icing on the cake is the hostess Christina  who is a very nice and helpful person  and we were able to get in touch with her very quickly for any questions. We thank Christina for this unforgettable vacation in the beautiful Marilia's House. :-) Response from Christina - Maria June 2021 Thank you Conny for your kind words.We are glad you and your beautiful family enjoyed your holiday at Marilias House. we will be happy to see you again in Corfu.

24752604,Lynn September 2019 Christina and her family make the holiday very special. From the first booking to the special touches with the welcome pack of home made items and even a leaving gift. The house is in a beautiful peaceful location with fantastic views  yet only a short drive to Corfu Town or the beach. The garden is very pretty  spacious and relaxing we didn’t want to leave. Inside the house is very nicely decorated with a huge bed which is so comfortable. We would not hesitate to book again it has been one of our nicest stays anywhere  thank you Christina. Response from Christina - Maria September 2019 Thank you Lynn for your comments..You are very kind
24752604,Florin Alexandru September 2019 I could not recommend more the venue  the hospitality  the warmth and the overall great experience one can have at Christina’s place. The location is perfectly placed on the island  allowing quick access to all points of interest. The house is cosy and provides all you need for a wonderful stay. The garden  the stone and wood deco  the grill and the generous space inside the house  all are great ingredients for a perfect vacation. Christina  her husband and their parents are always ready to answer any question and provide help whenever needed.  Thank you Christina! We are looking forward to coming back the instant we return to Corfu! Response from Christina - Maria September 2019 thank you very much for your good words ... we hope to host you again in Marilia's House
24752604,Jonathan July 2019 a lovely peaceful and convenient place to stay. We were a couple (excellent double bedroom) with two adult kids  one in second upstairs single spacious bedroom and one in living room downstairs on good sofa bed. All had benefit of air-con.  Lovely separate (cool) dining room. Safe and secure. Excellent barbeque outside with wash up area. Good fridge/freezer  cooker  washing machine in bathroom.  About 15 mins into Corfu town so easy for evenings into town. Ideal central location for newcomers to the island (like us) who want to explore both north and south.  Charming host and family. Attentive and hospitable. Response from Christina - Maria July 2019 Thank you for your comments
24752604,Bartosz July 2019 Marilla's House is just what we needed. We travelled with two kids: 4 and 2 5 years old so Christina prepared playground for them which they loved. Wonderful host. Always ready to help. Very good contact via email & mobile. The house is in the middle of the island so you can get everywhere very quickly (if you have car). One of the best beaches in Agios Gordios is 16 minutes away. The house is very clean  comfortable and spacious. Great barbecue area outside and large sunshade where you can enjoy Corfu chillout climate. And if you got hot you can always use air conditioning inside. If we ever visit Corfu again  Marilla's house will be our TOP CHOICE. I highly recommend this place. Response from Christina - Maria July 2019 Thank you for your comments
24752604,Tunde July 2019 We had a really nice time at this house. We traveled with a 2-year-old an upon arrival there was a special play corner set up  which my daughter appreciated very much. Upon arrival  we got homemade jam and there was cold water waiting for us. And we even got preset at the end. The house is really nice  clean and has everything you need for a nice holiday. Kitchen is well equipped  and there was an extra set of clean bedding. We stayed for 9 nights and in the meantime  the house got cleaned and the bedding was changed. There is air conditioning in every room which was much appreciated because of the warm weather. You need a car to get to this place  but after that  it's easy to get to Corfu town. We also traveled a couple of times to the north of the island which is only 1 hour away  so the location is perfect. You can get to multiple beaches in less than 20 minutes.  Unfortunately  we managed to break the washing machine  but within an hour there was some help to clean our wet clothes and within a day the washing machine was fixed  so amazing service.  All in all  it was amazing and I would recommend it to everybody. If we ever go back to Corfu  I would go to Christina's place again.

I hope you enjoyed your holidays and see you again in Corfu and stay in our house.

24752604,Dumitru September 2018 Great villa in a quiet place. The house and the garden are superb  more beautiful then in the pictures. The location on the island is perfect due to proximity to the best beaches and the capital city. Had a great time with my family here  nothing to complain about. The bbq area has an extra  open-door kitchen which comes very handy.  Christina and her family are very friendly and attentive hosts. 10/10 for them and 10/10 for the villa. Definitely would return here when i come back to Corfu Response from Christina - Maria September 2018 thank you for your comments
24752604,Florian September 2022 We had a very nice stay in Maria's house. A car is absolutely necessary  as the house is a bit more remote inland. We were able to relax superbly in the garden  the terrace is very spacious and a large parasol at the table provides shade. The kitchen is also very spacious and well equipped (only a few sharp knives and a 2nd cutting board would be an advantage). Upon our arrival we found water  bread and sweets  which we enjoyed very much. It was a nice welcome by Christina's sister and her father. Christina was always available for questions and was able to help us right away. What's great is that all bedrooms have air conditioning installed. The beds are relatively hard. The location of the house is very centrally located on the island and offers a good starting point for tours (car absolutely necessary). The nearest beaches as well as supermarkets  bakeries are only a 5-15 minute drive away. All in all  we enjoyed the vacation on the island very much and would recommend Maria's house. Thank you for that! Translated from German  Show original Response from Christina - Maria October 2022 Thank you Florian for your kind words. Hope to see you again
24752604,Stephane August 2022 We spent 15 days in Christina's house and all these wonderfully went well! christina is very responsive  we had a small air conditioning problem in one of the bedrooms when we arrived  the next day the problem was solved a technician came to fix the air conditioning! we had the right to small gifts upon arrival and our departure in short there is really nothing to say! the house is very well located close to the nearby beaches ( 15 minutes drive) 1 hour from the north and 1 hour from the south! you can book without any worries everything is perfect.

24752604,Emilio July 2022 It's hard to imagine something better if you want peace of mind. The house is located in the middle of greenery  in the middle of the island  convenient to both the city and the different beaches. Christina is also a wonderful and attentive host. She greeted us with her mother's jams (very good kumquat)  and upon departure with goodbye gifts. Once for our fingerprints  we were out of the house  with the keys inside  and she came promptly to help us. The family's ponies are close by  and Lucy  the kitten with two still pounding little ones  were guests in the garden. Very nice garden to stay at night  Autan-Muniti naturally Translated from Italian  Show original
24752604,Andrés June 2022 If you like peace and rural ambiance  this is the place to be. Beautiful house (no luxury but beautiful)  nice big garden with several shade places (very important). We highly recommend Maria's house. Christina is very nice  very attentive and always helpful. A rental car is necessary.

24752604,Di September 2021 Christina's house is simply an idyllic and loving place to relax and unwind. Eye-catcher is the very nicely designed terrace. Communication was impeccable and she is always available. If you have any questions or problems  please do not hesitate to contact us. I highly recommend this place. In no apartment before  we felt so well taken care of as there. The location is also great   you can reach the beach and great beaches in a short time  but a car is necessary. However  in a car on Corfu always favorable if you want to discover a lot. We would come back anytime ❤️ Translated from German  Show original Response from Christina - Maria September 2021 Thank you so much Konstantina for your kind words.

24752604,Nikolaos June 2021 The house is well located  10 min to the city and 10 min to the two best beaches on the island (Kontogialos and Glyfada Beach). The most important thing for us was that it is quiet and no car traffic can be heard. All rooms have air conditioning  which is very pleasant in a heatwave. Good mattresses. Everything needed for preparing food is available. Parking on the premises (rental car an advantage). Free Wi-Fi.

24752604,Laurent August 2020 Christina's House was the perfect place for our stay in Corfu. Located in the center of the Island  it has a very good location if you want to discover the North Island to the south. 1 hour drive to Sidari (the farthest town to the north) and 1 hour to Kavos (the farthest town to the south). The city center was a 15-minute drive. Christina is a responsive and very attentive host. She greeted us with glasses of fresh water and was able to answer any questions we had. To end the house has everything! Spacious garden  free parking  2 bedrooms  a large living room and kitchen sufficiently equipped to manage. There were 4 of us  everything went very well.

657984696448150466,Alx August 2022 Family-owned business  where we felt just like home. Dimitrios was so kind to allow us to check-in earlier than the specified hour. He welcomed us with lots of good stuff  on the house and also took his time to present the area and answer any questions we had. Very nice apartment  with all the facilities we needed as a family with a toddler. Clean  spacious and nicely designed. You also have a garden with lots of shade at your disposal. The place is quiet and you are not disturbed by anyone. All doors and windows have mosquitos nets  so you are pretty protected from them. Parking is right next to the door  which helped getting our luggage in and out. Dimitrios was always easy to reach and quick to help when needed. You can see that he is such a good person!  All in all  we had a very pleasant stay  so I totally recommend the place!
657984696448150466,Sophie September 2022 Dimitrios is a great host who provided us with numerous tips on Corfu and Paxos. The location in the middle of Corfu was perfect for us to get to know the island. Translated from German  Show original
657984696448150466,Flora September 2022 We stayed in Mr. Demetri's house for 7 days and it was all lovely. The photos are fully representative and the house was equipped with everything  there is also a small pharmacy and the times we chose to cook we found everything we needed in the kitchen. There is comfortable parking space right outside the house. The location was exactly what we wanted  not in the center of the city but just 15 minutes  with supermarkets  pharmacies and bakeries nearby. And in the right spot for exploring both the north and south of the island. Finally  Mr. Demetri was extremely helpful and kind  always available in anything we needed. A very nice move is that she had left us drinks and breakfast for our next day as we arrived late at night. So if we go to Κέρκυρα again we know where we're staying. Translated from Greek  Show original
657984696448150466,Daniel August 2022 It was absolutely fantastic to stay in the house of Dimitrios! To start with  Dimitrios was super nice  respectful and helpful. He clearly let us know from the start that he could help us with anything during our stay if we wanted to. We were very interested in the local cuisine  nature and the beach ourselves. Together with Dimitrios we made a plan to experience all this  and it was beautiful! We went to beaches and ate at restaurants where only locals came  which I could never have found myself. When we arrived the fridge was stocked with all kinds of drinks  from local beer and ginger beer  to fresh fruit (including from our own garden!). The house felt very cozy  with great attention to details in the furniture  the decoration and general decor of the house.  Furthermore  the house itself was even bigger than it looks in the photos  it was perfectly clean and maintained. Furthermore  it was super quiet around the house  with as any sound the sound of nature around the house. We slept great. Air conditioning was great and we had a private parking space for the car.  Finally  the location is also great if you have rented a car. The house is right in the middle of the island  so it is easy to plan days out in all directions  within an hour's drive.  We arrived as a guest and left as friends  so I can definitely recommend this Airbnb listing! Show more Translated from Dutch  Show original
657984696448150466,Marina July 2022 Dimitros welcomed us enthusiastically and gave us a taste of local specialties and helpful information for our stay.

36863757,Sarah November 2022 We had a blissful holiday at Lina's house. The setting is beautiful and tranquil. The house is well appointed and the hosts provided additional items to assist with our baby such as cot  high chair  and baby bath. they also kindly supplied some provisions of food and drink so we could settle in nicely before needing any groceries. Konstantina was very easy to communicate with and extremely kind in assisting with arrangements for a special occasion we were celebrating. The kids adored befriending the neighbourhood cats and we all are two splendid meals at the nearby romantic taverna. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay  as it's beautiful setting and a great base for exploring Corfu. Thanks and we hope to return.
36863757,Missy Siobhan October 2022 Superb stay. Lovely and welcoming people in the village. Beautiful view from the terrace.
36863757,Andy October 2022 The house is as described and shown in the listing. Like other guests we received the quality extras that top hosts provide; in our case the arrangement for the Romatic Taverna to stay open for us after our delayed flight. The 'Romantic' adds an extra level of value here: under 100m away  and Michaelis  an English speaking professional cook who uses produce from his own farm/garden and does not use a deep fat fryer. A big bonus is that the terraces allow one to sit in the sun all day  great for October. There is good dhade on the main terraces for mid-summer. Very quiet  rural and authentic. Bliss  really.
36863757,Yvonne September 2022 Lovely house in a peaceful  rural area. Would definitely recommend.
36863757,Veronica September 2022 Very nice romantic and bohemian place with excellent view from all 3 relaxing terraces - spacious rooms & nice and good quality appliances  very well equipped for various needs starting from the kitchen to bathroom and others - some examples: aluminum foil for wrapping - Oau!!!  iron for the clots  umbrella for the beach  first aid kit  and stuff for babies. Konstantina surprised us with a full fridge to have breakfast for more then one day  wine and plenty of still water - so excellent host!! As for the surroundings - we recommend a smaller car as it was a bit difficult for us to go around the island with a large and pretty low car - there are hills all-around . The 2 most beautiful beaches can be accessed only by foot so take some sneakers with you cose I broke the sleepers while climbing :D
36863757,Tre September 2022 The location is perfect with lovely mountain views. Parking is available with a taverna within several meters of the house. lots of stuff to keep you going in the fridge which was a great binus since we arrived so late. i would recommend to anyone.
36863757,Natalja August 2022 We had a pleasure of staying in Kato Pavliana. The house was very spacious  clean and modern. Konstantina thoughtfully has filled our fridge with essential items that was greatly appreciated! We have had a very relaxing holiday there and would highly recommend it.
36863757,Michael July 2022 We were so impressed with Lina's house. Really beautiful  spacious and comfortable. We were so grateful to find food and wine on arrival and a plentiful supply of tomatoes and peppers from the garden. The balconies both with lush mountain landscapes and distant view of the sea. We had everything that we needed. Konstantina and her husband were very kind and helpful. We would highly recommend.
36863757,Cami July 2022 Lina s house was so lovey and even better than we imagined. Konstantina was a lovely host and very helpful in giving us also suggestions and directions for our first staying in Corfu. Her house coupled with Romantic Taverna for food and great stories was all we needed for a perfect stay with a family. Even if we had a small kid with us  we felt at ease with everything and easy to get around. I wanna come back as soon as possible :D Response from Κωνσταντίνα July 2022 Cami  Iam so glad that you enjoyed your stay! You are always welcome to visit again. Thank you very much.
36863757,Barbara June 2022 Konstantina and her husband Kostas were very helpful and welcoming and quickly responded to any questions we had. Their house is a very spacious  well equipped  village house set in the mountains with wonderful views. Because of its location a car is essential and we suggest that you hire a small car as access to the village is through narrow  winding roads. It is a very peaceful location but if you want to visit beaches the nearest is about 15 minutes drive from the house.
36863757,"Monika April 2022 Lina's House is a super-cosy and nice villa. It's beautifully and authentically furnished  very clean and you can find there anything you need. Even if you are missing something  Konstantina & her husband hurry to solve the problem :) They also welcomed us with some pre-bought groceries  which was a relieve after a long journey! Not to mention their own olive oil and vinegar :) We've enjoyed a lot 3 different balconies  facing West & East  all with beautiful views. The Romantic Taverna  which is literally 50 meters away is another story - we were having our dinners there every single night :D (check google reviews and you'll find out why it's so nice)  Of course  you need to have a car  cause it's quite ""in the middle of nowhere"". Also  even though within 10 mins drive you can find more restaurants & grocery stores  there's no restaurant for breakfast or lunch in walking distance (Romantic Taverna opens at 5pm).  We'd love to come back there if we're once again in Corfu!"
36863757,Jessica April 2022 beautiful view and friendly people (tip: you should rent a car tot explore the island!)

36863757,Alex August 2021 We spend 14 days in Konstantina’s house et we were delighted. The house is situated in a small and quiet village  with a nice taverna a few meters away! It is well equiped - particularly for childcare equipment - and really clean. We really appreciated the few provisions in the fridge on our arrival! Konstantina was attentive and helpful  by giving some advices when we needed! We recommand this House renting and its host! Response from Κωνσταντίνα September 2021 Thank you for your suggestion to tell you the truth i haven't thought about it but now I'll add it !!! Wish you all the best!!
36863757,Bernd August 2021 We  a family of four  spent 4 nights in Lina's house and we can only highly recommend this to everybody. The house is fantastic (spacious  nicely decorated  with three terraces ...)  the fridge was filled when we arrived with all you need  the Taverne Romantic next door is great  it is quiet  away from the touristic main streams  there are lots of things to discover in a circle of 30min by car...and the host is very friendly as well. Very  very nice!!
36863757,Thomas August 2021 Corfu is a wonderful place to visit  and Konstantina's house is the perfect place to stay ! Very nice house in the charming village of Kato Pavliana
36863757,Luca July 2021 We spend two weeks in the house and it was so lovely! very nice place to stay in the middle of green 😍 we had the friendliest host  she brought sweets and veggies and was so kind and i could contact her any time. definitely would stay there again. thanks for everything!
36863757,Agnieszka June 2021 We spent a really lovely time in Konstantina's house. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. However  local restaurant is 2 minutes walk away  beach 10 minutes by car. The house itself was very clean  spacious and exceptionally well equipped (for example covid tool kits). What is more  we were pleasantly surprised by the food  wine and self-made olive oil left for us. We highly recommend this house and Konstantina as a host. Thank you for having us!
36863757,Julia June 2021 we had a very nice time at konstantina's place! it is in a very small village with nice views of the surrounding hills. there's a fabulous taverna down the road but not anything else in the town. beautiful beaches are 10-30 minutes away. you are really in the countryside-- there are roosters next door that are quite loud so you may need to bring earplugs! the mattresses were sagging a bit and maybe needed to be replaced. konstantina was very nice and checked in with us and left us beach umbrellas when we asked. overall a good value especially if you are staying with a group. Response from Κωνσταντίνα June 2021 Hi Julia  I'm sorry you didn't find the mattresses comfortable  but actually the truth is that we renovated the House 1 and a half year ago  so we bought a lot of new things  including the mattresses. Thank you for your recommendations  I will seriously consider them. Wish you and Derek all the best ! Show more
36863757,Marta August 2020 Our time at Lina's house was fantastic. The location is perfect and we felt very welcome. Constatina was a great host and she provided us with lots of essentials and nice little touches. Highly recommended house to stay in the beautiful island of Corfu.
36863757,Vivien August 2020 Me and my friends had a wonderful week at this lovely house. It is located in a calm and cute little village. The house has everything that you need and is perfect for a bigger group or family. The interior is rustic and comfortable. Everything was all over perfect.
36863757,Andreas August 2020 What a beautiful and cosy house. We felt very comfortable in this lovely accomodation  we found everything we needed to spend a relaxing holiday. The very warmy welcome of Konstantina and family let us feel very happy right from the beginning. There is so much space inside the house with its three sleeping rooms and the fully equipped kitchen so we didn't miss anything. And the prepared fridge with something to eat and drink when we arrived was an impressing detail for us and made us feeling very well right from the start. Thank you  Konstantina  for all your friendly and helping support and your offer to call you anytime if there are any questions or other things to speak about. All the best for you and hope to see you soon. Greets from Berlin  Germany  Andreas
36863757,Héau August 2020 Wonderfull place out of crowd. Typical local way of life.
36863757,Dina July 2020 Such a stunning house to spend a relaxing holiday   we loved everything in this house   super clean &tidy. konstantina the host she offered us perfect hospitality . offered us food   coffee   local wine . The house is fully furnished and equipped . Is middle of the nature and at the same time is near to many beautiful beaches by car. Next door there is a local taverna where you can find delicious Greek food. Beautiful house & beautiful people in Corfu island ❤️
36863757,Lucien October 2019 Perfect stay   Konstantina was very aware with our needs. We had some troubles at the airport and we were 2 hours late  Konstantina waited for us. Otherwise  she helped us during the stay to find local tourism informations  places and restaurants to visit  ... A small thing that could be improved: to add a dishwasher.
36863757,Adriana October 2019 Thanks a lot for your hospitality  we really enjoyed our stay in Corfú. The house is beautiful  very clean   wel equipated kitchen  comfortable beds and plenty of clean towels. The views are stunning  quiet village. We will come back :)
36863757,Roy September 2019 I wanted to say thank you to our wonderful hosts. It was very pleasant to stay in your home. The house is very special and with an amazing view. I really loved the quiet and peaceful village and the neighbors who were always kind and welcoming. I think for us it was an experience of experiencing the real Corfu. Thank you again.
36863757,Isobel September 2019 What a beautiful place to stay!! Amazing views and amazing hospitality! Konstantina met us at the airport and organised a hire car for us. There was food in the fridge  so are arrival was made very smooth. Konstantina suggested beaches for us to go to and checked during the week if we needed anything. You will definitely need a car to get around to the local beaches but the village was really pretty and a very a peaceful place to stay. Would definitely return!! 5 stars!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
36863757,Ioana August 2019 One of the most important things in a holiday  is the accommodation. In our case  Lina's house was the best choice to find. The house is a piece of history that through the hands of the owners became a piece of art. The surroundings of the house with fig trees  grapes  olive trees  cactuses  lemon trees and flowers both wild and domestic  creates an environment filed with peace and beauty. The terraces give you a beautiful perspective of the mountains. The house is fully equipped  with everything you need for a pleasant stay. The owners were absolutely amazing from the time of our arrival until we left. All their support and hospitality made our stay an unforgettable experience.
36863757,Daniel August 2019 I should start with the owners hospitality which was amazing. They gave us great tips about where to go  communicated very well  quick to response. The place was beautiful  nicely decorated  very clean  with everything you needed being there. The place wasn`t hard to find and is located in a small quiet village with the nearest beach at 5-10 mins by car(very beautiful beach with many bars and places to eat). A car is recommended to have or to rent scooters/atvs. The views over the mountains and the terrace was particularly beautiful. We enjoyed our stay there and the host. We HIGHLY recommend this place ! We hope to return in the near future. If you come in Corfu and want to visit as much as possible and enjoy the beach  this is the perfect place to stay ! Response from Κωνσταντίνα August 2019 Dear Daniel thank you and your family for your kind words you are always most welcome any time you want. Best wishes to you all Konstantina Show more
36863757,Rita September 2022 We enjoyed the stay in Lina's house very much. It was clean and everything necessary was available. Groceries were available for the beginning and we were warmly welcomed. The terraces in particular are a real highlight. Highly recommended is a visit to Michael's tavern where you can eat very well. We felt very comfortable and recommend the house. Many thanks to Konstantina and Kostas for their hospitality. Translated from German  Show original

36863757,"Cindhy July 2022 We had a wonderful family holiday at Lina's house. It's a very peaceful place  ideally located because it's right in the center of the island 🏝 We really enjoyed the few provisions in the fridge when we arrived! Here you can relax and enjoy the tranquility and views of Corfu countryside. 50 meters from the property is ""Romantica Taverna"" What a fabulous place with Michael and Anna. Traditional Corfu cuisine in a taverna that attracts locals and tourists alike. Thank you Konstantina for a great stay! Translated from French  Show original"
36863757,Jennifer June 2022 Beautiful place  amazing host and ideally located because in the heart of the island!!! We stayed here for 2 weeks with our 2 small children and we highly recommend it!!! 🤍 Translated from French  Show original
36863757,Laura May 2022 We had a very nice stay at the property. Everything was very clean and tidy and the fridge was already filled with many things  so we were taken care of at home despite arriving on Sunday. Konstantina and her husband were super nice hosts and quickly accessible for questions at any time. The location of the accommodation was quieter and the village smaller than we expected – but this was not a minus point for us  as you could enjoy the quiet nature and the village was not touristy. However  you should definitely get a rental car to easily reach everything. All in all we were very satisfied and would come back any time! :) Translated from German  Show original Response from Κωνσταντίνα May 2022 Thank you! We are very happy that you felt comfortable and enjoyed your vacation! You are always welcome. Translated  Show original
36863757,Jeanne May 2022 Very good stay at Konstantina's. Lina's house is a little piece of paradise  the house is comfortable and has all the equipment you need for your stay. In love with cats  you will find your happiness with all the little cats who keep the place. Located very close to a taverna offering excellent specialties and local produce.  Be careful not to be afraid of the rooster shouting at 5am! Translated from French  Show original
36863757,Emma May 2022 The stay at Lina's House was very pleasant. The house and furnishings are well maintained  cozy and it has everything you need! Especially the three terraces are unbeatable  you have shade/sun at any time of the day. The rooms are also very spacious! Communication with Konstantina was straightforward and great. Highly recommended (as mentioned in the reviews before) the tavern of Michael is a few houses away. However  the village in which the house stands is very small - which on the one hand leads to pleasant peace and lots of nature  but on the other hand everything (such as shopping) is definitely only accessible by car. Overall  however  we felt very comfortable and thank you Konstantina for a great stay! Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Katja April 2022 We were very satisfied with the accommodation. Konstantina is a super host who is always approachable. The fridge was already filled  the house very clean and very lovingly furnished. We really enjoyed the time there. Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Rosanna October 2021 The apartment is great  it has everything you need and a great quiet location. It is very large and comfortably furnished. In addition  it has two large balconies where you can enjoy the beautiful view of the mountains. Konstantina is a very warm host and she makes every effort to make you feel comfortable during your stay. She is reachable anytime and even felt the fridge with a few little things  so we were first taken care of. We would definitely recommend the apartment and would love to come back. Truly an absolute insider tip for an authentic Corfu holiday. Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Jacob October 2021 Konstantina welcomed us very warmly and already provided us with a full fridge with all kinds of things for our arrival. A very spacious  cozy apartment in the mountains. Here you can unwind and enjoy the tranquility and views of the Corfu countryside. Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Andrea September 2021 We stayed in Lina's house for the second time and felt very comfortable again. It is so nicely quiet and very cozy. We highly recommend the restaurant a bit further down the street. Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Alain September 2021 House on the edge of a small  very uncrowded road. Great kitchen. More cats than locals in the immediate area. Very quiet but like us  you have to like the roosters singing. Car essential. Very good Taverna 2 min walk. Open only in the evening. Very nice beach about 15-20 minutes by car Translated from French  Show original
36863757,Annemarie July 2021 We loved our stay at Lina's house. The house is very spacious  beautifully renovated with an eye for detail and very cozy. It is equipped with all facilities and sparkling clean. The beds are excellent. We spent a lot of time on the terraces at the front  the view over the area is really magnificent. There is a third (somewhat smaller) terrace at the rear of the house  so you can sit in the sun or the shade at any time of the day as you wish. Kostas and Konstantina are particularly welcoming and helpful. The small attentions such as the homemade olive oil  the delicious cake  the beach umbrellas etc were very much appreciated by us. Absolutely recommended is the local tavern  a 2-minute walk away. Excellent food and particularly friendly owners. The surrounding area is beautiful  good for great walks. To the beach is only a 15-minute drive. If we visit Corfu again  we will be happy to return to Lina's house! Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Κωνσταντίνα July 2021 Thank you for your kind words! You are always welcome back to Lina's House and we will be delighted to have you :) . As for the key incident  don't worry about it  it could happen to anyone  as it happend to me a few months back when i locked myself out of my car!! I wish you all the best! Konstantina Show more
36863757,Andrea October 2020 We had a wonderful holiday in Lina's house. It is very nicely renovated and furnished and quietly located. We were very warmly welcomed by Kostantina's family. In the fridge were groceries for our first day of holiday. We felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
36863757,Lotta September 2020 The cottage has fully met our expectations. The location in the mountains in a small village is very nice. Konstantina and her husband welcomed us late at night although we were there much later than agreed. They left groceries for the first day in the fridge for us. Even a bottle of wine and a beer for everyone. In the house there was everything you needed plus a few details that make your stay pleasant. The house was sparkling clean. The three bedrooms are spacious and the beds good. The bathroom is very nicely renovated and spacious. The kitchen-living room is the main room if the weather is not so good and you do not want to sit on one of the terraces. 20 m down the road is a very good restaurant. Shopping is two villages away. Overall  it was a very successful vacation. Show more Translated from German  Show original

593386703051954239,Sharifah November 2022 Tim and Yannis are great hosts  I would always get a swift response and they always would help me find a solution to any issue I had. What you see is what you get and it's definitely worth the stay if you want to be more away from the city. This would be best if you had a car rental  which we didn't have but they both helped me to find a taxi service to get us around. The views are stunning and the villa has everything you need. Response from Tim November 2022 Thank you for your kind words Sharifah  always welcome. Glad you enjoyed your stay
593386703051954239,Zoe November 2022 The pictures of this Airbnb home online really do not do the place any justice - it is absolutely fabulous with breathtaking views. The interior was spotless  beautifully presented with clear instructions and the location was fantastic; just out the way but close enough to not feel isolated. It was also lovely to have a little welcome gift  a nice special touch. Our only niggles were a lack of toilet roll (2 rolls to last 3 people 6 days!)  inadequate cooking equipment and no communication following a power cut (but otherwise communication was very fast). Going during off-peak season meant most things were closed but it allowed us to see a more authentic Corfu. Our main recommendation if you do stay here is to try the taverna just down the road - the food was mouth watering! Overall we'd definitely come back :)
593386703051954239,Jack October 2022 We had a wonderful week in this villa. It is better than it looked in the pictures. The space and layout were fantastic. Everything was clean and immaculately maintained. The location is great and very peaceful. We wish we could stay longer and i think we will definitely have holiday blues when we get home.
593386703051954239,Alastair October 2022 The villa was fantastic: a modern  open plan interior with an incredible view and everything you could need. The host was really helpful  friendly  and quick to respond. It’s close enough to stuff to do  but far enough away that it’s quiet. I would advise getting a car.
593386703051954239,Sophia October 2022 The house is even more beautiful than in the pictures. The view is great and there's a Taverna nearby which serves great food. The kitchen is well equipped and the house has a lot of amenities (Hairdryer  Steamer  Slippers  Speakers ...). The nearest supermarket is 15min on foot  for everything else a rental car is of advantage. We truly enjoyed our holiday and would definitely recommend staying here.
593386703051954239,Ashley October 2022 Tim’s place is amazing and conveniently located near multiple restaurants and shops. A must stay. Tim supplied us with some essentials and gifts for our first night and was helpful through out the stay. We couldn’t ask for a better host and come on - Just the views from that infinity pool make it worth it!
593386703051954239,Vishal September 2022 A genuinely beautiful place made even better with an easy check-in process  great communication and all the little touches on arrival from Tim and Yannis.

39010216,Faig October 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at Jutta’s place. It was small and cozy studio but i had the basics we needed. Location was also good  about 15 minutes to Corfu town. Also host was very helpful and gave us valuable tips about island.
39010216,Helena September 2022 The apartment was really nice and the ubication was perfect. But the apartment was too tiny. It has everything you should need but its really complicated to cook or wash your clothes/dishes. In order to clean dishes for example you need to go outside and do it in the garden because there is no space inside. Anyway  Jutta is very close and careful. Her dog and cat made our trip <3
39010216,Anuschka August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at Jutta’s studio. Although she was not on the island during our stay  communication was very good and she helped us out several times when we had questions. The studio is small  but it has the basics for a nice stay. However  we decided not to cook meals as that would take some improvising with the small space. Instead we had dinner in the village of Agios Ioannis or in Corfu town. There is a nice space to sit outside  but there are many mosquitoes so make sure to bring some repellent. Furthermore  the location is good and close to the bus station. We rented a scooter during our stay  but public transport on the island is doable as well  especially towards Corfu town. We’d definitely recommend the studio!
39010216,Katja July 2022 We had a really pleasant stay with Jutta. The studio had everything we needed for our stay and the host helped us with anything else  she even offered to give us a ride to our flight  which was early in the morning. Near the studio was the village centre with a taverna with delicious authentic food. Bus station to the city is a 10 minute walk. Response from Jutta July 2022 Hi Katja  Thank you for the positive criticism. I had texted you on your day of departure  but maybe you don't use your Greek sim card in Bulgaria at all. Never mind  I forgot something: I have to report all rentals to the tax office and for that I need the number of the ID or the passport of the person who booked  so from you  Katja. Can you send me the number please! Greetings Jutta Show more Translated  Show original
39010216,Natalie April 2022 This cozy studio was a perfect base for my two months on Corfu!  It's central location on the island makes it about a 15 minute drive to Corfu town to the east  and a 20 minute drive to Glyfada beach to the west.  Jutta is a great host  and all around a lovely person. She was helpful and always quick to respond. The terrace was a great place to work and the surrounding village with it's local taverna and friendly people as well as the beautiful nature made you feel like you were back living on the farm. You'll hear the Scops Owls and see giant toads almost every night. And Jutta's dog and cat were a joy as well. :)  The kitchen is minimal  so just be prepared to get creative with your one-pot meals and washing your dishes outside.  I would definitely recommend Jutta's place and I would certainly stay here again if I ever return  especially if you're looking for the calmer side of Corfu. Thanks again  Jutta. Show more
39010216,Giuseppe November 2021 Ok
39010216,Jonas August 2021 Very Cozy place to stay. Nice furniture and bathroom. You can cook food and there is a table to dinner outside surrounded by green trees. Everything you need is there. House is in the end of old village. One part of the house is for the guests. Perfect sound isolation. We came by a scooter so it was easy to find  coordinates of the place are correct in the airbnb map. Few kilometers from Corfu and 400 meters from the main road.
39010216,Gunita July 2021 It’s was very nice staying at Jutta apartment. She is nice and charismatic person. The place is quiet  simple but very atmospheric :) We stay three persons- couple with a baby and it was perfect for everyone! Location is good if you have a car :)

39010216,Julija August 2020 We spent 2 months in this place. And it was great time. The apartment is not big  but very cozy and comfortable. You have everything you need to live there. Small kitchen  fully equipped bathroom  very nice private terrace to sit outside  great WIFI.  The area around the house is very green and quite. Taverna  take away Pizza  supermarket  coffee shops  pharmacy in the village. Good place to discover the island  because you are directly in the middle of the island.

39010216,Pascal October 2022 Very pleasant stay in small accommodation in the countryside  without being far from Corfu Town. Friendly host and caring for our well-being. Translated from French  Show original
39010216,Daniele September 2022 Jutta made us feel at home  her spotlessly clean and comfortable accommodation is equipped with all the essential comforts small and compact for those like us looking for a place surrounded by nature and central to explore the whole island  as it is perfectly located in the center of it. Jutta was a fantastic host  discreet but at the same time present in anything  she made herself available for everything  giving us advice and tips to visit some places  from where to eat  to the smallest of needs. thank you so much for the wonderful welcome and everything! 100% recommended!!! Monica & Daniele Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Jutta October 2022 Thanks for the kind words! Thanks a lot for your nice words! Translated  Show original
39010216,Antonis September 2022 Great communication with the host. Ambient ideal in the midst of nature close to the city  and at a hub. The house is simple yet functional. Value for money. Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Marine August 2022 Perfect stay  Jutta is attentive  of endless kindness I recommend!! Translated from French  Show original Response from Jutta September 2022 Thank you very much! Translated  Show original
39010216,Giulio August 2022 We stayed in Jutta's small studio surrounded by nature and the small town of Agios Ioannis 20 min from Kerkira. Jutta wasn't there  but she left us the keys hanging (to show you how quiet it is)  allowing us to arrive whenever they wanted  and she made herself available for the next few days. The studio is a small dependence on your house  there is a small plate and the sink is the one in the bathroom. We only had breakfast in the outdoor space with her red cat who always came to take her pampering. In short  a simple but functional studio to enjoy relaxation. Translated from Italian  Show original
39010216,Giannis August 2022 hospitality  clean and nice house Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Anna July 2022 Jutta is an incredibly friendly and helpful host. Check in was personal  she even gave us excursion tips and made the connection to a scooter rental. The accommodation itself is small but clean and very lovingly furnished  a kitchenette and kitchen utensils are available. I especially liked the mosquito repellent. We felt very comfortable there and thank the hostess very much! Translated from German  Show original
39010216,Cécile July 2022 Great stay at Jutta's  perfect for a romantic getaway  I recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
39010216,Cristiana July 2022 Jutta and her dog greeted us warmly and on time. The directions in advance were very helpful. Communication was also straightforward. Unfortunately  we were only there for a few days. We would definitely book the place again. Translated from German  Show original
39010216,Μαρία July 2022 The room for his money was fine! Affordable cool with A/C and in a quiet place. Thanks so much! The host was kind and everything we needed was there! Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Βασιλικη July 2022 Jutta excellent host warm delight and communication.. The room very cozy and good..Clean and equipped..It is also very convenient for the center of Cyprus!! It was all very nice!!! Thank you so much for hosting!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Hilde October 2021 At Jutta you will find a small idyllic apartment that gives you everything you need. The hostess is very helpful and hospitable. Since she speaks and writes Greek perfectly  she is a pearl for guests who want to learn about life in Corfu. I felt very comfortable! Translated from German  Show original
39010216,Βασιλική September 2021 We had a wonderful stay! Ms. Jutta is a kind lady who is eager to help and assist you in any way! The room was nice for his money  in a quiet place not far from city center (15' by car). The only thing that would help would be a better view of the photos  otherwise it shows that the cottage is different. A little dusty is in the room  as it has a lot and all the time! Even so  everything was great! A little bunny to rest in. Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Kiki August 2021 Jutta is welcoming and helpful   the price of accommodation is attractive . Just because the surrounding area is green you have some mosquito protection with you The property is located in a really hub location near the city and in the center of the island. Translated from Greek  Show original
39010216,Marilyne August 2021 We had a pleasant stay at Jutta's. She is very welcoming. The studio is very clean and comfortable. It is necessary to have a vehicle to travel because it is quite isolated. A more than reasonable price. Thanks Jutta Translated from French  Show original
39010216,Ria August 2021 Jutta was a very friendly  easy going and uncomplicated host. Not only did her small studio provide everything we needed for our stay  Jutta always asked about our well-being  so we felt well taken care of. Value for money was just as fantastic as the idyllic location  which seemed little touristy  but which also offered a quick connection to Corfu city. All in all  a nice holiday in Corfu  10/10 we would come back:) Translated from German  Show original
39010216,Zorzito July 2021 A nice stay especially for those who have a motorcycle and not only that are in the center of the island almost   so they can be moved to various points of interest. It is possible to move from this spot to both the east and west of the island with a few kilometers. The host is very kind and welcoming. Translated from Greek  Show original Response from Jutta July 2021 Thanks for the kind words  I hope we don't get lost! Translated  Show original
39010216,Blandine July 2021 Jutta is a fabulous host: kindness  availability and discretion. The room has a double bed  air conditioning and a mosquito net that will be precious allies in summer. Unbeatable value for money. Excellent location  very quiet and green. I would recommend it without so much as a second thought. Translated from French  Show original
39010216,Camille July 2021 A charming studio close to a family inn where we eat well and where the kids can play safely. Recommended ! Translated from French  Show original
39010216,Dimitra June 2021 Very nice little house in nature with a nice balcony and the hosts very kind and helpful!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
34251918,Romy September 2022 The apartment was as shown in the pictures and very clean! If you do not have a car  you should have fun running up and down mountains :D we felt super comfortable and would come back any time!
34251918,Lorenc August 2022 Great house and even greater people. The most amazing experience which I will definitely repeat on the years to come
34251918,Richard August 2022 We loved it here! Great apartment  especially the balcony with amazing views. It was slightly tricky to find initially  but  with a hire car  was the perfect place to explore the north of the island! We’d definitely go back!
34251918,Vincent July 2022 Well equpped with all a couple or family needs. Wonderful balcony views. Some good local tavernas and mini markets within walking distance. Other wise you do need a car ro stay here. Highly recommended.
34251918,Edward June 2022 We visited Corfu as two couples and split the cost of the apartment between us. We found that the apartment had everything we needed. The only downside is the apartment has one one bathroom and toilet  but this was fairly easy to work around. It is strongly recommended thatyou hire a car if you choose to rent here  or just to get around Corfu in general. Driving around is fairly easy  although I would suggest applying a cautious approach and let the locals overtake I'd they want to. There are a fee local supermarkets about minutes away  as well as a Lidl. Corfu Town is 15 minutes drive and there are plenty of parking spaces at the Old Port / BP Garage. In short  this apartment is great value and a good base to have to explore the rest of the island.
34251918,Caitin June 2022 This was a beautiful air bnb  excellent location and very helpful hosts. We had the best week here for our holiday. The view was gorgeous the furniture and decor was lovely! We had the flat to ourselves and really enjoyed being so close to Corfu Town and various other Great locations  yet being secluded in the hills. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone!
34251918,Evgenii October 2021 Wonderful place: fully equipped kitchen  huge terrace with a view  comfortable beds. Honestly  there is nothing to complain about.
34251918,Larysa October 2021 Excellent appartment.
34251918,Qiu Ginj October 2021 Wonderful and beautiful place! We really enjoyed the stay! All the amenities were great  including wifi  water heating etc. Very responsive Windy roads to get to place so be prepared but worth it!
34251918,Viktoriia September 2021 Very cozy well-equipped apartment with the beautiful view
34251918,Alicia September 2021 The apartment is great for a groups and families. the view from the Terrasse is stunning and the apartment has a great location  it is super quite but local restaurants and Corfu town as well as great beaches are very close by! You will find everything in the apartment from shampoo  towels to cooking equipment! Also the hosts are great  we needed not necessarily a lighter in the evening at around 9pm and Artemis still answered me and 15mim later we got a lighter and nectarines as a treat! So lovely  I can just highly recommend this place 😊
34251918,Sarah August 2021 Great welcome to corfu  met by a lovely young man who led us to the apartment. Amazing apartment  very well equipped and spotlessly clean  with a very pretty garden to take advantage of.  Quiet location with a sea view  you can sit and watch the sun rise and set  it is just beautiful.  I recommend a car to get around the island  you will be able to visit all the small little villages and beaches  we found many on our travels. Great local tavernas  the food is very good value  and you will be fed well!  Sunshine  friendly people and great food  Happy Holidays!
34251918,Michal June 2021 Very good accommodation with complete facilities. We did not encounter a single problem during our stay. We arrived on a Sunday so we were glad for the donated bottled water. Thanks to daddy for his care.
34251918,Ana-Elena June 2021 What an amazing place! If we could  we wouldn't have left. The apartment is big  clean  fully equipped even for long stays. The wifi connection was good enough to allow us to work remotely. The host was really nice and helped us whenever we had an issue. But I think the highlight of this apartment is the huge balcony and the amazing view that it offers. Just keep in mind that you will need a car in order to get to this place. Corfu town is only a 15-20 minutes drive away so it was not an issue for us. All in all we had an amazing experience and we highly recommend this place.
34251918,George June 2021 We stayed for seven nights it was only 2 of us we had plenty space to room around huge balcony and very satisfying  leaving room was excellent with beautiful dining table over seeing the open view of the balcony  The driving to downtown was only 15 minutes every penny was worth staying at Maria’s  Nikos greeted us and delivered our heavy luggage’s to our apartment  he was superb!!! One of the best part was the private electric remote gate and the car port with private drive way  all together it was fantastic !!! We felt like at our own home and slept well !!!
34251918,Jennifer September 2020 We had a lovely stay at the apartment. Very clean and stylist. Feels like being out in the country but very central for seeing the entire island if you have a car. Loved our time there and would love to come back.
34251918,Laura September 2020 Hi there  if you chose this apartment for your stay on Corfu  you've done well! It is an lovely and spacious apartment  with a big balcony! It's very clean and you have everything to feel comfortable  as well as for cooking or grilling (including essential spices and oil)  so go on and enjoy a lovely stay at this apartment :). From the balcony you have a nice sea view and you're not too far from Corfu city  but please remember you need a car to really enjoy the best bits on the island  and please ask Maria for the exact google coordinates of the flat  otherwise  you end up searching the place for a long time... Have a good time! Best wishes  Laura
34251918,Dmitry September 2020 Marias apartment has an absolutely astonishing view. Also the whole furniture is so stylish and beautiful. We loved our stay there. Its just the perfect place to relax.
34251918,Anna August 2020 We stayed at Maria's apartment for a week in August. The apartment is spacious and clean  beds are very comfortable  all windows have mosquito nets. We really liked the large terrace with wonderful views and how neatly the house is kept. The apartment is situated on top of the hill about 5 minutes drive from town. We had a car so it was a good base for us to explore the island.
34251918,Afroditi July 2020 A very cozy and clean apartment at the 2nd floor of a villa with a perfect view from mountain hills to the sea and the city castle!!!The location is ideal for someone who wants to explore the island from North to South but also be within 10’drive to the old town Center!!! The house is fully equipped and Maria answers rapidly all your requests!!!We would pick the same place next time hopefully...
34251918,Alberto July 2020 The apartment was good as it is in the photos. Maria was always used to answer to my questions and messages in less then 10 minutes. The area is not close to the center but if you have a motorbike or a car it is absolutely not a problem. The only negative point is the toilet drain  not very powerful. The spaces are really comfortable  the kitchen above all is very equipped!
34251918,Ted September 2019 Wonderful apartment! Very clean and well presented. Great contact from the hosts and they were flexible with my check in/out times. Huge space  perfect for a family or couple. Private terrace without any overlooking neighbors. Own driveway and entrance. Very quiet and peaceful area. You will need a car if you are renting this villa or a lot of taxi rides. Air-conditioning was a lifesaver and rest of the appliances were top spec. Thank you very much
34251918,Sara August 2019 Maria's apartment is amazing place to spend holidays. The loft is spacious  clean  quiet at night  airconditioned  modern and fresh! It looked even better in real life than in the photos especially terrace with a beautiful view. Maria was very nice and helpful. This place is highly recommended!
34251918,Aysin August 2019 Maria is a nice host. The house was very clean and nicely decorated.
34251918,MIrka July 2019 Mary was a great host and in everything she was happy to give advice and help. He has a beautiful apartment  just like the pictures. We spent a nice holiday. I highly recommend.
34251918,Aurélie September 2022 The stay at Artémis was fabulous. We were 3 friends on vacation for a week. The apartment was very clean  comfortable  well appointed and fully equipped. We took full advantage of the outdoor terrace offering a magnificent view of Corfu and its surroundings. It was also possible for us to have the garden to cool down if needed. Upon arrival  we were well advised on activities  restaurants and nice beaches not to be missed. We highly recommend this listing and thank Artémis and Artis again for their flexibility  hospitality and kindness. Translated from French  Show original
34251918,Mathilde August 2022 Our stay went very well. The apartment is very well equipped and clean. The terrace is very nice in the evening  the bedrooms are large and the bedding very comfortable. Only small downside for the bathroom that didn't smell very good. I would highly recommend it. Translated from French  Show original
34251918,Laurence May 2022 Apparently very nice  especially the large terrace and with a beautiful view. Very well located for visits. The only downside  the dogs barking in the evening Translated from French  Show original
34251918,Κατερίνα April 2022 Excellent! Translated from Greek  Show original
34251918,Katharina April 2022 We can fully recommend the place. The pictures are absolutely in line with reality. We particularly liked the large terrace. A quiet  somewhat remote location yet central. However  a car is recommended. You will find everything you need in the accommodation. There are no wishes left. Communication was also very smooth and fast  should you need anything. Translated from German  Show original
34251918,Roberto October 2021 We felt very comfortable in the accommodation. The view from the large terrace of the mountains and the sea was really fantastic. Apart from the sounds of barking dogs and crowing roosters  it was also wonderfully quiet up there. The apartment itself is comfortably furnished. The beds are comfortable and you can sleep in well. If you want to mention any criticisms  the water leaks in the bathroom and it smells a little musty and draining - something that we had already noticed in the first accommodation on Corfu. Wifi was a bit unstable All in all  however  we would like to come back. Translated from German  Show original
34251918,Alex August 2021 The house looks like it's in the photos. It has a very nice view it is tidy and very cozy. Everything was great. Translated from Greek  Show original
34251918,Ioannis August 2021 A unique home for families. Perfectly quiet. Great views! Modern decor with relaxed colors. Fully functional. Parking Garden on its own. Great value!! Translated from Greek  Show original
34251918,Jérémie July 2021 We had a lovely holiday at Artémis' place. Ideally located in the center of the island. In a very quiet area. On the other hand  a car is essential. The accommodation is well equipped  air-conditioned. Large quiet garden and very large terrace without opposite  Artémis and his family are very nice and very welcoming. Translated from French  Show original
34251918,Ειρηνη August 2020 We had a wonderful time! The house is close to the city and the beaches. It's just like the pictures with a big terrace and a great view. It is in a quiet area and ideal for children. Translated from Greek  Show original
34251918,Davide August 2019 We stayed in this apartment for three nights. The Villa is very nice new and well kept. It has a nice private garden  a huge parking space and an automatic gate to access the house. A very quiet place with sea views. Very close to Corfu but very quiet. It has everything you need to enjoy the stay with a nice equipped veranda to enjoy the end of the day and dine outdoors. Maria is easy to communicate with and always responds quickly. She allowed us to stay in the house well past check-out time  which made us very comfortable and enjoyable. I would recommend all of these hosts and this magnificent apartment and this Host. Thanks again  Michela  Martina  Daniele and Davide. Translated from Italian  Show original
34251918,Foteini August 2019 Beautiful  clean and comfortable apartment in a convenient part of the island!!! Hosting was great!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
50087389,Meenzer September 2022 it was awesome
50087389,Patrick August 2022 Two families with teens enjoyed our week stay in Paramonas. The villa is spacious and had everything the families needed for fun and relaxation. The downstairs pool area was a common area for us  with ping pong  swimming and cards on the table. The downstairs refrigerator kept adult and kids drinks cold. The 5 separate bedrooms with their own bathrooms gave everyone the space they wanted in the morning and night. The Paramonas beach was a 3 minute drive down the hill. There we used the chairs and umbrellas to relax when not swimming. The taverna at the beach  Sunset  had great Greek food and service. We also drove to nearby beaches and villages. I recommend Strofi restaurant in Pentati Village. We really enjoyed our week at Villa Paramonas.
50087389,Gabriele July 2022 The location is amazing with an incredible view  and the barbecue area in front of the pool is just stunning. Inside we could sleep very well and the facility has everything you need.  I gave 4 stars because in every detail you can see that the house is not new: the showers  the jacuzzi  the pool and everything else are a bit old and they are starting to age.
33389062,Franka September 2022 Perfect place with many possibilities for excursions and a friendly houseowner. best if you rent a scooter and explore the island..
33389062,Sweet August 2022 Really enjoyed my stay in Corfu and the area around Pelekas was a great place to start to get to know the island for the more independently willing/minded. The accommodation is on a main road where traffic can be quite fast so you need to be careful  especially at night. The bus connection is good (if you don't have your own car or scooter) and Pelekas village friendly with tavernas and a few shops - just get ready to walk up and down hill rather a lot! The walk down and up from the closest beach is pretty steep and winding and there is no longer a shuttle bus. Not for everyone but it is a lovely spot if you don't mind a bit of extra exercise on top of a swim! Theodore was helpful and provided information and guidance over the week and I thought the accommodation and information was accurately presented.
33389062,Abdul Malik August 2022 Its a nice house in the mountains  with a beautiful view. The green surroundings make it very close to nature. You should be aware of insects  especially mosquitos  since there are fruit trees in the garden. Besides that the only way to get around would be the bus or by foot to the close mountaintop city of pelekas. I recommend to rent a scooter for the stay  to be mobile and get around. All in all its a great place to stay.
33389062,Cara August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay. Theoddore and his wife were super hospitable and took us to the beach with them one day. He answered all questions immediately when I texted him and did everything to help us. The room has a beautiful view to the garden and you can even see the sea. Beds and the room in general were very comfortable. We also liked the small town Pelekas. The accommodation is close to the most beautiful beaches of Corfu.
33389062,Andy April 2022 I was in April on Corfu and during that time of the year it is very relaxing and less busy how it might be during summer. Theodores place is beautiful  the views from the room and balcony are simply amazing. Theodore also is a very nice person and helped me with everything. Thank you for the nice week there!
33389062,Joe September 2021 An amazing place to stay on Corfu. The room was clean and comfortable  the kitchen has everything you'd need but the garden/terrace is the best bit - faces directly east  with views towards Corfu town and across to Albania  so you'll wake up with the sunrise. Theodore is a great host  friendly and responsive to any questions and eager to help out.
33389062,Alina August 2021 Everything was good. Theodore has been really nice. If you rent a scooter in Pelekas (20€ a day) you can explore the whole island!
33389062,Sarah August 2021 Had a beautiful stay in Korfu  and Theodore was always available. The house has an incredible view .We recommend renting a scooter  so you can reach all the hidden spots of the island. We can definitely recommend Theodore‘s accomodation.
33389062,Petra August 2021 We had a great time at Theodore’s place. He was very helpful and welcoming  making us feel at home. Place is surrounded by beautiful nature. An authentic Airbnb experience I highly recommend :)
33389062,Elisabetta July 2021 The house is situated in a wonderful position: 15 minute from the city but off the confusion  near some of the most beautiful beaches and spots in the island  in a lovely village  with amazing views and walks. The flat is simple  basic  but has all the facilities needed for an informal holiday. Theodore is such a nice host: always available  smiling and easy going. We spent a very good time there.
33389062,Julie July 2021 We stayed for a week at Theodore's place and we really enjoyed it. Theodore is a great host  very friendly and courteous. The room is tidy and from the balcony you have a great view. In the kitchen you can find everything you need. When we are in Greece next time  we will definitly come back.
33389062,Rehuel September 2020 Theodore's place has great value for money  it's located in a scenic rural area of Corfu. We enjoyed our stay and hiked around the area often. If possible  it's best to rent a vehicle as the public transport is somewhat infrequent. The kitchen was well equipped and his family-made olive oil was amazing!
33389062,Aleksandra August 2020 I highly recommend staying here  everything has exceeded our expectations. The house is located in a very beautiful and quiet area  near the town of Pelekas and the beach. Living there for a week  you can really feel that you are in Greece. Theodore was a great host for us  always helpful.
33389062,Mischa G. March 2020 I went to Corfu in the beginning of March  so at this time it's still rather cold there. But it's perfect to do some walks/hikes from Theodore's place: you can walk parts of the Corfu trail  f.e. connecting some of the beaches by walking along the cliffs (Mirtiotissas  Glifada  Kontogialos  etc.). Another nice thing to do in early spring is to stroll through villages like Kouramadas  Kalafationes  Varipatades. Or you can go to Corfu Town by public bus (no. 11 - only 25minutes) to visit this nice city. Theodore's place is perfect for a nice stay - well equipped kitchen  good working internet  a very nice garden and view  and a nice host who took the time to explain lots of things and hang out!
33389062,Roman October 2019 Theodor is an excellent host with good vibes! We were happy to stay in his cousy- tidy- nature friendly beautiful house! We had an unforgettable time on Corfu! Thank you for everything! Cheers :)
33389062,Robert August 2019 Great location  great host  large apartment with private bedroom and shower with a shared lounge and kitchen
33389062,Maititxu July 2019 The house is very nice  quiet and comfortable  just a few minutes walk from the center of Pelekas  a town with a lot of life  day and night  at least in summer. And Theodore is a gentleman from head to toe. He was there whenever we needed him  without having to ask for it. He is humble  calm  attentive and you can have a good conversation with him. I don't know of any other accommodation in Corfu  but here  no doubt  I would repeat: good location  good reception and better stay. Congratulations Theodore!
33389062,Mattia September 2021 My girlfriend and I had a great time. Theodore offered to pick us up at the airport for a fee! The easiest and cheapest solution! For the room  the cleanliness was excellent! The mattresses are hard  great for me  so better than the bottom mattresses! There is a portable fan (which is very important) so you can move it to our liking! The two rooms have a connecting balcony with a table and two chairs  where you can eat. The kitchen is shared with the other room! Kettle  hot plate  4 burners  an oven  a fridge and a freezer  and various pots! The cleanliness of the kitchen is not possible to give a vote as it is shared with the other room  it is based on the people you meet! Translated from Italian  Show original
33389062,Magalie August 2020 Good value accommodation and very well located in relation to the rest of the island. The village located on the heights is very friendly and lively. Very good welcome from Theodore on arrival. Bathroom is a little old with the shower without a recovery bin (directly on the tiles in the bathroom). Plan anti-mosquito lotions because the garden (very green) houses them at dusk. Kitchen shared with other Airbnb occupants. Translated from French  Show original
33389062,Cristian August 2020 Really picturesque and quiet accommodation  surrounded by nature  to add to this I would mention the cleanliness of the room and the availability and friendliness of the host always ready to answer questions or talk. Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Chris October 2022 5 stars all round for George and his sister Olga. Excellent communication before and during our stay. Apartment exactly as described. Clean and simple and within walking distance of a beach and several tavernas serving tasty dishes including vegan options. Marbella was our favourite. Suggest hiring a car. Thanks for your hospitality George & Olga
11779611,Ghada September 2022 George is super nice  but the place is not super well connected so make sure you have a car.
11779611,Imogen September 2022 We had an amazing time staying at Villa Fourtuna. The apartment is simple but has everything you need. I recommend going to Nikos taverna for dinner and drinks  also I recommend getting a bike or a car to explore the island.
11779611,Kristof August 2022 If you want to have a nice apartment also in a good price range  then this is a good choice. It was clean  had a good view of the sea and from corfu town it was easy to reach with a bus.
11779611,Peter July 2022 George was an excellent host  extremely helpful. The apartment was perfect  in a great location
11779611,Rosie June 2022 We loved our stay and were heartbroken to leave! A slice of paradise. Make sure you hire a car to get around the island but prepare yourself  you are in for a treat!
11779611,Amy June 2022 Beautiful location  stunning views  great host  simple apartment with everything you need. Recommend hiring a car to explore the island  30 min away from the airport  a couple minutes drive to restaurants/shops etc. Shingle/stones beach straight opposite with beach bar  free sun loungers and umbrellas (total 10 beds) so very quiet and private. The sea is so nice  good for snorkelling. I would highly recommend staying here.
11779611,Milea June 2022 Georgiś is an amazing host renting out his beautiful located air bnb. We only have good things to say! Though if you’re a couple  it is to be noticed that the beds can be put together but the bed frames keep the mattresses from touching so there’s a gap in between that makes it hard and unpleasant to lay besides each other… other than that everything was nice and we recommend it!
11779611,Lorenz Alexander June 2022 Clean but very small Appartement right next to the ocean. Everything was fine but be aware  you can barely cook in the kitchen  it’s not very well equipped. The little beach right across the street is beutiful.
11779611,Joseph May 2022 Hello Mr George  I wanted to thank you for your hospitality in your Fortuna apartment  and want to say thank you very much. One thing i have to mention is the bad smell of moist since you do not have a single window for freshening the room or any of the air while rooms are not in use. I suggest much to open a window in front or in the shower at least. In general i would love to say that you are such a great man and hope to see you again🌹🌹🌹many thanks.
11779611,Joe May 2022 Great location and value. Sunrise in the front door.
11779611,Leyla September 2021 The apartment was lovely and George was really friendly. He was really helpful and answered all of our questions. The location is very great with a cute private beach  a mini market and a few tavernas you can reach by foot. Its probably best to rent a car because the road is to dangerous to walk for more than 10 minutes.
11779611,Borbála August 2021 George is a very kind host and his well-located apartment is cute! We recommend them very much! 😊
11779611,Malgorzata August 2021 George is a fantastic host  he offered to pick us up from the airport and gave us amazing advice regarding the area. The house was clean and as described. The view from the apartment was amazing
11779611,Leonie July 2021 Everything was great  the communication was easy and the location is perfect. The beach in front of the house is beautiful and not crowded and its only a 20 minute drive to Corfu Town. We will come back!
11779611,Yasamin July 2021 We had a wonderfull time in this Apartment. The view was amazing .So many beautiful beaches near by. Only 14 km away from Korfu City. The comunication with George was good.
11779611,Sandrina June 2021 George is a great host! Very helpful and nice. About the apartment: great location  close to the beach and such a nice view. I can only recommend George‘s place!
11779611,Hannah May 2021 Nice Host  clean room with an amazing few 👌
11779611,Veronica August 2020 We can only recommend this apartment  location was perfect for us  as we didn't want to be in the middle of a town. The place is a bit separate but easy to drive everywhere from there and you have great viewsin the morning. In front of the apartments is a small and quiet beach  you just have to cross a transited road but it was fine. George is a great host  he was always available to any questions and gave us great recommendations 👍. We would definitely go back there. Thank you George.
11779611,Alessandro August 2020 George is an amazing host  he came to pick us up at the airport  gave us a little tips of where to go while we were driving to the place. He also gave us a bottle of cold water as the weather for extremely hot!  He booked us a taxi as there were not buses the morning we we flying and kept checking on us if everything was fine  Brilliant!!!  The place is a very simple place which has everything you need  an amazing view from the balcony and the aircon  make you love the place even more.  Only issue it might be is a bit far from the 2 villages around  however  if you rent a car   scpoter or quad  there is not problem.  Thabks George
11779611,Jack August 2020 Everything was very easy - kindly met us at the airport and dropped us to the accommodation. The room had everything we needed - air con- a little cooker (not that we used it often) the beach is a short walk from the apartment 2-3 mins( pebble beach). Further down the road there is a sandy beach which you can walk to in 5-10 min with a few tavernas and a mini market. Overall a nice trip and would recommend.
11779611,Erika July 2020 We absolutely loved staying at George's place. The place is remote but there are thing to do around  lovely private beach just 1min away from the apt. The apartment itself has everything you might need and a private terrace is a nice touch. George is incredibly hospitable to his guests  he answered all of my questions and helped us with everything  even picked us up from the airport. Truly a lovely place with a great host  would recommend this place to anyone.
11779611,Nick September 2019 We had a very pleasant stay in Corfu. The house is very central located  which is good for exploration for the island. We traveled by bus around the beautiful green island. There is a bus stop in front of the house  so that was very handy. George  the son of Spiros  picked us up from the airport and welcomed us in very friendly way. He gave us some good tips for exploring the island. The beaches  actually stony beaches  across the island have to most beautiful crystal water. I would recommend this place. You can have dinner outside and look at the sea. The road is a bit dangerous when your on foot  but you have a lot of fancy hotels in this area who have the same issue. Also  if you're coming in September bring something against wasps (incent) because its the season.
11779611,Alfonso August 2019 Very nice place next to the beach.
11779611,Deborah July 2019 Spiros's place was in a great location with it's own private beach. The road is busy  but there is double glazing and air conditioning at the apartment so it did not affect our stay and it was very quiet and private on the beach opposite which provided much needed shade in the afternoon/evening.
11779611,Nina June 2019 Very nice view from the apartment  very close to the beach (1 min walk) just across the street  has a very nice opportunity to sit outside in the evening (on the terrace or under the olive tree in the little garden)  kitchen equipment is only basic. George seems to be a very nice person and host!
11779611,"Marcel September 2018 George is a really great host and I have to say also... you won't believe how wonderful the view to the sea is  if you haven't been there. every morning you wake up with the sun shining in your face. if you wake up early enough you can watch a beautiful sunrise. in the beginning we wanted to go more often in the north- but in the end the location of the house was pretty Central to almost everything you need to see.. Korfu town is only 25 minutes with car  like the great beaches ""chilkounas"" and issos beach. supermarkets restaurants or bars are not even 10 minutes by car. you will have a private parking place  which is awesome! also  if you want to know anything about the island or history- he is the man! thanks again for the pleasent stay  we would definitely come back!"
11779611,Yevgen July 2018 We stayed there two weeks  it was a wonderful time  good and beautiful location  pleasant people  Spiros  his mother and father are of hearted family  agreeable  polite  helpful  caring for us. Appartmet is cozy  with all necessary conveniences. It is not surprising that this family (and other Corfiances) are polite and friendly - they live in a a very picturesque place i.e. the warm and clean sea  mountains of various sizes and forms   colorful sky  all this can seen an enjoyed 24 hours a day even from the house. Some 60 meters of direct walk  and you can can enjoy a salty warmth of the sea. Some 100 meters of walking and you can find a couple of small supermarkets  with a wide rage of food products  mostly of local producers  very tasty and delicious. Local bus trsansport is normally regular (as indicated in the timetable) bur a small hour buses i.e. buses at 5.00 or even 6.00 may skip theiry regularity  Yet the transport early morning irregularity cannot diminish pleasure of stay with Spiros and tle location of his appartment.
11779611,"Laurence September 2017 Spiros and his family are beautifull people and that is what makes this place so unique ! It is intimate  with a lot of charm and an amazing view on the blue blue sea  gorgeous sunrise!! A pretty garden of trees  grappes and flowers...the beach is quiet with chrystal clear water and beautifull rocs right across the road and down a small cliff ..there is a ""green bus"" stop in front of fortuna villa for corfu  two small shops down the road ..cafes and restaurants .The easiest way to get to fortuna villa from Corfu (drection kavos or messonghi ) is to stop at ""Senses corfu hotel ""and walk back about 200 metres .I love this place !!!"
11779611,Tovi0101 July 2017 The apartment is ideally located  25 minutes by car from Corfu Old Town  2-3 minutes on foot to a local restaurant (Kahlua bar with view on the sea) & 4 minutes by car (3 km) down the road to Moraïtika  a small touristic village with restaurants  bars  supermarkets etc. There's also a bus stop right in front of Villa Fourtuna to take you North or South of the island. Bus schedules are visible at the stop.  If you have rented a car  Villa Fourtuna has a private parking lot  which is a scarce commodity in Corfu!  Regarding the apartment/studio itself  it is very clean & proper  with basic amenities (hot water  kitchen appliances - stove  mini fridge  wardrobe etc.). It is well isolated from exterior sound & the balcony provides a nice view on the calm sea right in front of the apartment. Besides  you can take a dip in the sea just by crossing the road & going down a small path (1 min on foot).  The Wi-Fi signal was strong & stable right up to the toilet (you just can't get rid of your smartphone these days...) & on the balcony. We didn't use the mini-tv since we spent most of our time out.  Spiros/George was extremely helpful & was present each day on the premises. His advice on places & spots was most welcome & he responds rapidly on WhatsApp.  Thanks for the great time we had at Villa Fourtuna! Show more
11779611,Christine July 2017 We would definitely recommend this beautifully situated apartment. The beach is quiet with clear water and is just 50 meters away. There's a mini market and restaurants nearby. You can take the bus from Corfu city straight to the door for only 1.80 euro per person. There are only few kitchen supplies so you can't cook a big meal.
11779611,Nicole July 2017 Spiros' place is absolutely beautiful in a tranquil part of the island  beautiful swimming and waters  very little mega tourism loads of privacy and more than enough of the amenities you want. Excellent restaurants in the area. A hidden gem!!! Highly recommended.
11779611,Lorenzo August 2016 Greath experience at Villa Fortuna. It was very confortable with a very special sea view. Spiros is very kind. Appartments are very simply but useful.
11779611,Klara September 2022 The stay at Fourtouna Villa was great  it was clean and out like the pictures. George is really very nice and helpful if you have any questions you can always contact him. Everything is easily accessible by bus and taverns and mini-markets are within walking distance. Opposite is a small beach. All in all highly recommended!! Translated from German  Show original
11779611,Laurence August 2022 we had a great stay at Georges's. The view is magnificent. The photos are identical to the real. The small village is nice . The apartment is functional but lacks a few things to cook. We didn't mind because we were often outside and I think a lot of people are. The air conditioning is very nice. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Eugenie August 2022 Beautiful rental by the water. Ideally located  20 min from the airport   20 min from the beaches in the south but a little far from the busiest beaches of the north of the island. George and his family are very hospitable. The apartment is clean and functional. I highly recommend this rental. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Aline August 2022 Good location. Clean  simple and basic. Parking is available. The view is beautiful  the balcony pleasant. There is the passing road just below the unit. A small beach downstairs to cool down. George came to introduce himself  that's nice. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Alexandra August 2022 The description is consistent with the actual situation. The apartment is small but sufficient for a stay in summer. The furniture is outdated  the dishes are also and should also be added. The air conditioning  fridge and wifi work great. The road in front of the house is quite busy  even at night until about midnight. If you have the windows closed  you will not hear any of it. The beach at 40 m distance (with beach bar) is clean and quiet - loungers and umbrellas available. Taverns and mini market as well as car rental companies can be reached in about 15 minutes on foot: however  you have to walk along this busy road (without sidewalk)  certainly very dangerous with smaller children. George was not present at check-in because late at night  he was there for the check-out and helpful  in between communication great! The apartment is definitely recommended if you are not entitled to luxury. We enjoyed our stay. Translated from German  Show original
11779611,Fiona July 2022 Small rustic apartment but very clean and very well managed by the people who maintain it and who are adorable. Just downstairs is a beautiful cove with few people. This means that the property is on the side of the road and it is dangerous to walk around. You have to take the bus and ideally rent a scooter to visit the island. Thanks again for everything! Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Stéphanie July 2022 Nice  convenient and well located apartment. The beach is steps away from the accommodation for a morning swim  it's just nice. The hosts are great if you need help they are there. I would recommend this apartment. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Solene June 2022 A big thank you to George for hosting us. He made himself available and checked in during our stay to make sure everything went smoothly. The accommodation is well located and offers stunning views of the sea and the mountain range. What a pleasure to be able to enjoy such a setting. We highly recommend this host and their accommodation. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Valerie October 2021 We spent a week in Corfu and were super happy with the accommodation! You could enjoy breakfast on the balcony and enjoy the view of the sea. There was a parking lot and by car you were in Corfu city in half an hour. In addition  once you cross the road  you can hop directly into the sea. The host is nice and very helpful. Highly recommended! We will be happy to come back :) Translated from German  Show original
11779611,Jean-Baptiste September 2021 We had a lovely stay at George's. His apartment offers a view facing the sea  ideal for having breakfast in the morning! It is equipped with a kitchenette and fridge  very useful when it is 30°C outside. A small beach is within walking distance below  friendly for swimming in the morning. Shops and restaurants nearby but it's better to have a car to make the most of the island! We recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Raphaëlle September 2021 Airbnb very well located on the island of Corfu  close to the city of Corfu and the beautiful beaches/tourist sites of the island (about 1 hr 20 min for the most remote)  free and private parking for the residence on site (this is a real plus). The apartment itself is simple but sufficient for 2 people who are a lot outside. The view is sublime from the balcony where you can eat outside (a real plus on a nice day). Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Fabio August 2021 George is very willing and responsive to every request  highly recommended. The sister also gave us a bottle of wine when we arrived Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Mei August 2021 Ideal location for this accommodation  2 minutes from a small quiet beach. Close to several tavernas that serve good  fresh  typical dishes. The accommodation itself has good air conditioning  ideal for tackling the heat; for the rest  it's quite basic but sufficient when you spend a lot of time outdoors. Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Sara July 2021 Georges is very nice. a welcoming host who willingly helps. very good stay Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Achraf June 2021 I recommend it. George is very nice  even picked us up from the airport. Top location  right on the beach 🏝 Beautiful apartment & good surroundings. Very satisfied 😁 Thank you George & thanks Corfu 👋🏼 Translated from German  Show original
11779611,Lucile May 2021 Well-placed apartment  25 min from Corfu city center. Very quiet place with a great sea view. There is just a road below the apartment but it's not disturbing. You can access a small beach just below the apartment where the water is crystal clear and we could see two dolphins in the distance. The sun is present in the morning on the terrace and at the end of the day the terrace is in the shade which allows you to be a little cooler after days in the sun. There is enough to cook simple things (stove  fridge  kettle...). George is very accommodating and very easy to communicate with. We recommend this apartment! Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Christaline September 2020 Georges is a very friendly host  he welcomed us very warmly and informed us. Thank you 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Luca August 2019 We had a great time at Villa Fourtuna. Accommodation as described (in our case a studio with also a small kitchenette) complete with everything you need with the plus of a cove nearby. Attentive and accurate guest in communication. Happy to help! Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Anaïs August 2018 A pleasant stay with Spiros and his son! Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Antonio August 2018 Great hospitality. A short walk from the house is a gorgeous secluded beach. Truly a good place to enjoy the sea in peace Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Paul August 2018 We were extremely well hosted by Spiros and his family  who are very nice and do everything possible to make the stay enjoyable! The apartment is clean and above all very well located. Easy to reach by car or taxi  25 minutes from the center of Corfu  it offers direct access to a small beach a 1-minute walk away  literally at the bottom of the apartment (you have to cross a busy road though). The air conditioning makes the stay very pleasant after a hot day in the sun. The setting is really very pleasant  between the flowers and the fruit trees  not to mention the olive trees. Many shops are accessible not far from the apartment. We had a great time! Thanks Spiros  George and family:) Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Cyril August 2017 The welcome is very warm. Spiros and his family will welcome you with great care and kindness. The location is ideal as only 1 km from the seaside resort of Benitses where the hustle and bustle always reigns. If you want calm you will have some at Spiros and if you want shopping  restaurants or night life you go to Benitses.  Everything is easily accessible from the studio. The view is just splendid with sunrise in the morning and a total view of the Ionian Sea from your balcony from which you can see the Greek mountains in the distance.  The best is to have a vehicle to visit the north of the island and its fantastic coves or the small very warm port of Petriti just 20 minutes from the studio. I highly recommend this property which for a tight budget offers mold benefits + extraordinary hospitality. Safe Trip! Efkaristo Spiros!!! Show more Translated from French  Show original
11779611,Elena Sofia August 2017 We stayed for 10 at Villa Fortuna in a studio. The apartment is essential  small kitchen and bathroom  the beds are separate. The host provides all the linens  however  the towels (for the shower) are small  I recommend bringing them... the location overlooks the sea: across the road you will find yourself in a small piece of beach with crystal clear water! Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Ivonne August 2016 Spiros is a really nice character and very helpful! The little beach in front of the house is one of the most beautiful in Corfu! Highly recommended Translated from Italian  Show original
11779611,Melissa August 2016 The neighborhood was great because it was not full of tourists but at the same time convenient to all trips to its location  excellent reception  they picked us up at the airport and maximum availability  they accompanied us to rent a car in the village! I highly recommend it! Translated from Italian  Show original
14132429,András September 2022 It's a very well equipped house with good atmosphere and a beautiful view on the sea. It's in a touristy area  so you will find everything in walking distance  which is convenient. It's on the main road which leads to Paleokastritsia Monastery  Aquarium and some beaches so it's quite busy but the house is further back on the lot. The neighbor is a car/scooter rental place  that also adds traffic with all the noise and gas smell in the garden during the day. We had a great time here with our kids  Caroline got us a high chair and a baby cot - both helped a lot :) Thank you very much again!
14132429,Nick September 2022 This is a fantastic place to stay in Paleokastritsas - a great location  minutes from the beaches  and many restaurants. The host is very friendly and communicative  and the accommodation is clean and cosy  with some really helpful touches. Would recommend.
14132429,Oliver September 2022 Great stay  great location for beaches and restaurants  view was lovely  place has everything that was needed. It’s great.
14132429,Alice August 2022 Lovely place to stay  excellent value  such a beautiful view and setting.
14132429,Mark August 2022 Our stay at Pergola Cottage was perfect as was our host Caroline. Beautiful little cottage centrally located and close to lots of restaurants  the beach  shops/supermarkets (lovely one with bakery nearby) and some snack bar/pools. The cottage catered for all our needs and more and comfortably accommodated me and my wife and x3 teenagers (Caroline organised for a camp bed for the extra teenager). Caroline also adds the little extra touches like towels  beach towels  beach bag  iron & ironing board etc. We know the area really well but for anyone new to Corfu this is a beautiful little place in a beautiful resort which is busy by day with day trippers but lovely and quiet of a night. Thank you Caroline
14132429,Clare July 2022 Fabulous stay at Villa Pergola - ideally situated in the middle of Paleokastritsa  close to shops  restaurants and the main beaches. Loved the fact that it was a private cottage and had its own stoep and garden with lovely sea views and braai. The best find was the little beach down the stairs opposite the house which led to a quiet swimming spot. Thank you Caroline for your prompt communication. We caught the bus from Corfu just outside the port and were dropped a few meters from the house. Easily accessed up a small flight of stairs. Would definitely return.
14132429,Áine June 2022 We had a great stay at The Pergola. Great location and very clean. Had great amenities. Great communication with host also who was very helpful with everything. We were able to get a late check out and Caroline even arranged our taxis to and from the airport. Great trip :)
14132429,Elena June 2022 Unforgettable location. The house is top and the host too. I reccomend it strongly
14132429,Vilius May 2022 Nice and cozy appartment. In reality it is better than expected from photos :)
14132429,Sarah May 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Pergola! Great location. Small supermarkets and tavernas in walking distance. Grotto Bar had an beautiful setting 10 min walk away. House stayed cool in the sunshine. No TV but WiFi is great.  Recommend the tiny beach down some steps opposite the house. Enjoyed a day at Akron. Booked sunloungers online and stayed all day & for dinner! Did a food & culture tour in Corfu Town with Corfu Walking Tours which was great fun.  There for a week  no need to hire a car. Got green bus to town for tour. Caroline kindly organised a taxi to and from the airport (45E each way).  Def recommend staying here  and would stay again.
14132429,Sasha April 2022 The cottage was perfect for the four of us. We visited Paleokastritsa in early April so most restaurants/bars were shut but we still had a lovely time sunbathing at the nearby beaches and renting a boat to explore the coastline. Paleokastritsa is by far the most beautiful place I’ve visited and this cottage was the perfect base. Caroline is a lovely host with great communication and even arranged a taxi for us.
14132429,Burkhard October 2021 Pergolas Cottage was a beautiful place to stay  the communication went great and the apartment was more than we expected  definitely a recommendation!
14132429,Vanessa September 2021 The stay at Pergola Cottage was amazing and Caroline was a really nice host. Everything you need is in the house (coffee maker  hot water boiler  microwave  parasol  cool bag and much more) and we did not miss anything. Every morning  we enjoyed our breakfast at the terrace with a beautiful view to the sea! Furthermore  the house is perfectly located between restaurants  supermarkets etc. The only thing that could be improved are the beds  which were a bit uncomfortable  as well as the door to the bedrooms  as we could not close them completely. But these are just little things and we would definitely come back!
14132429,Alexandre September 2021 The Pergola is a charmful place. It is in the center of the tourist zone of paleokastrítsa. You will be able to go to several beaches  diving club and restaurants by foot. You will be at 30 meters of the supermarket  a good hotel with a breakfast  several cocktail bar  a nice restaurant etc. The place is still silent and you won't feel to live next to the road.  The schedule was easy and our host was really nice: recommended ++
14132429,Robert August 2021 Our 2 week stay at Pergola Cottage was fantastic. Carolyne was a great host and answered our many questions. The cottage is in an excellent location and very close to the beach and restaurants. It was clean  charming and comfortable. We highly recommend it to others. Bob Valérie Andrea
14132429,Julia August 2021 This is the best place to stay in Corfu island. Paleokastrirsa is the most beautiful area and this villa is a gem! Every good comment about this place is absolutely true. We highly recommend Pergola Cottage to everyone. You will be pleased and satisfied.
14132429,Victoria July 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Villa Pergola. The house is very well located and has been furnished with attention to detail. Restaurants and the beach are within walking distance  and the house has a garden with a terrace with sea view. Caroline and her husband are great hosts and we felt very comfortable.
14132429,Tom July 2021 This villa is in a great location  close to shops  restaurants and beaches. There is also a bus stop and car rental place very nearby. It is equipped with all the kitchen essentials and has an amazing view of the sea from the garden. Caroline was extremely helpful and responded very quickly to our questions. There is a cooler and beach umbrellas to take to the beach as well which we found very useful. We hope to go back again soon!
14132429,Yulia July 2021 We’ve had great time at this wonderful place! In heart of paleokastritsa with a great view! The house is so cute and cozy and decorated with love and style! We were nicely surprised to find few bottle of water in the fridge  also some snacks and other goodies in the bathroom! There’s enough place to relax  inside and outside the house! Caroline was very helpful in all the aspect- beginning with meeting us on the road to organizing the corona test appointments for us! Thank you so much for your hospitality!
14132429,Dimitar June 2021 There are a few things to be said about this accommodation and all of them are positive. Starting with the communication with Caroline - quick and easy. Location - can't be better in my opinion  as we found that Paleokastritsa is probably the best place to have as a base to explore the island  while the resort itself has everything you need - great restaurants (Meraklis  Greek Taverna  Spiros Taverna  Il Pozzo all great)  good bars (La Grotta)  supermarkets  boat rentals and the nicest people you'll ever meet are next door ar George Michalas Rent-a-car!! The cottage itself is brilliant - has everything you need  plus everything you didn't know you needed. Value is second to none. And lastly  the view from the garden is something you'll remember your whole life. I think I already implied that I recommend the place and will be going back! :) Response from Pergola June 2021 Thank you Dimitar - I'm glad you both enjoyed you stay and I do hope you will return.
14132429,Felix September 2020 Lovely host. Had a great time there. The view is gorgeous and everyone super friendly in the neighborhood. Thanks
14132429,Andrea August 2020 Great location  amazing view and beautiful house with garden. Right place to stay in Paleokastritsa
14132429,Teresa August 2020 We arrived late and Caroline had thoughtfully left us some drinks and tea/coffee and milk for the morning. What a wonderful surprise we got the next morning opening our shutters and the door to a stunning view! We spent a lot of time sitting admiring the view and it felt very safe and private. The villa is in a great location within walking distance to a supermarket with fresh bread daily  restaurants where everyone seemed to remember us and next door to a car hire place. We went to the beach club Akron one day and enjoyed a pool experience  bookings can be made online. All of this is within walking distance. We did hire a car but parking is a bit hit or miss and it is not needed if you want to enjoy the villa and local amenities. One drive we did do and highly recommend was a trip into the hills behind the villa to Lakrones and Makrades where we found some restaurants and good shopping for local items. The villa had lots of nice touches also  a day trip to the beach was a lot easier having the beach umbrellas and a cool bag  we found this really useful. Everything you need can be found at the villa. We preferred to sit outside and admire the view but there was plenty of space and seating to sit inside if you wanted to. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and having two toilets was also very convenient. This is a great location  comfortable facilities and a friendly host and I would highly recommend staying here. Show more
14132429,Jen August 2020 What a beautiful place of the world! Caroline and her daughter Eve could not have been more helpful  we were able to check in early and check out late at no extra cost  arranged a taxi back to the airport for us and made sure we were safe when there was a thunderstorm. Perfect communication and just lovely to deal with in general! The villa was very clean and set up with everything my husband and I needed  it’s spacious and has a lovely outdoor space which overlooks the sea. I would not hesitate to recommend Villa Pergola  it made our trip really special  we didn’t want to leave!!
14132429,Rob September 2019 We had a wonderful week in Villa Pergola. Caroline was so helpful and responsive  facilities were perfect  and great location. Noise from the road was minimal but advantage is you have everything you meed nearby. Local bar/ cafe next door (free pool table!)  2 mini supermarkets and choice of great restaurants. There’s a very quiet mini beach down steps almost opposite villa which has perfect bay to swim and explore. 15 min walk to harbour and 3 or 4 other beaches. Trip to Monastery is a must and we hired small boat for a day which was superb. We’ll be back!
14132429,Tara August 2019 A lovely house which is close to the beach  restaurants and supermarkets. The hosts went out of their way to find a high chair for us and there were lots of lovely touches in the house Would throughly recommend!
14132429,Guy July 2019 Pefect location A special little villa No car rental is needed It is better to travel on public transport
14132429,Ian July 2019 What a fantastic location! This home is situated within walking distance of all of Paleo’s fabulous beaches. The home is perched up above the road so that the view and privacy is maximized and the sound reduced. All the features needed for our family’s week long stay where met. There were items for the beach including towels  lounges and an umbrella. The bedding  furniture and bathrooms were top notch.  The host was very helpful in the weeks leading up to our stay to discuss transfer options to the home. In the end we had her arrange a taxi.  Some hints: Grocery stores 50 meters to the right and to the left. Good choices for basics. Book Lounge Chairs at Akron Bar the night before. They are 15€ or 10€ and are yours all day long. They also to food service to your chairs. Boat rental from Paleo Sea. They have great boats and actually came out to check on us during the day if everything was fine. Picked us up from house and drove us to marina and home too. Water toy rentals from Michaels Boats next to Akron Bar 10€/hour Treat yourself once to a dinner at Akron Restaurant. Otherwise  Nausica Tavern was our favourite. Bring your IDL if you plan to rent a car. The car rental place next door would not rent to me without one.  After months of research this home was my top pick for the price point. It exceeded our expectations and we are already planning for a return. Show more
14132429,Ciaran July 2019 Caroline and Georges's House was amazing. Great location. Outside shower  private garden. Lots of thoughtful touches books  soap  condiments.......beautiful part of Corfu. Great hosts who facilitated a later check out as our flight was late in the evening. Highly recommend.
14132429,Liza-Marie July 2019 Stayed here after 10 days of travelling across various parts of Greece  best accommodations we had throughout the trip. Fantastic location  lovely place and Caroline was very kind and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
14132429,Zach June 2019 Villa Pergola was an amazing place to stay in Corfu for our family of 4. We stayed 5 nights and loved the local area and all the restaurants. Caroline left some great suggestions for the local area as well. The front yard was a great place to relax at the end of the day and as hot as it was  we took full advantage of the outdoor shower! Our favorite beach was the small one you could walk down to right across the street from the house. If we ever came back to Corfu we would stay here again. Thanks for a great visit!
14132429,Gethin June 2019 Loved this place. A perfect set up for 2 adults and 1/2 kids. Great tavernas and supermarkets either side. Choice of 5 beaches within a km  the closest being 100m away. We hiked up to Lakones and the Monastery. Well worth it. All in all  surpassed expectation.
14132429,Josefien June 2019 Pergola is a charming house with amazing view. The area is friendly with small shops  nice restaurants cafés and beaches. We had a great holiday! Response from Pergola June 2019 Josifien and her family were lovely guests. They left the house nice and clean.
14132429,Joanne May 2019 Caroline's House had everything we needed and more. From the location  to the layout to the extra little bits of everything you would need to stay for a short or a long break. The garden and veranda are a perfect spot to relax  not to mention the stunning sea view. Two of the best restaurants on the doorstep  O Merkilos and Gran Aladino. One beach 2 minutes from the door. La Grotto an amazing cove with cliffs and swimming and other beaches all within walking distance. Bus stop to Corfu town outside. I cannot recommend this listing enough so much so we are hoping to return. Many Thanks Caroline and George
14132429,Carin October 2018 We had fantastic stay at Villa Pergola- one cannot ask for a better location  close to tavernas  restaurants  supermarkets and beaches. We can honestly recommend this villa and we will definitely book it again should we ever have the privilege to return to Corfu.
14132429,Ole Petter September 2018 pergola is a nice place. Many restaurants near and some beautiful beaces.
14132429,Nadzeya July 2018 We had a wonderful stay with my family in this house. It has a great view over the sea  closely located to traditional tavernas  beach  and the bus stop  which allows to get to the city by public transport. Would love to be back!
14132429,Anna June 2018 We chose Villa Pergola for our first holidays with our one year old baby. It was a great choice! The baby had a great time in the garden watching flowers or ants. There are a few steps in the garden  but except of that it is fully safe for a baby. An outside shower made it even more fun. We were amazed with all the amenities at the house. Whatever we though would be useful was there. I mean not only the kitchen equipment  but also things like a reusable shopping bag  an umbrella  mosquito repellents  beach towels  a dryer with pegs  and even a tiny inflatable baby pool! Caroline thought also of things that I am usually missing in Airbnb appartments  like kitchen cloths (there were plenty of them). The house is truly beautiful. I love the way it was decorated  using local craft and handmade furniture. Exactly the opposite of way that hotel rooms are decorated. We felt very cozy there. It was a pleasure just to be there. Both the living room and the verrandah are equipped with a dining table and a coffee table. That gives a lot of opportunities to spend a great time even if the weather is not great. The view is just breathtaking! It looks amazing in the morning  during the sunset  and during lunch too.. The nearest beach is just about 5 minutes away walking. Getting to the main beach takes several minutes. But there are also a few beaches that you can reach only from the sea. I recommend taking a motorboat taxi and explore them. Beach boots and a snorkeling set are a must have. The bus stop to Korfu is less than a minute away. Or you can rent a car next door. For vegetarian options I recommend Gran Aladino. We also loved Astacos restaurant with Italian food. Greek salad is great in every restaurant there. I really hope I can come back to Paleokastritsa one day. Thank you Caroline for being a great host!

14132429,Bettina May 2018 Very nice stay  very welcoming couple. The house is clean  calm  and with a great view. The beach is 100m far. Thank you again Caroline
14132429,Franziska April 2018 The appartment is very beautiful. We loved the terrasse and garden with the view on the ocean. Its a 5 min walk from to the small beautiful beach. The appartment is by the main street of the town  so there is a boat and car rental right next to it. We were there in april so not all of the restaurants and bars were open but the owner gave as great tips and recommondations about places to go. Lovely people and great communication! Thanks again!
14132429,Ilke September 2017 Pergola's is in the heart of Paleokastritsa. We found it a great location to explore the beautiful northern sights of Corfu island! Because it's right on the main road from Corfu town  it's also quite easy to go to/from old town if you're traveling with a car: no turns  just a 25-30 minute straight drive. The villa has a enclosed parking space on a minor slope  a few steps away.  As for the space itself  it was clean with every amenity you need for a long-term stay. For those who like to enjoy some drinks before the sunset  the yard provides just the setting. It can get a bit noisy at night since there are bars and a motor rental next door  but the bedrooms seem to be well insulated.  Caroline was friendly  immediately there to help us settle in  and prompt with communication. Our only concern was internet access  but Caroline tried her best to address the issue.
14132429,Galina Shagieva August 2017 Beautiful and comfortable place to stay! Response from Pergola September 2017 Thank you for being such good guests.
14132429,Nancy August 2017 Nice simple house with lots of space in a great location with lovely garden and beautiful unencumbered view of the bay. Caroline and George are excellent hosts.  Paleokastritsa is heavenly.  Enjoyed Corfiat specialities and fish platter at Alipa restaurant by marina  Akron Beach bar with pool and recommend Aquarium and Reptile centre with great sun terrace and beach/snorkelling at the back.  Veranda Restaurant in nearby Lakones was really special with superb fresh food  local wine  great service and stunning view.
14132429,Ulysse July 2017 We spent a lovely week in Villa Pergola with our two children in July 2017. The villa is located in Paleokastritsa close to all amenities. We took pleasure having breakfast on the terrace every morning  looking at the sea view. The house is well equiped and nicely decorated. Caroline and George are nice and welcoming hosts!
14132429,Jonathan July 2017 Fantastic position  perfect for restaurants  the beaches and a base to further explore Corfu. Comfortable and everything you require for your stay. Caroline makes the perfect host and was very helpful in organising car hire  taxis etc. Very enjoyable stay in a beautiful part of the Island.
14132429,Merel July 2017 We absolutely loved the accomodation! The apartment is very spacious  nice decorated and has a beautiful view from the big garden/terrace. George and Caroline are great hosts. We definitely would stay here again!
14132429,Florian May 2017 This is a beautiful place with very nice hosts. We enjoyed every minute  thank you for a wonderful week!
14132429,Marika April 2017 Suurepärane koht ja suurepärased inimesed: väga külalislahked ja abivalmis! Väga soovitatav!
14132429,Billy October 2016 Lovely  simple villa in great location. We visited at the end of the season so everything very calm and quiet. Beach 3 mins walk across small road and down steps. Plenty of tavernas in immediate area but definitely worth exploring further a field as the island has so much to see. Great hosts. Thank you!
14132429,Bastian October 2016 Caroline and George were perfect hosts  from the beginning of our trip until the end. The communication between Caroline and us via email was easy and fast. They were waited infront of the house as we arrived and they have shown us the property and the parking spot for our rental car. Everything was just as described. They also left water  milk  juice and some breakfast bits at the kitchen!! The bay view from the terraces was just amazing. Altough we traveled in october we could enjoy several sunsets. We definitly can recommend the accommodation to everyone.
14132429,Katie September 2016 We had the most amazing experience. Caroline and George were so sweet. We mentioned it was our honeymoon and they brought us a bottle of prosecco when we got there. The space itself is wonderful! The view for the garden in front is beautiful every morning we ate breakfast there!
14132429,Pepita September 2016 We were made to feel very welcome - fabulous place to base exploring the area - lovely view sitting out in garden over the bay - thoroughly recommend for your stay in paleocastrits
14132429,Lorna August 2016 I feel extremely lucky to have spotted Villa Pergola as a brand new posting on Airbnb and  along with my 15 year old daughter and her friend  to be one of the first guests to stay there. The Villa is a former bar  renovated by hosts Caroline and George with close attention to detail and great taste  both inside and out - the garden offering an equally lovely space with a picture postcard view of the sea. It is as aesthetically pleasing as the photographs of the villa suggest and  has all the facilities which we might have needed including a hairdryer and mosquito plugs (neither of which I can remember being listed in the description). Caroline and George were wonderful hosts  friendly and welcoming  discrete but immediately available if we had any queries  and very informative. Paleakastrista is composed of a series of small beaches and coves or grottos forming a stunning coastline. The nearest beach is less than five minutes away from Villa Pergola  and the main beach and modest harbour a short walk away. There are lots of great places to eat  Alladino's being especially good for vegetarians and vegans on an island that is primarily notable for its fresh fish and seafood. The area has a buzz but is far from being overwhelmingly touristy or noisy at night. Most accommodation is located along the single main road which runs along the coast. The road can be busy but the villa is set back and up from the road (you climb a small number of steps to get to it)  so it gives a sense of being private and sheltered even though there is a (very useful) car hire service next door. We didn't make it to the castle  which is located further up the coast  but we did visit the local monastery with its exquisite views and olive oil  cold-pressed on site. All in all  we felt we'd found a gem in Villa Pergola and its hosts and  given the chance  we would keep the letting as our secret. I'm sure we will be back - Lorna  Ettie and Ella.

14132429,Alexander October 2022 It was a gorgeous stay at Villa Pergola in Paleokastritsa! We enjoyed the time very much  the location is perfectly central and walking distance to the beach. There are many grocery shopping and dining options around the corner.  Communication with the host went smoothly. She is very accommodating and tries to take care of all the concerns that concern you.  Even though the property  which has a terrace and a garden with sun loungers  is located on the main street of the place  it was quiet and we did not notice any great noise. The location is priceless. Directly next door is the very nice George  who offers rental cars for a good price.  Unfortunately at that time we had a (as we said was extraordinarily strong) mosquito plague and had to kill a lot of it. The kitchen was sufficiently well-equipped  if not abundant. This is where we bought  for example  an extra cutting board or a peeler. Also  the walls are very thin  which is why our little son woke up the other room early on.  But that was the only minor criticism. We enjoyed the time very much and would vacation there again at any time! Show more Translated from German  Show original
14132429,Joanna August 2022 Fantastic location. Close to the sea. Nearby shops and eateries. The cottage has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Amenities. In front of the patio with deck chairs and a shower  it's great for sunbathers. There is also a seating set with four lounge chairs and a dining table in front of the cottage. Equipped with all the essentials. It was really nice that the landlord took care of things like coffee  water  and milk. It was the perfect place to have a coffee while we were looking at the sea. The patio overlooks the sea. It's a really great location and nice place. We loved it. Translated from Polish  Show original
14132429,Patrice June 2022 the house is charming and with a beautiful view  the scooter landlord next door was very friendly with us and very careful not to make noise too early or late. the house is quiet and the neighborhood too. pay attention we went there a little before the start of the summer season. access to beaches and restaurants can be done on foot 10-15 minutes max and the bus stop of the green line is very close to the house. Translated from French  Show original
14132429,Pauline April 2022 We had a perfect stay at Caroline's place! The location is ideal  in one of the most beautiful places on the island. The property has a sea view that you can't get enough of. Very nice covered terrace. Everything is within walking distance: supermarkets  taverns  beaches  monastery (about 30 min). Parking space behind the accommodation which is very convenient because the road below is quite busy. Car rental (Georges) in terraced area  very nice. We have chosen to rent our car at the airport as we arrived late but it is possible to take a bus and rent directly on site. The accommodation is well equipped  Caroline is very accommodating and full of small special touches (beds made   necessary for breakfast juice  coffee  tea  water  milk). One of the bedrooms does not have shutters  the mattresses are a little firm but it is a personal feeling because my spouse slept very well. I would 100% recommend this place for a pleasant stay. Translated from French  Show original
14132429,Cathy August 2021 We thoroughly enjoyed our week-long stay here. For starters  the location is perfect. On the most beautiful bay on the island  a magnificent view. Many tavernas within a 5-minute walk  a small very convenient supermarket a two-minute walk away with all the amenities you need (including the afternoon cold coffee and ice cream for dessert). The beach is also a 5-minute walk (pebbles). There is a private parking space at the back of the cottage. The garden is very nice with an outdoor shower (very convenient when returning from the beach)  deckchairs  garden furniture and a table and chairs in the shade of the canopy. The interior is very tastefully decorated and there too there is everything you need: full kitchen equipment  air conditioning in the main room  fan in each room. Several bath towels per person. Also a very convenient cooler and umbrella for beach days. Some reviews mentioned noise from dogs and the neighboring car landlord. Obviously no more dogs. The neighboring car rental actually makes a little noise but with a 5-year-old we got up early and it didn't bother us at all. Caroline and her husband are very welcoming. We therefore recommend this rental without a problem  which is perfect! Translated from French  Show original
14132429,Nataliy September 2019 We spent an unforgettable 10 days at Villa Pergola! Many thanks to Caroline and her husband for the hospitality! All the pictures are accurate. Everything was great from meeting us to our departure. We were two couples in the villa. At our request  the towels were changed and at any point when we contacted Caroline - everything was very well organized. From the villa to the best beach you can walk about 100 meters  to other beaches about 300 meters. The villa has everything you need. We will definitely be back and staying at Caroline's place.

14132429,Alice August 2019 Very nice house in a nice corner of Paleokastritsa The terrace and garden are a big plus The view is superb A few small local restaurants nearby and a more trendy beach bar on the beach (with pool) The smell of frangipani trees in the morning and evening would delight us. Ideal for a couple with 2 children George The car/scooter rental just next door is lovely Go there without so much as a second thought Translated from French  Show original
14132429,Éric August 2019 Charming little roadside villa with very nice views of the adjacent bay. Villa Pergola stands out for its strategic location in Paleokastritsa with regard to the proximity of services (restaurant  mini market  renters   beaches   etc.). The layout of the villa is pleasant. Unfortunately  you can't serenely enjoy the garden because of the proximity to the road that the land overlooks. The nuisance is important (noise and pollution). The landlord's neighborhood is certainly convenient for tenants and the managers are charming. However  their barking dog is a real hit  especially at the end of the day. However  we will remember Caroline's kindness  very attentive and kind. Translated from French  Show original
14132429,"Thomas July 2019 this is our favorite part of our trip to Corfu ! In this house  everything is done to make you feel good : it is fully equipped and well decorated  the garden and view are incredible  access to the beaches is easy ( the nearest is 100 m  20 min walk to the main beach)  there are a few tavernas (special mention for the ""gran aladino"") and a convenience store right next door. Despite the proximity to the road and the car rental in the adjoining house  the environment is relatively quiet. Thanks to Caroline for her kindness... We recommend without hesitation :-) Translated from French  Show original"
14132429,Anneke May 2019 Had a wonderful week in Corfu. Villa Pergola is really nice. Beautiful garden with very nice views. Breakfast is a real party overlooking the bay. We thought this was the most beautiful side of the island. The city of Corfu 25 minutes away by car is really very cozy. Otherwise seen beautiful nature - lots of hiking.

14132429,Judith April 2019 The location of the apartment is great  as is the view. We have arranged for breakfast outside in the quiet garden. All amenities are as expected and therefore fine.

14132429,Jörg October 2018 Positive:   - Easy and fast contact with the landlords - very nice terrace area with numerous seating options and fantastic sea views - good service (e.g. weekly towel change; organization of a taxi transfer) - Numerous supermarkets and taverns nearby - Tip: Gran Aladino (very good cuisine  fair value for money) - Good transport location of the place for excursions by car - clean  still pleasantly warm water in October; the sandy pebble beaches of the individual bays are usually relatively narrow and rather nondescript  but not crowded in the off-season; beach tip: Glyfada- Beach (large  clean  beautiful waves)  Suggested improvements:  - Brighter lighting in the bathroom and cooking area - Replacement of the unkept oven with cooking function - Replacement of the mattresses of the single beds  which offer little comfort for people with back problems.

27888426,Andrew September 2022 Sophia’s property is the perfect place to relax in heavenly Glyfada. Waking to the sound or waves and having breakfast and dinner on the terrace while contemplating the fabulous view of the sea: truly unforgettable. The beach is a quick walk down some steps and you can stay at that end or explore further down the the shore for more space and privacy. At night you have the moon on the glistening water with the gentle cooling breeze; one could stay forever. The flat is very well-equipped with a clean  white  minimalist aesthetic. The bedroom comfortably sleeps 2 and the closet  although not large  is great for organising your holiday wardrobe. Lovely bathrobes and lots of towels provided. The kitchen has all you need to fix breakfast and simple meals at home. Some lovely complimentary local delicacies await you  as well as coffee and plenty of water! Keep on mind that the local market is limited and quite expensive so you may wish to go further inland on the main road for a proper shop if staying more than a few days. There are some good restaurant options and snack bars along the beach as well. Sophia was quick to respond and solve any little issues. An unusually high quality Airbnb experience. Highly recommended!
27888426,Benjamin August 2022 The appartement is very nice and well equipped. Sophia is a very kind and helpful host. The beach is only 5min by foot. From the balcony you can enjoy a beautiful sea-view and sunset. Corfu city is easy to reach by bus. One of the best airbnb we ever had.
27888426,Anne-Sofie July 2022 We really loved our stay  and the location is perfect. Sophia and her son helped us with everything  and is very quick to respond even though they were at vacation they helped us with everything.  I would 100% recommend this apartment  and we will hopefully be back ❤️
27888426,Lilli June 2022 Sophia and her son Vassilis were the best hosts. They welcomed us warmly  helped us with the booking of the rental car and assisted us with all other questions. Their recommendations were very helpful and thanks to them  we had an unforgettable vacation. The apartment is quietly located with a charming view over the water. It has everything you need for a summer vacation  including beach chairs and umbrella. The beach is within walking distance and offers a clean sandy beach with crystal clear water. This booking was a stroke of luck!
27888426,Jonathan June 2022 From the moment we made the booking Sofia was incredible helpful and approachable.

27888426,Daniel July 2021 Great Apartment in a calm area! The apartment is very nice  clean and has everything in it you need (e.g. a Nespresso).

27888426,Andrew October 2019 I stayed in Sophia's place for a week  and it was superb. This is a fantastic spot for a relaxed holiday.  The place is a three minute walk to Glyfada beach  which is relatively quiet. The whole area is quiet  so if you're looking for some peace  this is perfect. That said  you will likely want a vehicle if you want to explore more of Corfu and visit supermarkets/grocers.  The space itself is spotlessly clean and stylishly decorated. There's a large balcony with beautiful views over the ocean and beaches  where you can sunbathe in privacy during the day and watch spectacular sunsets or moonscapes at night. All of the amenities were great  with WiFi available  hot water  clean linen  and a fully functioning kitchen that you can use to cook proper meals in.  The best part about staying with Sophia was her responsiveness and willingness to go the extra mile. She and her partner greeted me in person on arrival  with a bunch of personal touches and local delicacies on the table as welcome gifts. She also arranged a rental vehicle  airport transfers and more  at competitive prices and all were really reliable and easy.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay with Sophia again  and would highly recommend her place in the future - thank you Sophia. Show more
27888426,Judith October 2022 A beautiful apartment with an incredible view of the bay. In the apartment  everything you need for a vacation is available. We really enjoyed the time and would come back anytime! Translated from German  Show original
27888426,Sandra September 2022 Beautiful  newly renovated  well-equipped apartment. Sophia always responds very quickly and is very helpful! It was also nice to find the fridge with water bottles and soda! Thank you for that! The beach in Glyfada is magnificent  the water is crystal clear. Too bad there are unfortunately no good restaurants in Glyfada. Translated from German  Show original
27888426,Marie August 2022 I just have one word to say about this stay: fantastic! Sophia is an amazing host  very attentive to these tenants. Very responsive and available  she will do everything to make your trip easier  which is very pleasant. Most importantly  it's amazing. The apartment is impeccably clean  tastefully decorated. It has two very nice terraces  and the pretty beach of Glyfada is a 3-minute walk away. In addition  you will find all amenities. We went as a couple and we will keep very nice memories of it... we hope to even come back! A big thank you Sophia ☺️ Translated from French  Show original
27888426,Luca August 2022 A truly spectacular house with all the comforts. Sophia and her husband are available throughout. I recommend you don't miss it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Translated from Italian  Show original
27888426,Dennis July 2021 We liked the apartment very much  especially the large balcony with sea view is really fantastic. The equipment is new and modern. The beautiful sandy beach can be reached in a few minutes via a direct path from the apartment. Unfortunately  we did not meet Sophia personally  but the communication was still very excellent; she took care of us movingly and was always available during our stay. It was also great that she had already provided food and drinks for us; overall a very clear recommendation and many thanks again to Sophia! Translated from German  Show original
27888426,Pascal July 2021 A really nice apartment in a top location with a very helpful hostess. Definitely recommended! Translated from German  Show original
27888426,"Erik August 2019 We were very warmly welcomed by Sophia and her husband. First impressions of the apartment were ""Wow!“ The view of the bay of Glyfada is a dream. There is a balcony and a terrace (both with sea view) and an outdoor shower. We found these very practical when we came from the sea and could rinse off outside. The apartment was sparkling clean and modernly renovated and decorated with a lot of love for detail. There was a basket of local products (fruit  cakes  honey...) water and wine  Nespresso capsules. The kitchen included everything you need. There were bathrobes and slippers - luxury. (Clad in our bathrobes we sat on the balcony in the evening and looked at the sea. The colors were great!) The air conditioning in the apartment worked well. There was a fan in the bedroom. The sofa in the living room was very comfortable. Not to mention the toiletries from The Bodyshop in the bathroom. The place has a supermarket  restaurants and bars. We recommend: Glyfada Mexas Club (the pastitsada is great). Our hiking tip: past the Glyfada Mexas Club  at the end of the bay (behind the abandoned house) up the small rocky path into the neighboring bay. At the top of the mountain you can take a break at Elia Taverna and then continue for a swim in the Myrtiotissa Bay or to the Myrtiotissa Monastery. The island's capital  Kerkyra  is only 30 minutes away by car. We were in contact with Sophia and received quick answers to questions. She is a super host. We have recovered really well and will be happy to come back. Thanks  Sophia! Show more Translated from German  Show original"
903081,Christine November 2022 Just a beautiful place. One of my favourite things to do was sit on the balcony reading a book with a cup of tea  looking out to Kalafationes forest. Spacious apartment  really clean and comfortable. Outstanding and friendly hosts. Dogs met me every morning for hugs. Loved every day of my 7 weeks in Corfu.
903081,Jan September 2022 Beautiful quiet location and super nice hosts 🙌🏼
903081,Cécilia August 2022 Vivian and Sal are exceptionnels persons always ready to help you whatewer happens. Do not hesitat to rent their house. The terrasse is great with a wonderful view and well furnished. We stay one week and I broke my foot so I had plenty of time to appreciate this place you feel like at home. All the taverns around are very good.
903081,Begona August 2022 We really enjoy our stay at Villa Zoe. The house is very comfortable  the location is good and the views amazing! The house got sometimes too warm during high temperatures in August  and the airco helped! Thanks Vivian and Sal for all recommendations and calls you made for us to get a table in nice restaurants! We love Mario’s visits and poems. We fell in love with this amazing island and people!
903081,Theresa July 2022 I stayed here with my 2 children and from beginning to end it was a wonderful experience. Vivian and Sal were very thoughtful hosts. Sal made our arrival so easy by picking us up at the airport. They made us feel so much at home for our two weeks stay. The place itself was perfect. Beds were very comfortable  all the little things I needed to cook and good coffee. Stunning views of the sunset and a perfect shaded veranda. Would absolutely recommend. I look forward to returning  especially for Vivian’s powerfully healing treatments. It really is a mountaintop retreat. Thank you Vivian and Sal 🙏
903081,Jennifer July 2022 Peaceful and so beautiful place with the calm around. The hospitality and the kindness of our host was a part of our happiness to be there. The location is perfect to explore the island and to ending the day perfectly when coming back to enjoy the night with the sunset. I highly recommend this place. Thanks for all ❤️❤️❤️
903081,Atticus July 2022 A really special place hosted by really special folks. The perfect location on middle the island: to avoid tourist centers when you want to be far away  and a short most beautiful drive to anywhere if you wanna dive in any color water or local dish.
903081,Eva May 2022 Vivians place is the perfect holiday destination if you love peace and quiet with having the ability to b everywhere within 20 minutes. The apartment I spacious and has everything one needs.  The big terrace let us spend our days and evenings relaxing and enjoying the beautiful views.  Vivians husband came to get us when we got lost finding the air bnb in the first place and was always happy to help with recommendations.  Well worth a trip.  Thanks Sal and Vivian.
903081,Doug May 2022 FABULOUS. We have stayed at many Airbnbs and this is the best by far. Sal and Vivian are superb hosts really going the extra mile  Sal picked up take away the first night for us and dropped off croissants another day. More like staying with family/friends than anything else. The flat is very well furnished and extremely comfortable. The extras they provided – teas  coffees  cooking bits  shower gels etc – are all generous and very nice. Location is really great  quiet and peaceful whilst being very close to Corfu town and nice beaches. Garden  sunsets and animals around the place are beautiful.
903081,Lukas April 2022 We had a beautiful time at the Villa Zoe. Vivian and Sal are very friendly and their animals are very sweet and friendly too. The accomodation has everything it needs. We woke up every morning to the beautiful view on the mountains. Kalafationes is a nice little village. Beaches and the centre of Corfu City were not far to reach by car. We would always come back.
903081,Janett April 2022 Vivian and Sal gave us a great holiday experience. The apartment is spacious  clean and super comfy. The terrace has a great view and the spot is a good starting point to explore the island. Thanks & see you soon.
903081,Rabea October 2021 Beautiful  cozy and well equipped apartment with a gorgeous view! Vivian and Sal are great and heart-warming hosts  they were always available whenever we had questions or needed something! The place is a great spot from where you can discover the island  in a very natural and quiet surrounding  but still close to Corfu-City and several beaches  perfect! I can definitely recommend staying here and would love to come back one day!
903081,Lori October 2021 There are not enough words for this beautiful place or its hosts! Sal and Vivian went way out of there way to make our stay perfect. The location and accommodations couldn't be better if you are looking for beauty and tranquility.
903081,Milena September 2021 A really amazing place! Calm and spacious apartment  warm hosts  charming dogs & cats available for cuddling. We received some great recommendations about the area and we got the best possible sleep conditions.
903081,Dimitri September 2021 Vivian and Sal really showed a lot of hospitality  even when there were some difficulties (e.g. water was down for a day) they quickly helped us out. Vivian also gave us a ton of recommendations together with a map of Corfu  which helped us plan.  The only thing is that it's somewhat far from most restaurants or supermarkets  so be ready to always go by car (but usually only 15-20 min).  Overall great place and is even bigger than it looks on the photos!
903081,Mireia August 2021 We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Zoe. It was a quiet place where we could unwind after a day visiting the island. Vivian and Sal were friendly and always available for our questions. Moreover  she gave us lots of recommendations regarding restaurants and activities to do in Corfu. Kalafationes is a nice village and there is a great restaurant where you can have dinner and enjoy a nice atmosphere. We would definitely recommend Villa Zoe and would like to come back soon.
903081,Alexandra July 2021 It was the best Airbnb experience ever! Wonderful house with everything you need  terrific view on forrest and sunsets  comfortable bedroom and terrace  quite and piece in the village.  Dear Vivian and Sal  thank for your hospitality and help with travel and local places tips  we would love to come back.  Sincerely yours  Alexandra & Dimitry
903081,Clara July 2021 We happened to be in Corfu in one of the busiest holiday weeks and Villa Zoe was the perfect hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the island. The flat is beautifully situated in a small village in the mountains surrounded by pines  chirping crickets and nothing but nature. The terasse was an absolute sanctuary for breakfast  hour-long reading sessions and watching the sunset. The flat itself was much bigger than we expected from the picures and was furnished with everything one could need for a vacation (great kitchen equipment  coffee machine  air conditioning  etc.). Corfu town and the closest beaches can be reached in a 15-20 minutes drive and we did not mind the commute for the quiet and lovely accomodation in return. Vivian and Sal made us feel very welcome and always had the best restaurant recommendations (of which three are only a 5-minute drive away). We can highly recommend the Airbnb and hope to come back sometime!
903081,Viktoriya June 2021 Vivian and Sal are perfect hosts : welcoming  helpful and flexible. Vivian shared lots of places to visit and things to do. The house is in perfect state  nicely decorated  well equipped and very comfortable even for a long stay. Better than on photos. The central location allows visiting the whole island.  Few words about driving on Corfu. Be ready for narrow and steep two-way roads. Google maps do not distinguish between paved and unpaved roads. Sometimes a longer path with main roads can be easier and finally faster than taking shortcuts.  We found that Agios Gordios and Glifadas were the easiest to access among the nearest beaches. They are quite popular  but comfortable and beautiful. If you come before 9am or after 7pm  you can park easily and avoid crowds (end of June).
903081,William September 2020 We stayed at Viv and Sal's place for an entire month and loved it. They went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and the place is spacious. We will miss our morning routine of picking figs from the tree for our fruit salad with coffee on the balcony. Having a scooter or car is quite important for exploring the many beaches and sites all over Corfu and to get to town easily. Response from Vivian September 2020 You’re very welcome! We hope to see you again soon!
903081,Clara July 2020 The place was super nice and perfect to discover the island by car. Vivian gave us great tips on things to do in Corfu.
903081,Philip October 2019 Der Aufenthalt in der Villa Zoe war wundervoll. Das Appartment hat alles was man braucht und Vivian und Sal sind sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Wir wurden mit frischem Obst begrüßt und die zutraulichen Haustiere der beiden haben uns oft Freude bereitet. Die Insel mit ihrer traumhaften Natur und den tollen Stränden konnten wir von dem zentral gelegenen Appartment aus gut mit dem Mietwagen erkunden. Wir können Villa Zoe jedem wärmstens empfehlen.
903081,John September 2019 This is truly a lovely place to stay at in Corfu  away from the bustling coastal towns  yet central to reach all areas of the island by car. The villa is spotless and lacks for nothing. The lovely view from the patio/veranda looks over forest and towards distant mountains. Vivian and Sal are the perfect hosts. Their advice and generosity helped to make our stay a memorable one.
903081,Dimitris August 2019 Wonderful house in peace  great location  great space and facilities  very clean - anything you need for relaxed holiday! Vivian and his husband were always there to help us in anything we need and gave us great tips! Thanks for everything!
903081,David August 2019 Our home away from home… again This is not our first time at Sal&Viv’s place  nor is it likely to be the last. We hope to return for many years to come. It truly feels like a second home to us  and that makes it hard to describe all the myriad things why. It was perfect the last time  and they went and made it even better. Their hospitality and kindness is one of a kind  and I think so is the house. It is rare that we truly feel at home away from our home. I mentioned a lot of details in my last review  I think I will leave those our for now  if anyone is interested  just page down until you find it. The short version is that it is simply perfect. We've been travelling with kids for 6 years now  many times a year  and Sal&Viv's place is - in our view - the absolute best. Thanks guys again for a lovely time with the kids! We just left and all they nag us about is when we are going back :)
903081,Charlotte August 2019 If you are looking for a quiet retreat far off the busy spots of Corfu  this is your choice. A wonderful place with magical views over the hilly landscape  with mellow sunsets and bright mornings. Very comfortable and clean  modern amenities but still authentically integrating into the surroundings. Definitely need a car that can beat some tight and bumpy roads though! We’ll be back.
903081,Jessica July 2019 We chose Villa Zoe because it was ideally located close to family and our wedding venue. This place was our peaceful haven in the week leading up to our big day and we are so thankful to have had it. Vivian and Sal are wonderful hosts and we can't thank you enough for everything; you welcomed us in like family. Villa Zoe was very clean  comfortable and had lovely little homely touches and items which made us feel even more at home. We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay :-)
903081,Louise July 2019 Villa Zoe was a relaxing retreat  I would describe it as a real hidden gem .... outstanding hospitality with peaceful qualities as well as the home comforts personalised by Sal & Vivian.  I would recommend anyone that wants to try some plant based therapy to book in with Vivian she is highly qualified and knowledgeable in various holistic medicines.  I left feeling rejuvenated ....  I miss you guys hope to see you again soon if you will have me xxx  Blessings love and light to you all xxx
903081,Davide July 2019 We had a great time in Villa Zoe. The apartment is located in a beautiful landscape and you have a nice view from the balcony. You have everything you need in the flat. Vivian and Sal are such friendly and kind-hearted hosts. They gave us helpful recommendations for Restaurants and Trips. A car is necessary because the next bus stop is just too far away. We had a car accident and therefore we had to go to the police station to give a testimony. Vivian was immediately willing to come to the police station because a Greek person was needed as an agent. She helped us the whole day to solve the problem and served as intermediary. We were so grateful  and this deed has shown her good heart. Sal drove us without hesitation to the airport. We strongly recommend booking this apartment to meet these two lovely hosts.
903081,JoJo June 2019 What a wonderful stay! I cannot say how impressed I was with the hosts and with the apartment. I instantly relaxed in the beautiful spacious rooms and the view is exceptional. I can't get it out of my head!  Great location in the middle of Corfu also. Only 15 minutes drive to Corfu Old Town and we managed to visit North  South  East and West of the island within just a few days.  Highly recommend a visit and to benefit from the hosts' knowledge will guarantee the perfect break / holiday. I hope to be back soon!  My thanks to Vivian and Sal :)
903081,Sina June 2019 This Place is amazing. The Apartment was very clean and well equipped .Also it was very Quiet and the Beaches and the Central City were reachable By Car in 15-30 minutes.Vivian and her Husband are very friendly and warm hearted. We had a Great Time and will hopefully Return soon for a longer Stay.
903081,Susan April 2019 Vivian’s place meets all expectations for travelers wishing to explore the island. Not only is it affordable  it is clean and comfortable  quiet  and has stylish furnishings; and it has a relaxing atmosphere with wonderful views from the balcony. Vivian and Sal were great hosts  going that one step further to make us feel really welcome.
903081,Judith April 2019 Villa Zoe is a really nice  calm and peaceful place off the main tourist routes - a car or motorbike is good to get there though. The apartment has everything you need  it´s very nice  there are guide books including a nice hiking guide  the kitchen has everything you need including Oil  vinegar  spices and on arrival we found many fresh fruits waiting for us - very nice! Outside there´s a fireplace. Vivian and Sal are very friendly hosts and will help you with any question you might have. We can definitely recommend to stay at Villa Zoe.
903081,Martin October 2018 We had a great time at the comfy apartment of Vivian and Sal! When we arrived  fresh fruits awaited us. For our day trips around the island it was perfectly located in the center of Corfu up in the hills. We found everything we needed in the flat  including insider-tips from Vivian  on where to go. As parents  we where staying it the flat at evenings and were surprised when one evening a bottle of wine stood in front of our door :-) Thanks again! We felt very welcome and can recommend this place highly for anyone including families (there is also a washing machine  child seat  and all the other stuff children need). Response from Vivian October 2018 It was truly our pleasure  having you stay with us! We are so glad you had some time for you as well!
903081,Michael October 2018 we enjoyed our stay at Villa zoe! appreciated Sal's hospitality and suggestions for places to explore. we loved the peaceful setting.
903081,Yannick September 2018 Greate people  great location. I would totally do it again!
903081,David September 2018 Oh  where to begin! Everything about this place and its hosts is amazing. We came with two small kids and we'd like to move in with them permanently. A home away from home. Smack in the middle of the island  there isn't a single spot you cannot reach in 60 minutes. Sandy beaches in the south  glorious beauty in the north. Corfu is amazing and so is Vivian and Sal's place. They are the kindest  most fun people you will meet. They live next door and never get into your hair  but are always there when you need them. They have love-hungry dogs  but don't worry  you won't meet them if you don't want to. A bit hard to find the very first time  incredibly  there are no addresses in Corfu :) At least not in the hills where Viv and Sal live. Stunning view from the terrace  air conditioning in all rooms  strong wifi (albeit only on 5GHz  great with modern phones  tablets and laptops  but if you have an old computer you're out of luck). The place is really gorgeous  there everything you may wish for  everything looks new  nothing run down. Great bathroom  with a washing machine too. Just go. You'll love it. Response from Vivian September 2018 Thank you for your kind words! We adore the gifts you children gave us. We hope you do come back  it was truly wonderful having you stay with us!
903081,Boo July 2018 Wonderful place. Super clean  very comfy beds and spacious  light and bright. Incredible views too. Vivian welcomed us even though our flight was delayed by 3 and a half hours and we arrived at 1am. We had cold water and fruit waiting which was so thoughtful. Villa Zoe is in a great spot to explore the island. Vivian suggested a fabulous local beach  taverna and a boat tour. Highly recommended. Thanks Vivian and Sal x
903081,Rowan June 2018 This is a wonderful place with everything you could need. A great size with lovely balcony/terrace. A quiet spot if you want to get away from it all and avoid busy resorts. Just be prepared to drive as you can’t reach any beaches on foot. Vivian was always fantastically quick responding to enquiries and both she and Sal went over and above to make us feel welcome. It was wonderful getting to know Sal and mario over the course of the week! Thank you all for an excellent stay!! Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.
903081,Kirsten April 2018 Vivian and Sal really are “Super hosts”! We had a very warm welcome and they continued to make us feel at home during our stay. The accommodation was spacious  well equipped  spotless and very comfortable with a fantastic view from the balcony. The area is quiet with access to lovely walks. Close to traditional villages and some very good tavernas. We highly recommend this apartment and looking forward to returning there ourselves. Response from Vivian April 2018 Thank you! It was wonderful meeting you both!
903081,Ulrich April 2018 We were very happy with our trip to Corfu!
903081,Sue November 2017 The host canceled this reservation 184 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
903081,Inga October 2017 This is a wonderful quiet oasis in the middle of the island. From here you can easily discover Corfu by car and spend a calm evening on the terrace after an exciting day. We spend a super relaxed week in this beautiful apartment. Vivian and Sal are awesome hosts and provided us lovely recommendations. We discovered beautiful places  beaches and food! Again thank you so much! We definitely recommend this apartment and hope to come back one day!
903081,Ki September 2017 This was our second stay at Villa Zoe. We love it here! Anyone considering staying should rest assured they will have no regrets. A clean  cosy and homely place  located in the centre of the island in the scenic mountainous village of Kalafationes. While hiring a car/scooter would be advisable  this is a perfect base from which one could reach all parts of the island with ease. Vivian and Sal are a truly special couple  warm  welcoming and full of positive and inspiring energy that you can not help but feel drawn to. Clean air and nature surrounding  there is a definite feeling of peace and tranquility about their home. Stay here and soak it in  you are truly in for something special! :)
903081,Peter September 2017 Vivian and Sal are very good hosts and gave a us a lot of information about the surrounding area and good restaurants. We found the position of the house to be perfect for exploring the island and with easy access into Corfu town. The accommodation is very comfortable and we slept very well.
903081,Carina August 2017 Vivian and Sal really deserve the title as Superhosts! Their hospitality makes you feel welcome and at home from the very first minute! The appartement has everything you can ask for and is decorated with love and care! The place is situated in the mountains and perfect for everybody who looks for some peace and rest. Still the next beach as well as many other beautiful places worth a visit are just a stone throw away :) We'd really like to come back one day!
903081,Sue July 2017 This lovely Airbnb on the hill with super views will delight you. Vivian was a super host of note and assisted us with hiring a scooter to explore the quieter parts of Corfu . Kalafateoni the village nearby is a must to wander around and enjoy a drink in the picturesque little bar. The closest beaches are about 15-20 mins on the scooter . Or just relax on the patio outside the apartment and enjoy the view .
903081,Sophia June 2017 We had a lovely stay at Villa Zoe! It is the most picturesque setting on the mountainside and has everything you need for a great stay.. would highly recommend this spot to everyone. Response from Vivian June 2017 Thank you For staying with us at Villa Zoe!
903081,Ulli & Nora May 2017 Vivian and Sal are great hosts - super friendly  helpful and generous. The apartment is spacious  we loved the huge couch and the terrace with such a beautiful view. Here you find quit and peace :) same on the great roof top chill out zone. Enjoyed our stay very much  thank you again! Response from Vivian May 2017 We are so glad you enjoyed our new rooftop space and of course your stay here!
903081,Ki May 2017 A gem of a find! Such a special place to stay! Villa Zoe is situated in a quiet mountainous area of central Corfu - a perfect location by which one can easily reach all corners of the island  although is ideally suited to those who will have access to a car. You are in the nature here  far away from any crowds  with the freshest air we have ever experienced. Walking around the local area was truly special  while relaxing in the villa with the wide opening doors to the garden and mountain views was a treat in itself. Vivian and Sal are such a lovely couple - so warm and welcoming  and we felt at home right from the start. They have a good knowledge of the island and once they knew what appealed to us  gave us some great recommendations of places to go. The villa is clean  cosy and kitted out with all you could possibly need. Even better than the pictures would suggest  Villa Zoe is a perfect place to stay. We'll be back! :) Response from Vivian May 2017 Thank you so much for your kind words. It was truly a joy to have you both stay with us!
903081,Myrte May 2017 We've had a wonderful stay at Vivian and Sal's place! The location is superb  beautiful views all around  peaceful  and still close to the town and everything else on the island. The place is clean  big and feels like home. Fresh fruit and water on arrival was great! Vivian and Sal are so welcoming and generous  it was a pleasure to meet them! They gave us lots of great tips on what to do and where to eat. All in all  we can highly recommend this place and are hoping to return ourselves.
903081,Sharon April 2017 Vivian & Mario's place is located in the rolling hills with a beautiful view of the mountains in the distance. There are places in the area to stroll in nature and its an 8 min drive to our favorite bakery and an excellent home cooked Greek restaurant. The center was also an easy drive from their place. Their places is clean  kitchen is well equipped and the queen bed was comfortable (not too soft and not too hard).  They were genuine hosts and showed us many places on the island that were special.  I recommend V&M to anyone looking for a relaxing and low key get away. Corfu has a lot of beautiful beaches and hidden hikes to explore! Response from Vivian April 2017 We loved having you stay with us! It was really a treat to show you and Luka our natural treasures here in Corfu.
903081,Jolie April 2017 This place is such a hidden gem of Corfu. Vivian and her husband (Sal) are some of the best hosts and we felt welcome as soon as we arrived . The place was very comfortable  clean  spacious and the kitchen was very well equipped for what we need. The apartment is secluded as described ( not right next to the beach or close to the shops/regular public transport) so you will need to get a hire car but then this place is the best place to explore Corfu as it was in the middle of the island. Viv and Sal were very friendly  helpful and gave us loads of hints and tips for sightseeing  directions and local places. Fresh oranges from their garden and strawberries on arrival were big bonus too  they were natually sweet and so nice. We would definitely come back.  Be warned that the apartment is so relaxing that you may end up staying there most of the time. It was raining 2 days when we were there and we quite enjoyed sitting outside in the balcony most of the day thanks to the scenic view and lovely company (Viv's dogs and cat). Response from Vivian April 2017 Thank you so much for staying with us and for your kind words. We are so happy you were able to relax and recharge. Wishing you all the best!
903081,Nick September 2016 Viv and Sal were very welcoming and always helpful with recommendations getting around Corfu and making the most of our time there. The location had great views and sunny all day around. Overall had a relaxing time and happy we chose this place.
903081,Augustin August 2016 Vivian and Sal were wonderful hosts  helpful and discret at the same time ! The appartment is really confortable  perfect for a couple ! Thank you again  i'll definitly come back there when in Corfu ! Response from Vivian August 2016 Thank you for choosing to stay with us!
903081,Davide August 2016 Vivian and Sal have been just perfect. They truly love their house and you will fall in love with it too  that's for sure! The retreet is on the top of a quiet hill in the very middle of the island  it's a perfect home-base to visit all Corfu's beaches. The apartment is amazing  cozy and clean. Honestly  our best Airbnb experience ever! Response from Vivian August 2016 Thank you for the wonderful carbonara and the wonderful company!
903081,Sophie August 2016 I highly recommend Vivian place. From the reservation to the arrival  the experience was great. We were warmly welcome by Vivian and her husband Sal  they immediately took time to share all the tips and the best addresses of the neighboorhood. Then we really enjoy the flat  a lot of space  this is very clean and very well equiped. Finally a last word for the very peaceful view  this is wonderful !! Response from Vivian August 2016 Thank you for staying with us!
903081,Matthew July 2016 A fantastic few days away in a beautiful location away from the main tourist areas of a wonderful island but close enough to drive in each night for something to eat and drink.  The villa was just perfect for our requirements  easily accommodating 3 in comfort with all the facilities anyone would need.  The host and her husband Sal were wonderful throughout  meeting us at the airport  talking us through the best places to visit each day and always being around to ask questions of and give advice  you couldn't ask for a nicer couple as your air b n b hosts  thoroughly recommended! Response from Vivian July 2016 Thank you for staying with us!
903081,Lia July 2016 Vivian was amazing! We got a bit lost on the way to the apartment with our rented car and she was available and came to show us the way. The place is beautiful and has everything you need. Vivian gave us great recommendations of good restaurants and things to do. We enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend it :)
903081,Thibault July 2016 Our stay at Vivian and Sal's place was absolutely wonderful ! The location is perfect  at the top of the hill  with nature everywhere in the surroundings. The place itself was very nice  with the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in ! The living room is spacious and the bedroom is cosy. There's climatisation in both rooms  which makes the place nice and cool whenever it's really hot outside. There's also a balcony where you can relax and enjoy the view and the sun. About the hosts themselves  they were delightful. Vivian had to go and work in Athens but Sal would give us tips on where to go and what was nice to see. They lender us their GPS too. Icing on the cake  we went out for dinner on the last evening  after Vivian came back  and it was very enjoyable. Had a chat until late in the evening and got the chance to know them better. Overall  fantastic experience  and I would go back anytime ! Thank you so much !
903081,Judy July 2016 Fantastic place area and hosts. Always helpful with great recommendations and assistance. I could live here. I truly felt like I was visiting friends.
903081,Soeren June 2016 Best Airbnb stay ever. Vivian and her husband Sal own a very nice house in the backcountry. They live next door but you still have your privacy. The apartment is new and very stylish. It's very good located (15 min to the beach and to Corfu town) and situated in an authentic cordial village. If you wanna stay away from the main tourist tracks this is the right place. They provided us with a lot of hints and suggestions which places  restaurants and beaches we should check out. On top they helped us a lot when I lost my wallet and we ran out of documents and money. They are amazing people and we would definitely come back.
903081,Donal May 2016 Beautiful location  great people and amazing nature all around. Corfu has lush vegetation due to the mix of heat  sun and rain that it gets throughout the year and this place offers a great view from up on high. We were there in late April and the fire flies were out  which was amazing at night to look down on them from the balcony. The hosts were extremely friendly  good people who invited us over for drinks and local made ice-cream one of the nights! Its also right in the centre of the island and about 15 mins from the town by car so  it is pretty well situated to visit the island by car. Great experience overall - highly recommended! Response from Vivian May 2016 It was wonderful to have you stay with us. We look forward to hopefully seeing you again in the future.
903081,Suzy En Anthony October 2015 We had a lovely time at Vila Zoe. The appartement is spacious  clean and nicely decorated. The view is beautiful. The location is good  about 15 min from Corfu City in the middle of the Island. From there we could explore Corfu. Shops are not far  but a car or motorcycle is needed to get there. Vivian and Sal where very welcoming and helped us out to find the good restaurants and nice places to go. We had a lovely stay and would love to come back. Anthony and Suzy Response from Vivian October 2015 It was such a pleasure to have you stay with us! Thank you for the wine  it was very thoughtful! Many Blessings  Vivian and Sal Show more
903081,Christine September 2015 Beautiful apartment  very spacious and with a nice terrace and view. It is very well equipped  so our stay was very comfortable. Moreover sal and his pets made as really feel home and our stay such a nice experience  we didn't want to leave. We highly recommend staying there and next time on Corfu we will book for sure.
903081,Michelle August 2015 We are just back home from our stay with Vivian and Sal and it was wonderful. Villa Zoe is beautiful  on a perfect location to explore the island. Vivian and Sa were very nice  they went all the way to make us feel welcome. They offered to pick us up on the airport and lend us their gps system for the week. We were extremely happy that we made the choice to stay with them  it made our vacation a fantastic one. The apartment is better then the pictures  beautiful bathroom and functiona kitchen. There was air conditioning in the bedroom as well. We loved this place and will sure visit Villa Zoe again in the future. Thank you Viv and Sal for this great experience! Response from Vivian August 2015 We really enjoyed your enthusiasm for this beautiful island. It was also nice to hear about your adventures. Sorry about the wifi signal  we will see how we can make it better.
903081,Kristine July 2015 Very friendly and nice hosts! Very nice apartment! Minor room for improvement: Very hot outside during our stay  and the air condition was in the living room (and the bedroom remained quite hot). Response from Vivian August 2015 We're so sorry it was so hot during your stay. It has been the hottest summer in eight years. We took your suggestion and put an air conditioner in the bedroom as well. Next time you come  the bedroom will be nice and cool! We hope to see you again  hopefully for a longer stay. Many blessings  Vivian and Sal Menjivar Show more
903081,Suze July 2015 The property was amazing  big comfy bed  great sofa and lovely balcony. Also there was all the things we needed for cooking. The location was fab for exploring the island but you do need a car. Viv and Sal were great with advice of what to visit and also what not to bother with - even lending us their Sat nav! Would definatkey reccomend and we would love to come again! Response from Vivian July 2015 Thank you! We loved having you both stay with us!
903081,Aleksandar April 2015 Vivian and Sal house is wonderful  located in the beautiful village of Kalafationes. The area is wonderful  people were friendly and have a great sense of hospitality. If you want to visit the island  this is the best place i can think of. Vivian and Sal are really cool  helpful and discrete. The place is clean  roomy and elegant. Apartment looked better than the photos. It was truly unique! Response from Vivian May 2015 Thank you! You and your family were wonderful! We were sad to see you go!
903081,Mirjam October 2014 Villa Zoe is a very nice and large appartement with an open living room and kitchen  an extra bedroom and a bathroom. In the appartment everything we needed was available (even more). The balcony is also very nice with sun and a nice view through the valley. The area is very quiet and perfect for those who do not want to share their holidays with many other tourists. A car is needed to get there  but since it is in the middle of the island it is perfect to go anywhere you want. Vivian and Sal were very nice  friendliy and warm hosts. Sal catches us at the airport and in the appartment they provided us fresh water and fruits. We could ask them for many advices where to go  they were very helpful. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay at Korfu. Thank you very much for the nice vacation - we immediately felt like home!
903081,Johanna October 2014 We had a great time at Villa Zoe and in Corfu! The apartment is very spacious and well equipped with everything that you would need if you were self-catering  eg. a cooker  fridge  washing machine. A lovely balcony to sit and enjoy the stunning vistas. The apartment is in a great location - right in the centre of the island for those who drive  as well as being a short distance from Corfu town with its bus connections to other areas. Moreover  there are a number of beautiful walking trails nearby. As for the hosts themselves  they couldn't have been more welcoming and hospitable. Viv and Sal have good local knowledge and are extremely helpful  attentive people. We had fresh fruit and water on arrival which was exactly what we needed after arriving on a late flight. We started our holiday here and didn't think twice about rebooking for our final night.
903081,Keilla & Paul September 2014 Vivian met us at the airport  late at night to take us up to her place  and explained everything to us very well. Both her and her husband were more than accommodating and went out of their way to help us and show us places to go and see. The place is clean and bigger than we expected  with the location far from the touristy busyness. Just don't forget to have cash in the area and you definitely need a car.
903081,Katerina August 2014 Vivian and Sal where great hosts! the house is actually much nicer in reality and spacious enough to host 3-4 adults. The view from the balcony was relaxing and when the wind blows it is very pleasant. i totally recommend this place as it is also located conveniently close to Corfu town and the most well known beaches!  many thanks and love to Vivian and Sal! Hope we see them again!
903081,Anton August 2014 Villa Zoe situated in a village apart from the resort rush and makes an excellent choice for those travelers who seek quiet place to relax after exploration of Corfu. Thanks to light breeze which always blows over the mountain staying there is pleasant all the time even if it is heat in the lowlands. As it is situated in the middle of the island you can choose between beaches of the both shores. It takes 10-15 min by car to get to the best beaches. The car is a must but it is a must anyway when you are on Corfu because there is a plenty places to see except the beaches. I find boring visiting the same beach everyday and on Corfu it worth visiting different beaches. The hosts are welcoming and friendly trying to help us with everything they could even in very unusual and unexpected situations. We are a family with three children from 4 to 17 years old so our ‘unexpected situations’ were indeed different and unexpected  Thank you Vivian and Sal!
903081,Sona October 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Vivian & Sal's place. The apartment is superbly equipped with everything you need. As a welcome  there were a few delicacies from the area  which we were very pleased about. The house is super quiet and you can reach all destinations (city  restaurants  city  shopping) in no time. Vivian & Sal are both incredibly loving and accommodating hosts. We would come back any time Translated from German  Show original
903081,Angelina June 2022 We had a great time in the lovingly furnished apartment in the countryside! The apartment offers everything you want for a vacation (e.g. parasol  beach towels  candles for the terrace  even Netflix for relaxing evenings  etc.). From the apartment you can get anywhere in Corfu quickly by rental car. The nearest beaches can be reached in 15-20 minutes by car. However  we liked to sit on the terrace in the evening with a bottle of wine and enjoyed the sunset. The host was very warm and was able to give us great tips. We only recommend it!! Translated from German  Show original
903081,Fam May 2022 A spacious  simple but comfortable apartment in a beautiful area. Welcoming reception by the very helpful Vivian and Salvador. They're always there for you with great tips. For groceries  restaurants and terraces  you are especially at Corfu city (15 km). Recommended: dinner in the only restaurant of Kalafationes  unfortunately not always open. Translated from Dutch  Show original
903081,Sandrine August 2021 Vivian and Sal's house is very well decorated   very nice  it feels like home and we loved its location in the middle of the mountains but close to a lot to see on the island . It is also a Zen and relaxing place. We wish we could have stayed longer . Vivian and Sal are very friendly   it was very nice and nice to talk with them . They are also very available and accommodating . We can only encourage you to go and stay there. If we have the opportunity to return to Corfu we will go back to their place!

903081,Per October 2018 We highly recommend visiting worldly AirBnb hosts Vivian & Sal and their friendly pets. Located in the middle of nature with idyllic views  we enjoyed breakfast on the terrace every morning overlooking the distance. We had a wonderful week with our little daughter (20 months). Thanks for the spontaneously secured bed gates - this has made it even easier to travel with toddler on the plane 😊 We felt like we were visiting friends for a chat - that's how we enjoy AirBnb. Translated from German  Show original
903081,Anette August 2018 Vivian and her husband were very nice and helpful. We were very satisfied with the accommodation as a starting point for our island exploration with the rental car.

903081,Christina August 2017 The apartment was very spacious and equipped with everything you need. Vivian is very friendly and helpful and even picked us up from the port. The property is well located if you have a car. This is definitely necessary as the bus stop is 4 km away. Translated from German  Show original

903081,Kathi June 2017 Vivian and Sal's apartment is a beautiful place to unwind. It is generously sized and equipped with everything you need for a relaxing vacation. Due to the perfect central location  every direction of the island can be reached easily and quickly by car (airport about 15 minutes  nearest beach about 10 minutes). The hosts are super nice  helpful and speak English fluently. Due to the fact that the two live right next door  you can always get tips for e.g. good restaurants or beautiful beaches. We really enjoyed our time in Corfu and would recommend Vivian and Sal's place to anyone!

Its location  in the center of the island  makes it easy and quick to connect all the points of interest you want (and there are many). Photos are accurate  and the space has all the useful and necessary amenities. Sal & Vivian are warm  welcoming  available and always willing to help you. They will love lovers of beautiful culinary discoveries and places away from the tourist spots. You can only have a good time at their place. For those who are afraid they have dogs  don't worry  they are very well behaved and can't bother you.  In short  a great experience! We will not hesitate to rent this accommodation again on a future visit to Corfu!! Translated from French  Show original

19763107,Mark August 2022 We LOVED our stay in this apartment! It was so spacious and welcoming  and most importantly  we felt right at home. Maria and her team did a wonderful job quickly preparing the apartment for us on short notice  and it was impeccably clean. We enjoyed the 3 balconies  very cool air conditioning in the bedrooms  and very fast internet connection. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking  and very spacious. I would give this apartment 6 stars if I could. Thanks again for being such great hosts! I will recommend you to friends and colleagues 😁
19763107,Sophia August 2018 We had a perfect time there. The island is breathtaking and Maria was a lovely host. Always there if needed and a wonderful - energetic person. We definitely recommend this place. If you do have a car it is the perfect place to be  since it is located in the middle of the island. Thank you Maria!
19763107,Robert May 2018 Amazing vacation
19763107,Marina August 2017 We had a wonderful stay in Maria’s house. She is a very hospitable host and very pleasant person. She promptly responded our requests and prepared a nice welcoming present to our arriving. House is fully new and placing very convenient for travelling all over the island. It’s not on walking distance form beaches  but all information is shown on site. If you rent a car  this is not a problem at all. We do recommend it for staying with friends or with family.

20613125,Rebecca October 2022 We cannot recommend this place enough - we had the best holiday at Kamaritis! The room was clean  comfortable and equipped with everything you could need. Eleni was very quick and efficient with communication and check-in was so easy. The whole family was so welcoming and helpful to us. A highlight of each morning was wandering into the outdoor kitchen area to find Maria's amazing Greek delicacies left as a surprise - it was some of the best Greek food we tried whilst on Corfu! The location was very central and a perfect base for exploring the island by hire car (we'd recommend this mode of transport if you want to explore lots of the island in a short time). Kamaritis is a little paradise - we'd love to come back one day!
20613125,"Meryem September 2022 Let me begin with saying  the contact we had in person was nice and they tried to help us. The people are friendly and I like to think they mean well.  However we didn't experiences are stay as pleasant as we hoped. Specially for the amount we paid  we where expecting more. When we arrive a couple of bookshelf's came down (hanging above are heads where we are sleeping) because they weren't installed properly and there was barely any wifi. After the complains we found out they where already aware of this but didn't inform us about the situation. After 2 days we managed to get a better connection  because of a different wifi they gave us afterwards. Later that week we didn't had any warm water  gladly that was solved in 2 days  but again.. the contact about the situation wasn't ideal. Also there are a lot of wesp and hornets. They can't do anything about this  but not ideal when you wan to swim in the pool or relax in the garden.  So in short. When you want to stay local and don't mind the insects or not being guaranteed that you can reach people over the internet  yes. It is your place to be. The people are friendly and will take good care of you. But if you are looking for any sorts of luxury  then I wouldn't recommend it. Show more Response from Eleni September 2022 It is really sad that you had such a bad time in our house Mereym. It is really sad too that there is not enough space to copy paste those angry messages you where sending me on a Sunday morning regarding the connection problem with the wifi  which by the way turned out to be from your phone  since when my brother rebooted your device it worked just fine. It is really sad too that I can't copy paste your sorry messages about your behavior  when you entered my brother's house where he lives with his wife and two small children without a notice very angry searching for me in a mad state. It is really sad that you didn't take a moment to read that I specifically write on my listing about how remote the house is and in the nature. It has wasps and dogs and cats and sometimes ants  but it is a house in the woods and some people enjoy that greatly. It is really sad lastly that you paid those money and when I told you that I asked from airbnb to find you a different accommodation and to give you your money back for the rest of your stay  after the mad state that you were because of the ""wifi problem ""  you were crying on the phone asking me to forgive you and that you didn't want to leave the house because you felt how nice and helpful people we are. It is generally really sad... Show more"
20613125,Frauke September 2022 This was one of the most wonderful stays I ever got to experience! Elenis family is made of wonderful people who are very kind and Maria's breakfast treats were an absolute highlight! The location is wonderful with the cozy apartment and the beautiful outdoor kitchen along with the pool! For exploring the island this location is also perfect  you never need a big amount of time to go anywhere! This airbnb is an absolute gem and I recommend it wholeheartedly! Definitely want to come back! 💞
20613125,Stefan August 2022 Gorgeous place! Lovely homecooked food available too. Would highly recommend getting the breakfast/diner. We ended up having our daily breakfast here every day.  Perfect location. A little tricky to drive if you have not much experience with driving on hills.
20613125,Frank July 2022 More than a superhost. Unforgetable...
20613125,"Julia July 2022 We have had such a pleasant time at Eleni's place. Her family is very kind and lovely and provided everything we needed. They even gave us a little farewell present. Their little dog ""Schnitzel"" is also very cute. The location itself is really peaceful and idyllic (just make sure you have a vehicle to move around the island).  We will definitely come back!"
20613125,Tina June 2022 Incredible hosts! We had such a lovely time in the area of the small town Kamara. The Villa Kamaritis is one of the best airbnbs we have ever been. Maria provided us with delicious food and fruits from the garden. We felt really welcomed by the whole family who are living also in the Villa. We had a private entrance and a cute small balcony for ourself. The kitchen was right next to the pool so we had a wonderful view to the surrounding mountains at dinner.
20613125,Jessica June 2022 If I could give this Airbnb 10 stars  I would! Don't try and find a better place  you won't. The views  the pool  the outdoor kitchen  the cutest dog ever  the delicious food Maria (the grandma) prepares  the hospitality. It can't be beat!
20613125,Peter June 2022 As we arrived to the house we felt like coming into paradise. We liked the beautiful garden  the pool and most of all the hospitality of the family. Every morning we looked forward for the amazing and delicious food from Maria. We also loved the fruits from the garden! The enjoyment of life they spread is priceless!
20613125,Nadja April 2022 Eleni's place was one of the best air bnb experiences we made so far. The house is beautifully located in the mountains with just a short drive to corfu city or the beach. The room and the pool are very clean and beautifully decorated. But what makes this place really special is the family. Their hospitailty is so wonderful. Nikos and Eleni support you with every help you can think of and Eleni's mother Maria surprised us everyday with the most delicious treats. She even asked for allergies and as I am lactose-intolerant she thought of greek dishes that I can eat. We highly recommend this place!
20613125,Lena October 2021 Eleni and her family welcomed us like friends  they did everything to make us feel home. Everyday there would be little surprise dishes from Maria (Elenis Mother)  which were the best! Elenis Guidebook gave us the best inspiration for food and places to visit  you can rely on her recommendation for sure! Even if part of the family is living on the property  there is no need to feel limited. You should definitely rent a car or a scooter  as the accommodation is quite remote  but that is also part of its charm. It is definitely worth coming here to relax and meet great people!
20613125,Corinna October 2021 This was one of my best Airbnb experiences ever! We felt very welcome by Eleni and her family  who took us in like we were a part of it. The house is nice with a beautiful pool area. While Nikos was there for any question  Maria surprised us every day with her tasty food. We definitely want to come back here when we visit Korfu again. Benny&Corinna
20613125,Paula October 2021 Dear Maria  Nikos and Eleni  Thank you so much for the hospitality  we felt like we were at home! You have a wonderful place  everything is perfect to make us feel special. All the details make the difference  we can tell that you care about your guests. Our room was very cosy  super clean  with a private balcony with pool view  complimentary fruits and water  the bathroom have the amenities as well. Sweet Maria was like a mommy  spoiling us with her delicious food and kindness! We wish we could stay more days  but definitely  if we come back to Corfu  Kamaratis is the perfect place to stay  close to Corfu town and a good place to explore the island. Don't change anything  everything was absolutely perfect! We wish you all the best for your family  and hope to visit you soon 😊. With love Paula & Rui
20613125,Lesley September 2021 We just left a few hours ago  but already miss the place! Before arriving Eleni helped us with preparing the trip  which made us feel very relaxing about coming to Corfu! After we arrived  we emediatly felt like home with the kindness from all the family! The appartment was very clean and the outdoor kitchen was perfect to be outside till late in the evening. The environment was amazing with a great pool and Maria surprised us all the time with her amazing food. We couldnt hope for a better place to stay! For the ones who are not sure yet: defenitly go! You wont regret it :) When back in Corfu  you see us again! Lots of love  Robert en Lesley
20613125,Flora-Lena September 2021 Eleni  Maria and Nikos made our stay very special  they were so caring and always helped us out. It is a beautiful house and property and the view is amazing! We have never felt so welcome in an AirBnB before. Maria is a wonderful cook and surprised us with great food :) We would definitely recommend it  it was one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve been to!
20613125,Jona August 2021 Our stay at Kamaritis was one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had so far. Eleni and her family make you feel welcome and at home from the moment you arrive. Everything is super clean  the pool is huge and has enough umbrellas around to escape the sun. We enjoyed the quietness  the fruit from the garden and Maria‘s delicious breakfast surprises. Kamaritis is located perfectly in the middle of Corfu and you can easily reach the beaches with your car. We definitely recommend staying here!
20613125,Tim July 2021 Perfect location and room. We really enjoyed a couple of days here and would recommend this place to anybody! Eleni and her parents are wonderful hosts. Thanks again!
20613125,Jannik July 2021 We loved every aspect of the accommodation: the location was away from the tourist hotspots but literally next to the Korfu trail in beautiful surroundings and well connected to the whole island by road  Eleni‘s family living next door was extremely kind & even made some snacks for us during our stay while still ensuring we had all the privacy we wanted  and the apartment itself had everything we needed for a nice stay. We would more than recommend this accommodation!
20613125,Katia July 2021 This is not just an AirBnB. It is a Family B&B. It is a home away from home. Cuddling in the small village of Kamara  surrounded by lush greenery  is the beautiful  cozy and welcoming home of Eleni and her family. The place to choose for your stay on Corfu Island if you are looking for a quiet house with a luxurious homy touch and a large swimming pool  away from the crowd  away from the noise and the city lights. And this is why we chose it for a second year in a roll  keeping in mind that we never repeat a destination or an accommodation place because we love diversity.  The surprise breakfast every morning on the table will make you feel like your mom secretly sneeked in and left you a homemade plate of pancakes with jam or marble cake. It will warm your heart and give you the boost of positive energy to start your day.  And being almost in the middle of the best part of the island will allow you to visit a different beach every day of your vacation. And the beached on Corfu are breathtaking! With their azure waters and beautiful fish  you would wish you'd booked a longer stay to be able to visit more beaches.  Once again  thank you  Eleni and fam for this memorable and exciting vacation at your home 💖 We'd always come to Kamaritis when on Corfu.  Eleni  thank you for Show more
20613125,Kevin July 2021 You are looking for a great accommodation for your stay at corfu? Stop searching you already found the best place. The house is in the best location very quite  close to everything and close to corfu and the airport and in the middle of the island. If you would like to discover the island its the best place including great tips from eleni. We had an amazing time at the house of eleni and the family. From arrival to departure it was just the best experience there is nothing which could be better. We even got the chance from maria to try the best homemade greece food. The family is so cute and very welcoming with a big heart.You will definitely not regret if you stay there. We are definitely coming back
20613125,Susan June 2021 I spend 11 days here and I had wonderful time at Kamaritis and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a laid-back time away from the hectic pace of the world. It‘s located in the outback in a small scenic village surrounded bis cypress hills. The view from the villa is absolutely picturesque. I explored almost the whole island from here  it is perfectly located in the centre to go in every direction. Sophia and Nikolas  Elenis parents  live at the Villa. They are very friendly people who respect privacy and are always there to help and make the stay as comfortable as possible. Sophias cookings are great  she always makes sure you are not hungry and puts a breakfast suprise at the table every morning. The communication with Eleni was perfect  she always answered instantly. I felt very welcomed at this place and would always come back.
20613125,Cosme May 2021 The house is wonderful: surrounded by nature and majestic cypresses  silent and in a 10-house village. The pool area has a kitchen that allows to spend the whole day there chilling. Eleni’s family knows exactly how to balance between being extremely nice and warm hosts (amazing dishes by Granny Maria and seasonal fruits from their garden included) and discreetly leaving the guest at their own pace  We will definitely come back if we have the chance!
20613125,Julia September 2020 The stay at Kamaritis exceeded our expectations. It is a beautiful place that Eleni and her family make an unforgettable experience. We would definitely come back and recommend this place to everyone.
20613125,Agnieszka August 2020 Eleni ! We would like to thank you very much for your kindness and good heart. For your help before we arrived ;) and your support when we were here. ❤️ We will never forget every day surprises from Maria which were absolutely perfect! Without Nicolas we would be totally lost :) thank you for teaching us how to eat figs straight from the tree!! I’m sure we will come back whole family!
20613125,"Franziska October 2019 We stayed at Kamaritis for two weeks and we felt so at home! We were welcomed with a Greek Salad and some wine after a long day of traveling. You definitely need a car or a scooter to get around  then you can explore all the nice beaches and villages around. We spent our days relaxing at the poolside or driving to our favorite beaches ""Agios Gordios"" or ""Halikounas"". It was a perfect stay!"
20613125,Romain October 2019 A must ! Welcome in Kamaritis was very warm. Our stay was wonderful  we were touched by the attentions of Elini’s parents throughout the week. Breakfast everyday was amazing. We had the chance to taste traditional dishes cooked with passion  we felt at home ! The accommodation is very well located on the island  not so far from Corfu and close to the most beautiful part of the coast. We had a great time here  enjoyed the beautiful swimming pool.
20613125,Michał September 2019 The single best host on Corfu island. Beautiful scenery of local fruit trees and natural wonders accompanied by delicious  genuine Greek food. Kamaritis is also located in great spot to visit all of Corfu's marvelous locations. Still the most important are lovely  helpful people that welcomed us in this nicest place to rest and simply be.
20613125,Eiko September 2019 Yes  it's all true  what previous comments say!
20613125,Carolina September 2019 The best stay we had on our week in Corfu. Maria makes the best breakfeast in town! The property is beautifull and they make sure you feel at home. Highly recommend if you want a quiet place to stay with an incredible pool and view!
20613125,Nadama August 2019 Our host waited for us to arrive as we were running later than expected. She greeted us and had already had a light arrival snack prepared for us and even some of their own wine which was very good ! Don’t know if this was standard fare but it was much appreciated as we were hungry and tired.  As for the place - beautiful  peaceful  idealic setting with lovely pool and friendly family atmosphere.
20613125,Stefan August 2019 Our Stay at Eleni's Kamaritis was the best air bnb that we ever experienced.  Eleni and her family took very good care of us. They are lovely people who take great interest in their guests well-being (especially Maria  the grandmother  who was introducing us to very delicoous home-made Greek dishes! THANK YOU again Maria we already miss and your food).  The apartment was very clean and we were given everything we needed (towels  blankets  shampoo  etc.). The large pool is a highlight  which we enjoyed all morning before we drove to the nearby beach (Agios Gordios - the most beautiful beach in Korfu)  We recommend Eleni's place 100% (which we already have to our family and friends) and we recommend it to you if you plan to spend a nice  quiet and authentic Greek holiday in Korfu. We will definitely visit Eleni's place again! Show more
20613125,Patsy July 2019 A beautifully quiet spot - handy to get around from here. Set in a quaint wee village close to Corfu township.  Nikolas and Maria were amazing  genuine people. Very warm and welcoming.  We were treated to breakfast every morning from Maria who is an outstanding  authentic cook. Presentation was perfect and it was so nice to chill and relax in the beautiful pool at the end of the day.
20613125,Isabelle July 2019 We had an amazing stay at the house of Eleni's parents. The kindness and hospitality of the family made us feel right at home. When we arrived we were welcomed with great food and home made wine  which was a real treat.  The house is situated in a beautiful area  surrounded by nature. It is a prefect place to relax and enjoy the island. There is also a small village within walking distance that has to nice restaurants to visit.  In the end it was the family that made our stay really special. We were spoiled every day with an amazing breakfast and fresh fruits from the garden. We highly recommend the place!
20613125,Lisa July 2019 We had a great time at the house of Eleni and her parents. They welcomed us very kindly and provided us with a tasty breakfast and gave us the feeling of always being there for us.  The house is very pretty and the pool is awesome. You can sit at your own small balcony with having a great view over the garden and pool! Mostly we were there by ourselves but also when the two girls of Eleni or her nephew were playing in the pool  we felt very welcomed and they are very sweet  respectful and they first asked us if it’s ok for us. They almost gave us the feeling that we are part of their family. the whole property was very well maintained and clean. You can sit around the pool and have your breakfast there!  The room is a bit small but very tidy and nicely decorated and the bed was very comfortable! Also the bathroom is nice and new. There was even water and two beer in the fridge and the parents of Eleni (she was at work) welcomed us with a Glas of juice and some Greek yoghurt. We felt all the time very very welcomed and had our own privacy at the same time! Perfect!  The town is very small and hidden in the mountains. You don’t have supermarkets or restaurants there but there are some only 10 minutes away by car. The advantage is totally having such a peaceful view: you look straight into the hills and green trees  so you are surrounded by nature. This gem totally is the right decision if you search for a quiet and isolated but also positive place to stay! This was exactly what we were looking for. Is you have your own car you can reach almost every spot and nice beach within 45 minutes. Perfect! It was a pleasure to come back in the evenings after our day trips to this beautiful place and having a dip into the pool before going to bed.  We felt very relaxed only after a few hours.  Thanks Eleni + parents:)  Hopefully see you again!

Don’t hesitate to book a stay here  it’s the best!
20613125,Tanja June 2019 Eleni and her parents were so friendly and sweet. We really liked to stay there. The breakfast was just awesome! The area is beautiful and quite. We hope to see you all soon :)
20613125,Oliver May 2019 Perfect place for people who like a quiet and rural environment and who appreciate the possibility to be in close contact with a very nice and intelligent greek family. Possible downside: for the next cafe  restaurant or shopping option you need to travel around 10 minutes by car. Response from Eleni May 2019 Thank you Oliver for your kind words. Just to clarify  if we want to be precise  that the nearest taverna or Cafe is only two minutes drive - 10min walk - from the house. Nevertheless  thank you again for the opportunity to meet with you and your lovely wife. Show more
20613125,Michael May 2019 It was a wonderful time at Kamaritis. Maria  Eleni  and Niko welcomed us warmly. Breakfast was made with love and everyday something special.
20613125,Sally September 2018 The best holiday ever in Corfu with the kindest family. The welcome from Nikos and Maria with a homemade meal and wine was amazing. The room is so cosy with a comfortable bed ensuring a peaceful sleep listening to the owls. Breakfast was a feast lovingly prepared and presented by Maria. After a day on the beach we enjoyed a swim in the pool together with a tray of local tea  fruit and homemade cakes. We would rate this Airbnb as exceptional and hope to return.
20613125,Silke September 2018 Five stars  we just don't have the words. Simply the best!  Eleni  Maria and Nicos do everything they can to make your stay as familiar as possible. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of the capital  you will be rewarded with a dreamlike environment and a lovingly furnished room. From the pool  one has an impressive view to the mountains and one seriously considers if one wants to postpone the day trip to tomorrow...  We say thank you for 3 unforgettable days.
20613125,Andreea September 2018 Hello! Our experience at Eleni's house was amazing! My husband and I stayed at Eleni's villa for one week  being our first time in Corfu. The whole experience was simply beautiful - the house is placed in the in the small village of Kamara  surrounded by nature. The property is very well maintained by Eleni's parents  Nikos and Maria  who were so warm and nice to us. Maria made us breakfast every morning  though we didn't book it or ask for it  and Nikos was very nice to help us with every need we had (he's a very good English speaker!).  The property has a big pool where you can relax if you're tired of going to the beach - we did this one morning and was so relaxing  playing in the entire pool and drinking our coffee in the sun afterward. Our room was very comfortable and clean with a romantic touch. It also had a small balcony where we had breakfast and coffee each morning. We loved the stillness of the place - in the night everything was so quiet and you could hear different sounds of birds singing from afar.  If you love nature and you're looking for a place to relax and be far from the noisy small towns of Corfu  the Kamarits villa is the perfect place. Though  is recommended to have a car or a motorbike to travel to the property because is placed in the mountains  about half an hour from Corfu Town and 15-20 minutes from Agios Gordios  the nearest town. We traveled each day to a different beach  mostly in the West part of the island where is quieter than on the East (also  the beaches here are large and sandy). The average time to the beach is around half an hour by car. If you'd like to taste the fuss of the city  Corfu Town is your best option  but Eleni recommended us some taverns in the villages near Kamara (one of them was great actually).  Our holiday is ended  but looking back we are so grateful because we've found the idyllic Kamaritis villa in the mountains of Corfu island.  Thank you  Eleni and your family for being our hosts!

20613125,Déborah August 2018 What to say about Eleni’s place? It is the best Airbnb I’ve ever been in. Everything is perfect. Eleni is lovely and very helpful  she picked us up and dropped us in the center of Corfu with her car and helped us to rent a scooter. Eleni’s mother will make sure your stay at the house is perfect and will always offer something to eat or drink. Breakfasts are amazing! The location is great  very central on the island so nowhere is too fat away. The house is in a small village in the middle of the nature  a haven of peace and quiet  far away from the agitation of the city  a piece of heaven! This means you will definitely need a car or a scooter to travel around the island from the house  but it’s definitely worth doing it! Do not hesitate for a minute  book this place!
20613125,Luke August 2018 Our 5 day break in Kamara was absolutely fantastic. Eleni and her family made us feel so welcome in their home! The hospitality we received far exceeded our expectation and would have no hesitation in recommending this Airbnb to our friends or family. The pool is fantastic  the scenery breathtaking and the food as local and delicious as it come.
20613125,Peter July 2018 We stayed for 7 nights in the B&B from Eleni and her family. The room is comfortable and very clean. The surrounding of the house is beautyfull and quiet. We really loved the swimming pool during the hot days.  In end was it the hospitality of Eleni and her family that makes our stay really special! Thank you for that!  All together we highly recommend this place!!
20613125,Eve July 2018 Probably the best AirBnb we have ever stayed in! Eleni and her family were so accommodating and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and relaxed. We would highly recommend visiting Eleni’s home and can not fault anything! A beautiful home and location!
20613125,Kari July 2018 100% Stay here. If this is available for your vacation or stay book it now.  You will experience amazing hospitality  delicious Greek food  and a wonderful loving family.  Best Regards  Kari Rovala
20613125,Tabea July 2018 The accommodation is fantastic! We were received by the whole family very lovable and immediately felt very comfortable. The room is very clean and the bathroom is beautiful. From the room you can look at the beautiful pool  which is surrounded by beautiful nature. Every morning Maria (Eleni's mother) has prepared the best breakfast in the world. The whole family is so friendly and has been amazing. If you have a question you can always ask them. The last evening  they prepared a barbecue with traditional Greek food and have invited us to eat with them. They made our trip perfect and we really want to come back soon. We absolutely recommend this beautiful place in Kamara! Thank you for everything.
20613125,Teresa July 2018 If you are looking for a place to stay in Corfu  stop. Stay here. Stay here. Stay here. Eleni and her family made their house a truly unique and special airbnb experience. If you care to know why  keep reading: it's a long review  because they deserve it. Practicalities first: the house is in the middle of the island  in a secluded and quiet village. We found it much better to stay there: July  island was full and yet the place made us feel like locals. Eleni was kind enough to.pick us up from the airport and took us straight to a place where we could rent a vespa (corfu vespa tours - the vespas were all brand new  well taken care of  and Nikos  the owner  really knows his business and loves it. A true must in the island)  and its really easy and convenient to move around with it: we never found trouble parking and explored the island quite a lot. So the location was great. The bedroom is exactly like the photos (ac works great  the shower is great  there's fresh fruit  water  coffee  electric kettle  all waiting for you there  the windows are soundproofed  so it's really quiet)  as is the rest of the house: really pretty  the pool is a big big plus and really well maintained. The garden is a joy  beautiful  full of flowers  tree full of fruits and vegetables  all cared with love by Nicolas  Eleni's father. He knows a lot about the plants  don't hesitate to ask. He also.makes his own wine  beer and raquia! We were received by Maria  Eleni's mother  with two bowls of Greek yogurt with sweet grapes and figs  that she caramelises herself  and cherry liqueur. Quite a welcome. Maria is an amazing cook  responsible for the great breakfasts that we had every morning  every day a different one. All delicious. When I told her I cook and would like to learn something Greek  she promptly offered to teach me and we spend a couple of amazing hours in her kitchen. She speaks little English  but understands a lot  and we communicated perfectly. That sort of thing is what makes the stay at Kamariti so special: it is a family of really amazing people. They have a true interest in knowing people  are kind  happy to help  talk and explain whatever you want to know. They even invited us and the other couple that was staying there for a great dinner of Grilled fish and salad fresh from the garden  with their wine and fruits for dessert. At the same time  they give you plenty of privacy and space. We would not have been better received if we had gone to see our families  and were really sorry to leave. Corfu is beautiful and worth the time  but it was our stay with this family that made the experience truly unique and special. If you like to keep to yourself all the time  prefer impersonal service and... Show more Response from Eleni July 2018 Thank you Teresa for your time writing that review. I can only say that it is as exciting as your personality :) Really appreciated!
20613125,Paul June 2018 5 out 5 stars: well worth it  it is how a good air BNB must be: - Good bed - Good bathroom - Very clean - Nice swimming pool - Great view on the surrounding nature (trees birds and things). - Very good breakfast  And the bonus the hospitality  have the WOW-factor. They are really interested in the people who visit the place. If we did have a question in the evening they invite os to join (watching football) give us beer  homemade wine and food.  And one night the small village of Kamara (60 people) did have a local BBQ  and because we are there guest of house Kamaritis they would like that we also did come. And of course the atmosphere was great (we did got Greek Salad  lots of Souvlaki  beers/Wine and Greek dancing). Nice talking to the other people of the village.  Eleni very thanks that we could visit your place !! Show more
20613125,Irene June 2018 Best Airbnb ever! We wanted a relaxing holiday and this place made it very special. We stayed for 12 days and for the first time we chose to stay in just one place. It is a great location right in the middle of the island and we explored all parts by scooter. The room was perfectly clean and airy  the pool is very well maintained and the garden is beautiful. Thanks to Eleni’s parents we tried all different kinds of fruit from the garden  and the breakfast was absolutely wonderful. Eleni and her family were so welcoming and helped us out with everything we needed and more. Pick up from the airport  scooter rental but also the best family diner as a goodbye gift. The family is very friendly  gives you privacy but is very warm at the same time. I would definitely recommend this place.
20613125,Paolo September 2017 Eleni and her family has been amazing during our stay! Thanks!!!
20613125,Claudio & Nath September 2017 My girlfriend and I spent 5 days at Eleni and Grigoris' place  and we absolutely loved it. The house and room are very cozy and comfortable  with the pool as a big plus. We also give 5 stars to Maria's breakfast! She and the rest of her family made us feel at home and gave us great advices about Corfu. We absolutely recommend their place  which is one of the best airbnb we have ever been!
20613125,Danny September 2017 We have just returned from a fantastic week at Eleni's place at Kamaritis Villa  Kamara  up in the stunning mountains of Corfu. Our room was beautifully decorated including en-suite bathroom and French doors leading out onto a private balcony. This looks out onto a large  extremely well maintained swimming pool. The view from the pool of the mountains and forest  is literally breath taking. Only a short drive to beaches  shops and the main town. Eleni's family were so welcoming  they make you feel part of the family but also respect your privacy. We have already booked a return trip for next year.  Kind Regards  Danny and Pippa Matthews
20613125,Doruntina September 2017 We had a wonderful stay at Eleni's place: a villa in the middle of nature  surrounded by cypress hills and olive groves. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable  with a separate entrance and a nice little balcony. The house has a very nice swimming pool with beautiful views all around. There is a hiking a trail nearby  perfect for morning walks and nice little villages not too far. But most importantly  Eleni's family is wonderful. They welcomed us warmly and made us feel at home. In short: a perfect little gem! We really hope to come back again someday.

20613125,Merel August 2022 We stayed in Kerkyra first and then a few days with Eleni. The airbnb is a very nice and good base to discover the rest of Corfu with a rental car. The pool is a plus  you can lie there quietly and also eat something in the outdoor kitchen with tables. Eleni is easily accessible  friendly and her family too  we were immediately pampered on arrival. The room is ok for two people  air conditioning and fan work well!

20613125,Isabelle July 2022 a magnificent stay  an address to be recommended without hesitation and especially to keep and renew. The setting is splendid  the house is in a small isolated village (essential means of transport) facing the mountain  the only noise is the singing of cicadas. The room is small but functional and cute  but life takes place outside in the garden with the lovely pool. In addition to the idyllic setting  what makes the difference is the welcome and attention of the family. While respecting the intimate they are present by a note  help and every day Maria spoils us with her kitchen. The restaurant becomes unnecessary. It was a nice holiday and leaving was difficult as it felt. One of the best experiences in Air b and b. Translated from French  Show original

20613125,Sara September 2019 Best room we could find in Corfu! Everything was perfect! Beautiful moments in Kamaritis  where we spent a week enjoying nature and the view from the balcony of the room and by the pool. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by Eleni's family  who brought us a delicious snack in the room. The room is small but really cozy and  above all  equipped with all the comforts you could want: a small refrigerator  a toaster  a kettle and dishes for meals  so that they are still independent even without the kitchen. Maria's breakfasts are the most beautiful and tasty gift Corfu has made us  as they are always prepared with love and abundance. We could choose whether to eat on our deck or at the patio table by the pool. Nikolas also helped us with renting a car  as the house is in a very small and hilly village  however the location allows you to easily reach the coasts. Corfu Town is a 20-minute drive.

20613125,Florian September 2018 We stayed in kamaritis for 1 week. It was just beautiful. The location is great if you want to be quickly in Corfu Town (20 minutes)  yet enjoy the tranquility in the Greek hinterland. The beaches (Ágios gorgios or Peleka Beach) can also be reached super quickly. The apartment was in great condition and furnished with a lot of love. The pool is also nicely decorated and clean. But the family was our highlight. Rarely have we been able to feel so much warmth and kindness as here. Breakfast was brought to the terrace every morning and alternated regularly. If you're looking for Greek hospitality and a little secret quiet retreat  this is the place to be.  We would book here again at any time. Translated from German  Show original

46458949,Jodie August 2022 We loved the place  the views were amazing and the pool was stunning. If staying you will probably need a car if you aren’t a fan of walking up hills. The inside is cosy and we’ll definitely come back again. The local tavernas are so friendly and the local attractions were beautiful. The beaches are crystal clear and if wanting a bonus treat renting a boat gives added pleasure.

46458949,Peter May 2022 This beautiful villa was the perfect place to relax and unwind. It felt completely private and secluded yet close to a little supermarket and had fantastic views over the sea.

46458949,Stephen August 2021 Lovely traditional greek villa. Views spectacular from the pool area and lovely pool. Bathrooms and kitchen slightly dated  but any problems we had (and it was only light bulbs and BBQ tools) were very smoothly sorted out. The walk up to the villa from the supermarket / restaurants is very steep and not for the faint hearted in the heat  but you are rewarded by the views. The villa also had a mid week clean which was much appreciated. The app to let you know when the villa was ready is a good idea in essence  but did not work for us. The villa was ready  but it did not update  so something to beware of. Response from Sofronios August 2021 Dear Stephen  Hello from Eos Villas. Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

Thanks again to the team for making our holiday so memorable.
49975544,Philipp October 2022 Awesome location overlooking the sea  without any obstruction. The house is beautiful  very new and very clean. The only challenge is the street to the house  about 30% steep.

The villa was amazing  stunning views  beautifully kept inside and out and fabulous communication from the villa management pre  during and post our trip. Would highly recommend to others and we are already looking forward to our return stay next year.
49975544,Claudia October 2021 Beautiful villa  gorgeous views  great hosts  spotlessly clean. As others have mentioned pretty scary hill to get up to the property from the road. If like us you are in a mini van make sure you are a confident driver.
49975544,Helen October 2021 An absolutely stunning villa with the most incredible view over the bay. The pictures are true to life. We had a wonderful holiday.

The location is perfect  the path to the villa is steep  but this gives you a wonderful view and with a small walk of about 5 minutes  restaurants and a cool bar can be reached quickly. We didn't miss anything! The hosts go out of their way and help quickly with everything! Would prefer this villa again at any time if I was on Corfu  just perfect!

42766170,Deb October 2022 Lovely apartment in a lovely location. Most of the local businesses had closed for the summer when we stayed but the beach bar was our favourite location  oh and coffee lovers cafe for breakfast just below the apartment was amazing.
42766170,Brigette October 2022 Fantastic modern Villa in a lovely relaxed area with great choice of restaurants. Johnny was very accommodating and check in was easy. There was also a change of linen during the stay. Would love to stay again. A wonderful coffee shop with great breakfast downstairs. Perfect family vacation.
42766170,Yanoulla September 2022 Had a great stay. Clean and modern apartment and quick  helpful responses from the host.
42766170,Karen & Tony September 2022 This villa is a really gem. It had everything you needed and was spotlessly clean. Great comms with host throughout and we were lucky enough to be able to gain access earlier than planned  which was very much appreciated. It was fab to have a dedicated parking space. The location is fab  there is a supermarket just opposite  a coffee shop below  bakery just a few steps away and lots of restaurants within walking distance to chose from. We would highly recommend La Piazza (just opposite)  Lord Byron (10 mins walk) and for snacks / cocktails we loved Skala with its amazing views and the owner is so lovely (12 min walk). We really want to visit again in 2023.
42766170,Geoffrey September 2022 A wonderful new building  great views  super location  and spotlessly clean!
42766170,Stephanie August 2022 View is stunning - having the private pool was just perfect! Less than 5 minute walk to the beach - aircon kept us Comfortable in the heat and the team was very quick with all responses and questions we had during our stay!
42766170,Luca July 2022 The villa is a modern amazing house and the view is special. The position is favorable!
42766170,Sue July 2022 We had a lovely 2wks in the villa in July. There was a heatwave the first week so the pool/shade and aircon were a life saver. The villa had everything we needed and was very clean. Cindy went the extra mile to help. We were regulars at Coffee Lovers below the villa and the staff were so helpful  the coffee and food fab too! The pool was the perfect temperature for the time of year.
42766170,Joey June 2022 We had a fantastic stay at this beautiful villa! It is very spacious and perfectly located. The kitchen is very well equipped and all the appliances worked great. The pool is beautiful and is cleaned regularly. My only small complaint is that additional amenities such as toilet roll  bin bags and kitchen basics were not provided which meant we had to buy an entire roll of bin bags  etc. during the stay.  Overall  we had an amazing time and will definitely be booking here again!
42766170,Camilla June 2022 Really good sized  bright two bed apartment in the middle of Barbati. Super clean. It had a lovely little pool but we primarily headed to the beach just 5 mins down a path. Both Johnny and Cindy were brilliant at communication with Cindy replying instantly when we contacted her about a piping issue (9pm at night) and sending man to fix it first thing.  It is on the road but that didn’t bother us. We had well behaved neighbours while we were there but voices do carry so wouldn’t have wanted a rowdy bunch next door. WiFi was great.  We loved Barbati - still quiet in May and the beach was perfect with really chilled beach clubs down there. Highly recommend hiring a boat from Spiros’ for a day - lovely guys and great boats.
42766170,Nicola May 2022 We stayed at Villa Leo for 6 days with our little girl and friends stayed in the villa next door with their 2yo...the villas were perfect for our stay they had everything we needed and the kids were in and out the pools all week. Spotlessly clean  really easy check-in and great communication. It was a fantastic base to explore the corfu coast. The beach is 5 min walk down the hill and Coffee Lovers under the villa does incredible coffee and breakfasts. There are convenience stores and restaurants all within easy walking distance. Everyone was so friendly and accommodating of the children. Agni beach- a 15 min drive away was our best meal by far at Taverna Agni and we had a couple of nights exploring Corfu town which were wonderful. We had cars and that made exoring really easy with the kids but people did do buses and taxis. We wouldnt hesitate to recommend Villa Leo and we really had the best family trip abroad.
42766170,Tina April 2022 Johnnys place is amazing! You have a lot of space for four people! The pool and the view is just stunning! The house has everything needed. The check-in and communication was easy and helpful. The pool was cleaned everyday  linens were changed once within the week  this was nice! Only small thing you should know: if you are sensitive to noise  the street can get quiet loud from car noises at night and during the day. We would definitely come back :)
42766170,Martin April 2022 Great modern villa in good location with great coffee shop underneath. Lovely beach 5 mins walk and we everything you need for a great holiday close by
42766170,Ben April 2022 Great  newly built villa. Bathroom and kitchen are all clean and to a really high spec. The pool was lovely - if a little cold in April  but we knew that when booking! BBQ’d every night on the terrace. Barbati itself is a great small town to stay in  even at this time of year  before peak season - a few restaurants just starting to open  the lovely Coffee Lovers cafe open just downstairs and the perfect distance between Corfu Old Town and the beautiful countryside to explore a bit of both! In terms of service  really nice that we got a mid-week clean and a special thanks to Cindy our host who saved us with an emergency shop  left in the villa for us  when our original flight got cancelled and we turned up very late Saturday night! Thanks for a great  chilled week in a beautiful place!
42766170,Kinkini April 2022 We had a fantastic stay at Villa Leo end of March. The property pictures and description as advertised are fully accurate. The property is done to a very good standard with air conditioning / heating in all the rooms. Though we were not able to use the swimming pool very much  as it was still cool  it was a lovely pool and sea view to look out to   especially at night. Coffee lovers downstairs was fantastic and perfect for getting breakfast sorted in the morning . Few lovely tavernas nearby . We visited Taverna Roumeli few times and loved it there. Couple of super markets close by as well . Would definitely recommend for a stay in Corfu. We’d love to be back again.
42766170,Gilberto November 2021 The house is exactly like the photos show it . Very good option to stay a couple of days .
42766170,Ahm October 2021 Great villa  perfect swimming pool and grand view on the ocean! Villa and pool were very clean.
42766170,Natalie October 2021 Amazing villa with private pool. Great pool (un-heated) with sun lounges. upstairs balconies get a great view of the beach to watch the sun-rise and receives sun until late-afternoon. Very comfortable stay with all you would need - kitchen  TV  good wifi  washing machine. Self check-in was super easy. Would not hesitate to recommend to others.  Definitely also recommend Coffee Lovers cafe (just below the villa) for great breakfast & coffees - all the staff are lovely.
42766170,Flo October 2021 Ver nice villa near Barbati Beach. The highlight is the terrace with the pool and the wonderful view over the bay. We were allowed to check in earlier which was great (thanks again). All the communication with the host was done via Whatsapp. Another plus is that there is a good cafe in the house below the villa. The villa ist located right at the main road. That can cause some noise of course but we did not considered this disturbing. Unfortunately we had an issue with the warm water supply but the hosts tried their best to get it fixed asap.
42766170,Flore October 2021 The villa is great  very clean and perfectly located. There is coffee shop  some restaurants and several supermarkets next to the villa. The beach is 5 min walking. We definitely recommend !
42766170,Taylor September 2021 absolutely beautiful view and great location to beach and restaurants. the pool is an added bonus. best place in corfu. child friendly and the hosts were extremely helpful. I'd go back and recommend to my friends and family.
42766170,Mariana September 2021 Johnny is great! He is super fast and offers a great service!
42766170,Rose September 2021 Exceptional location  modern very nice place  lovely pool. A great spot.
42766170,Niklas August 2021 Nice little villa with a Great view!
42766170,Daniella July 2021 We loved our stay at Villa Leo. Cindy was always available if we needed assistance. The pool was amazing and well maintained. The view was also beautiful. There was a bbq  sunlounges and a nice table outside to sit and enjoy the pool area. Everything was clean and very comfortable.
42766170,Gosia July 2021 We have had an amazing stay at Villa Leo <3 It definitely met our expectations  and much  much more!  The villa is beautiful  modern  very well designed and organized. Having our own  private pool was an extra luxury! It was very handy to be able to quickly cool down in it at any point of the day or evening. It was cleaned every day by a very friendly man  who always smiled and asked how we are doing when he saw us.  The hosts (Johnny and Cindy) were very friendly and always happy to help. In general everyone we spoke with  both at the villa and in the local supermarkets and restaurants  was fluent or almost fluent in English  which made it very easy to communicate.  We stayed in the villa with my husband and our two-year-old son  together with my parents. The villa was a very good size for our family  and everyone had enough space. Our son had plenty of room to run around and play hide-and seek with us  and there were no parts of the house that we considered dangerous or risky for him. Three bathrooms in total made it super easy to get ready and go out  because there was never a queue to the toilet :) Air conditioning in all rooms was also very handy  especially when we wanted a little break from the heat.  Amazing place  definitely worth recommending!  We can also recommend the Coffee Lovers cafe right underneath the villa  with delicious coffee  ice cream  desserts and more. And very friendly owners :)  Oh  and the beach is super close by (3-4min on foot). There is also a big pool right next to the beach  with a special  shallow section for small kids. Our son loved playing there for hours :) Show more
42766170,Alex July 2021 Absolutely recommended for those who hate busy places!
42766170,Sirin June 2021 Really great place to stay in Corfu. It exceeded our expectations. The villa is very nice  modern  clean and the pool was cleaned every morning. Also  at the groundfloor (under the villa) there is a nice place where you can have your breakfast and near the villa are good restaurants  as well as a supermarket.
42766170,Sheri-Ann October 2020 Just came back from a week's blissful stay at Villa Leo. The villa is ideally located  1 minute walk away from a bakery  super market and many restaurants. Go to the super market past La Piazza towards Lord Byron -cheaper! The local bakery does excellent pastries and sandwhiches for the days you want to spend by your private pool(which is stunning at night). It's a lovely stroll down to the beach  but punishing walk back up the hill to the villa! Keep this in mind if you're coming with a stroller x Caycades and La Piazza were two staples on our trip for food.  Cindy was incredible - really MADE our holiday  sorted taxis for us  was there to greet us with a friendly smile (behind the mask!).  The only negatives which are truly truly outweighed by the positives are a lack of oil  salt and pepper etc. In the pantry when you arrive (unsure if this is due to Covid measures) and if you're coming as a four will be a little difficult to squeeze onto one couch in living room. The villas are built next door to each other which means you will hear noises! But honestly a simple knock on the door to turn the music down a bit works  Again overall a brilliant stay. Greece does social distancing better than the English do! Show more
42766170,Chris October 2020 Great villa  everything is very new and clean and the views are excellent. Cindy was very responsive and made check in very easy  and was quick to reply to any questions. Really nice place to relax  and the beach is a short walk away. There is a supermarket and a few restaurants within walking distance also  and parking at the villa is very easy. I would recommend hiring a car to get the most out of staying here  as there are a lot of beautiful beaches and towns around.
42766170,Alanna September 2020 Nice place  great location & fabulous views  great for short or long trips  Relaxing Lovely restaurants and amazing bakery/coffee 2 mins away. Definitely will look at booking again for 2021
42766170,Filip September 2020 Great Villa  we had an amazing time would totally recommend it.
42766170,Graeme & Steph August 2020 We have just returned from a 5 star stay courtesy of Key’N’Stay. The communication prior to our trip was easy  any question asked answered promptly and this was mirrored at check in. Cindy took the time to show us round the space and made sure we were comfortable before leaving us to it. It really is a great space  it’s clear it’s recently been renovated as everything is so clean and new and suited our family unit perfectly. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend both the apartment and location. Johnny / Cindy  thanks for exceeding expectations.
42766170,Sharon August 2020 An amazing apartment with everything you need  Beautiful location with great restaurants very close by. Great for families or couples.
42766170,Carine June 2022 The house is very functional  well-equipped and maintained. The pool is very nice. Hosts are welcoming. One problem though: the house is located on the edge of one of the main roads of the island so there is noise Translated from French  Show original
42766170,Kati October 2021 The apartment is nice and bright and very spacious. The view from the bedrooms and the living room is really very nice. When the weather is good  you can see Corfu city. The part of the outdoor area is covered and therefore easily usable in any weather. The pool is not heated and therefore too cold in the fall. The main road leads right in front of the house  which disturbed us a bit. Definitely should know. It is only a few meters to the beach and restaurants are also within easy walking distance. The coffee is highly recommended under the apartment - even for a snack in the evening. Check-in was hassle-free and we were also allowed to leave the apartment a little later  which helped us a lot with the late return flight. Thank you again! Translated from German  Show original
42766170,Sandra October 2021 The place is very well located and was clean. Communication was straightforward and quick. Translated from German  Show original
42766170,Saad May 2021 The stay was very nice  the villa is beautiful and modern  with a terrace and a pool with beach views. The neighborhood is also nice (cafe  restaurant  and supermarket). To highlight the good welcome from Cindy  who is very accommodating. Translated from French  Show original
43782994,Thomas August 2022 Nice place  great pool  super clean  super friendly hosts. Strongly recommend to visit this place
43782994,Matt July 2022 We had the most amazing time at Kumquart Estate. The accommodation was brilliant and the service Alexandra gave was first class. The rooms are fantastic  well equipped and very comfortable. The pool and the communal facilities are a real highlight. Alexandra’s communication throughout was exceptional and she helped us find local attractions and organised excursions with no trouble whatsoever. We felt very welcome and looked after and will no doubt be back again in the future.
43782994,Pierre-Alexis September 2021 My best experience with an Airbnb host! Alexandra and Nikos were very kind  helpful with us during our stay. The villa is very clean and amazing for a large group. The place to be in the Corfu heaven!
43782994,Yael September 2021 Wow !! I do not know where to start. Our experience was perfect. The place is perfect and even more beautiful than the pictures. Alexandra was amazing  nice and available for any question and help. We are already waiting to go back there !! I would not go anywhere else on the island.
43782994,Yan August 2021 I went with a group of 20 people to Alexandra’s place and we loved it. The house is better then the pictures suggest and Alexandra and Niko the hosts are super friendly people that helped us with everything we needed and more. The pool and the apartments were cleaned regularly and we could borrow bicycles for a low fee. The beach is 15 minutes away walking. There are enough parking spots (we had 3 big cars  there would have been space for more!). Internet works perfect also when a lot of people use it. All in all we had a perfect stay and I would definitely recommend this house for any kind of big group.
43782994,Yoni July 2021 Alexandra and Nicos were very welcoming and went over and beyond to make sure we are happy and enjoying our stay. Highly recommend!
43782994,Khlil July 2021 Alexandra is a very kind host who’s been very helpful and manage a really good estate. I definitely recommend her!
43782994,Calum September 2020 We’re just back for a beautiful stay at Villa Kumquart. It was everything and more that we could have wished for. Set surrounded by beautiful mountains it’s the perfect place to unwind. There’s tons of space around the villa and a short drive to the nearby beach. Alexandra was the perfect host  leaving each house with a welcome pack of local foods and guide books. Alexandra was on hand to answer any of our questions and any issues were quickly resolved. We can’t fault Alexandra or Villa Kumquart. Thanks again for an enjoyable stay.
43782994,Hector August 2020 Absolutely wonderful villa and area. So nice to have so much space. Communication and cleanliness were fantastic.
43782994,Jon August 2020 This is more than a good base to explore this beautiful part of the island. Kumquarts is immaculate  stylishly furnished and nestled in the hillside of a lovely area but within a pleasant 15 minute walk to the nearest beach. As a host  Alexandra couldn't have been more helpful with quick and accurate responses to my numerous texts regarding supermarkets  beaches  places of interest etc etc. Pool  air con  amenities  location  cleanliness - all excellent. Thanks for a great stay Alexandra.
43782994,Rosie August 2020 Alexandra is a brilliant host. She is super quick to respond to any questions or queries.  The estate is in a lovely setting and a really stylish place to stay.  The pool is fantastic clean and a great size the houses are lovely and beds are super comfy.  There is a road that runs in front of the property so there is some light road noise of people going down to the beach but nothing major.  The bay below is a busy organised beach with bars and pedalos etc.  The old school taverna nearby has fantastic really ‘local’ food.  All in all we had a lovely safe clean week here despite the strange times we are living in!
43782994,Magda August 2020 We travel a lot - Both for business&privately. From many hosts we’ve met during the years Alexandra is trully exceptional. Not only communication was perfect (super responsive)  check-in/out times fully flexible  when we arrived at night she was waiting for us with complementary dinner when I mentioned we will be hungry and wanted to find open tavern.  House itself is a perfect vacay spot - very private and comfortable. Everything you need to have a reset from everyday chores. Nicely equipped with barbecue  comfy chairs  sunbads  espresso machine  and all the stuff you'll need. And the pool !!! So perfect for a day or night swim. Good location for all the sightseeing. Car is amust IMHO.  In the time of pandemic this house is highly recommended - secluded  private pool  if you wish to - you can socially distance yourself from everyone else. We felt completely safe as everyone on the island treat pandemic seriously.  Warning! If you're looking for a party spot for clubbing find something else... On another island ;) Corfu is a place for dinner wine and peace lovers. Show more
43782994,Rena October 2022 We had a perfect stay with 15 people. Super nice hosts and a really special accommodation with loving furnishings where everything was sparkling clean. Every day a cleaner came to clean all the rooms and the pool. The location is a bit off - which was perfect for us as we could also be louder without disturbing anyone.

36684128,Nilda August 2022 Tessy's home is beautiful!! Our stay was made easy by all the comforts offered. The location and views are amazing! Great place for a big family. Tessy is very nice and accommodating.
36684128,Antonios August 2022 Great. Nothing to complain about. Very friendly  helped us with everything we needed. As clean as possible.
36684128,Lara August 2022 We arrived quite late and it was lovely to have Tessy waiting for us and waving as we weren’t sure of the exact location. It was lovely to have  water  fruit etc and some basic provisions arriving late at night.  The villa is set up high on a hill with stunning views and it was such a peaceful location.  The villa is well kitted out and met all of our needs. It was clean  light  airy and spacious with good air conditioning upstairs.  It is well located for the old town 15 minutes drive away and for beaches to the north or south.We had hired a car for two weeks and this is a must if you want to explore.  Local supermarket and pharmacy and petrol station 3 minutes drive away.  Plenty of outside seating for our bbqs.  Thank you Tessy for an amazing stay! Show more
36684128,Lorenzo July 2022 As a large group the house was perfect. Tessy was always there as soon as we had some problems  trying to make our stay more and more enjoyable. The house is modern and nice.
36684128,Senga July 2022 This house is just as illustrated. Tessy was a great host and communication was easy. Any issues were sorted immediately and without fuss. Although there is a village close by it is important to have your own transport in order to fully experience the island. I would highly recommend this Airbnb and Tessy as a host.
36684128,Upen June 2022 This is one of the best air bnb we have booked. The stunning views from the front are just breathtaking. Tessy is very helpful  always their phone call away if you need anything. She went out of her way to help me get a surprise booked for my wife.  The location is on the hill  so if you driving perfect. Otherwise you will be climbing alot of hills to get to the house and get down to main road for public transport.  Rooms were perfect with all air-conditioning and storage cupboards with balcony in all room to look at sunset or sunrise. All rooms including bathroom are furnished to high standards and very modern.  You have everything to cook in the kitchen or have a bbq. If you do not have something you want Tessy will supply and help straight away promptly  Finally the views  it was the most breathtaking views we have captured from the house.  Everything was great from communication before stay  while stay and after stay.  Thank you to Tessy and highly recommend this house if you are a big family Show more

36684128,Dariya June 2021 The house is big and extremely well maintained. The location is great  If you want to visit different beaches on the island. The washing machine is a great relief for people with kids  as is the dishwasher. Each room has air conditioning  which is an absolute necessity of the island. We had a great time  we felt at home  and the host was great  very responsive and comprehensive and always willing to help. Thank you  Tessy! See you soon!
36684128,Spiro September 2020 Spotless house  wonderful view  the best facilities. We 100% recommend you to visit and spend the night in this house! All wonderful and the owner was always active in whatever we needed. Close to the center but away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Especially if you have children  it is the most suitable house for your stay  with plenty of space and grass to play with. Thank you very much Mrs. Tessy and we will be very happy to visit you again in the future.
36684128,Brigitte August 2020 We really enjoyed our stay at the hill house. Tessy is a great host and was always quick to answer our questions and help us out! The house is in great shape and the location is just fine - a very quiet place where you can easily travel to any place in Corfu within short time. We highly recommend this house to others!!
36684128,Athena August 2020 The most perfect location! Just outside Corfu old town and off a main road to catch the arteries to all the fabulous beaches of the island!! And a stellar view!  We were 2 families - myself with my two teen boys and my sister’s family with a toddler. The house was very comfortable and spacious and accommodated is with ease. Tessy was extremely responsive and very hospitable and without a doubt  we would definitely come back again!

52201323,Jelena August 2022 Abelaki3 house is a paradise on Earth! I didn’t want to leave it! :) So cosy and well-equipped  plus perfectly decorated. What I liked best was the beautiful garden with a lot of chairs and the sun bed. All with a nice sea view  being located just a couple of minutes walk from the nice beach. Alexia is a perfect host! She was so kind to bring us some things we needed and always made sure we felt comfortable in her home. I would highly recommend this place!

52201323,Stefan July 2022 The proprety is both rustic and modern. The kitchen is well equiped. The living room is just the right size for a couple. The bathroom is modern and very clean. The best part of it  being the spacious shower. Me and my wife are tall so we apeciated the space to move while showering. The double bed had a firm/hard matress. Air conditioning did it's job in cooling the room fast. At the proprety we had no signal  but the wifi was good. Sugestion: the area of Panamoras has lush vegetation so a mosquito lotion or spray would come in handy when going to the beach or walking in the evening. At the proprety  Alexia thought of this and we had mosquito repelant in the garden and in the house  so it was perfect. The road to the proprety was narrow after going of the main road  with a lot of corners  and most of the road with enough space for 1.5 cars :)) I think this is the norm here  so we had to always be careful for the oncomming traffic. The beach is part sand  part with oval rocks with polished edges. The entry in the water is gradual. The seabed is sandy. Under 5 min from the proprety to the beach. Alexia was very helpful and answered all our questions. We felt like she thought about every little detail in this location  so it could offer a like home experience.

52201323,Lennart June 2022 The accommodation with beautiful views of the sea was just perfect. With a nice living room with large sofa bed  a very cozy bedroom with a make-up mirror  a small but nice bathroom  a great well equipped kitchen with fridge  freezer  washing machine  and even a small dishwasher!! Simply great. The highlight for us was the outdoor area. A super lovingly furnished terrace with several seating areas and a barbecue! From there we could enjoy sunset every evening. The beach is only 10 min walk away. You can also use the pool. The wlan was also good  you can also work if you have to. And the air conditioning is super!! It’s in the living room  and in the night you can let it on  and you never get ill in your bedroom because of the freshness. Best idea.  The owners are all very nice!! And you have seen that the entire property  both inside and outside  is furnished and maintained with a lot of love. Just wonderful! Thank you very much for your warmth and your hospitality.

52201323,Julia June 2022 We loved spending a week in Alexia's apartment. The outside area is incredible and we enjoyed our days there. If you want to relax and calm down  this is the perfect place. Be aware that Paramonas is a tiny village with just three restaurants and without any supermarket. The nearest is a 10-15 min drive away. Response from Alexia June 2022 Thank you for your kind words we will be happy to host you again
52201323,Nenad June 2022 We stayed in Abelaki3 for 9 days and had a great time. The house is well equipped (barbecue  washing machine  coffee maker  sandwich maker …) the highlight is the paradisiacal garden where you can relax. The hosts are very warm  friendly and accommodating. Thanks for everything Alexia&family! Ευχαριστώ! Hvala!

52201323,Jamilio June 2022 Truly a gem. The place was decorated so neat  also with some of Alexia’s own art!  Alexia went out of her way to provide some goodies to get relaxed on arrival.  At the time we went (end of may) it wasn’t busy. The beach is less then 5 mins walk. Response from Alexia June 2022 Thank you for your kind words we will be happy to host you again
52201323,Monica September 2022 Alexia is a super lovely woman  the arrival that was in the middle of the night went smoothly because she was waiting for us. The cottage is very cozy and clean. In Paramonas  however  you should have a car or a scooter  because there is no shopping  only in the neighboring village 3 km away. It is a place where you really only relax  so if you need peace and quiet and are not looking for a typical tourist beach  then this is the place for you. There are also three restaurants just a 5-10 minute walk away. And for the beach  you should bring shoes  otherwise it will be a bit painful to get into the water and get out.

52201323,"Ραφαηλία September 2022 What to do first for this house. If our experience from all the excursion to Cyprus was 10/8  the house took her to 10/10. The place is very quiet and is on the side of the most ""beautiful"" beaches of Cyprus. The view it has is the infinite blue of the sea. The yard that each room corresponds is a gem  so tidy and pleasant to sit for hours. The house itself is spotless  very nicely decorated  it had all the essentials and many personal touches of our hosts. Alexia had taken care of everything that we could need during our stay there  literally everything. It goes without saying that when we visit Cyprus again  we will live there again. I think it's the most suitable home for someone who's looking to rest.

A super lovingly furnished terrace with sitting area + dining table and barbecue! We sat outside every night and enjoyed the sunset. In addition  you can use a pool. Next door are 2 other fewos from the same operators (a family). The host Alexia was very warm! We really felt at home. She was so sweet and always there for us.

Homemade jam and cake  tips for nice beaches and restaurants. If you are looking for a relaxing stay on Corfu  this is THE BEST PLACE! ❤️
43359516,Julija April 2022 very good location and accommodation is amazing! Highly recommended!
43359516,James April 2022 Renate was an absolutely wonderful host. Couldn’t do enough for us  and even made us a delicious pastry which we enjoyed after an late flight. She was communicative and response to our queries but also gave us plenty of space to explore and enjoy ourselves. She was truly the host of dreams!  The place itself is beautiful  situated 8 minutes walk from a bus stop which can take you to any of the surrounding areas you might want to visit including corfu town.  (If getting the bus for corfu town select the pink ticket from the terminal at the bus stop and make sure to bring coins as it doesn’t accept cash)  The area of gouvia is also very nice  lots of places to eat  get a coffee as well as a few useful shops selling electronics and pharmaceutical products if you need anything like that.  Lovely place to go and catch some sun  would certainly recommend. Show more
43359516,Anastasia August 2021 really unique atmsophere of the house and the garden makes my family forget about every day life. it has all the necessary stuff for cooking and washing. amazing garden   lovely hosts  comfy big house! close to the port and main town of Corfu.
43359516,Atina July 2021 Renate’s place is a beautiful paradise. The Airbnb is big and spacious (by American standards!) and also charmingly decorated with every need met. The gardens are a Mediterranean dream. Renate was endlessly kind and gracious  with a tour of the gardens  homemade wine and olive oil  homemade apricot tarte  eggs from her chickens… Highly recommend!
43359516,Caroline May 2021 Spotlessly clean  spaciousand comfortable accommodation. Everything you need in the kitchen including a few welcome treats. Well appointed bathrooms and a spare loo! Beautiful surroundings in a peaceful location but not far from Gouvia and the shops. Transport recommends but it would be possible to cope without a car. There are bikes to use and it is lovely to walk in the countryside.
43359516,Casey November 2020 We had a lovely stay at Renate's place. The apartment is huge and has a great outdoor seating area too. It's modern and spotlessly clean with everything you need. You'll need a rental car to get there but it's fairly essential to see the rest of the island anyway. Renate was really helpful helping us figure out Greek lockdown too!
43359516,Ryan October 2020 Wow. Hands down the best Airbnb experience I’ve had to date. Where do I start...  Not only was Renate extremely helpful in giving us local tips  bus times and delicious produce from her garden (think the best extra virgin olive oil  wine  prickly pears and olives known to humankind)   she even took us to our next Airbnb and picked us up from the local supermarket the day we arrived. A truly sublime host who genuinely couldn’t do enough.  The house is just off the beaten track in Gouvia  so super peaceful. A great kitchen for cooking. The jewel in the crown is the front veranda  gets heaps of sun in the morning (then you can follow it round the side of the house with sun loungers if that’s your vibe  definitely worked for me)  big table for eating and large patio space for yoga/excercise/ lying down on the floor. Spacious bedroom and great for two people. The WiFi was perfect  and there are multiple spots to work from.  For such a peaceful spot  Gouvia town (from which you can take buses  buy delicious groceries  swim or go out to eat) is a 10 minute walk. So you have the balance of peace and frenzy. All buses are very good if you don’t have a car  but would definitely recommend the latter.  Will 100% be coming back here if I’m ever in Corfu again. Thanks Renate! Show more
43359516,Jesús August 2020 Much better than expected!!!  Renate is so nice!! The apartment is bigger than we thought. It’s perfect to see the Island in the day and have a dinner in Corfu old town (or in the nice chill area that this place have). This was one of the best Airbnb experiences we had. Hope to comeback someday and of course we recommend everyone to go to Renate’s place. Really great value!
43359516,Rhodes October 2022 It is a lovely house   very centrally located on Corfu and yet in the middle of nature  with everything you could want.

43359516,Michael August 2022 WOW! The apartment is just perfect  well laid out  large and bright rooms  with complete and high-quality equipment. Due to the storage of the apartment  I did not miss air conditioning even at over 30 degrees outside temperature. On the contrary  I greatly appreciated that the temperature in the apartment was very pleasant  especially without air conditioning. The seating on the covered terrace or under the olive tree overlooking the magnificent garden are simply fantastic. In addition  the hospitality of Renate and her husband with tips on excursion destinations  restaurants to the mediation of a physiotherapist  which we had to use at short notice. The delicious homemade jam and cake were the icing on the cake  as well as fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden  which we were also offered. Translated from German  Show original

43359516,Hendrik May 2022 The place was great  even for our toddler. Renate makes sure you have everything you need during your stay. Small attentions such as the homemade jam with fruits from our own garden or a few eggs from the chickens were the so-called icing on the cake for a already great vacation. Thanks also for the nice conversations in between!  The accommodation is the perfect mix of being close to the action and slightly away from the tourist hustle and bustle.  Actually  we are always looking for new destinations for our vacations  but we may come back to the Doctors House in Corfu! Translated from German  Show original

43359516,Annette June 2021 Niko and Renate's house exceeded our expectations. It is absolutely quietly located in a well-kept  huge garden. The apartment is extremely spacious with 2 very large bedrooms (mattresses 1 A) and 1 large bathroom each. There is even a living room with TV (could see the German football game...). The apartment was still pleasantly tempered in June as the sun can always be stopped by shutters. In addition  all windows and doors have excellent mosquito repellent devices. We didn't have a mosquito or any other insect in the apartment! The kitchen is also huge and has everything you need. A stove with oven  large dining table  coffee maker  espresso machine  even a washing machine. Everything was spotlessly clean. We spent a lot of time on the covered terrace overlooking the great olive trees and Renate's loving vegetable garden. Nico and Renate are excellent hosts  we were warmly welcomed with a delicious apricot cake. Due to the fact that both speak German  we were able to learn a lot about Corfu and had nice conversations. I have never been better accommodated and can definitely recommend Docotor's house. Thank you very much for the great hospitality. We will be back !!! Annette and Dietmar.

11779734,Fiona September 2022 The host was super helpful with directions and questions we asked him. Very friendly and dedicated to his customers. The house would need a couple more amenities  especially in the kitchen.
11779734,Laura August 2022 We had a lovely stay and particularly liked the location  being so close to a great beach as well as some nice restaurants and a beach bar. Also handy to have a bus stop so close.
11779734,Rebecca August 2022 This is a truly gorgeous place  all the good reviews are accurate. The apartment is just as you see on the photos and catered for all our needs. There are a couple of other apartments but it is well designed so you feel pretty private with plenty of different outside areas to sit and take in the view. The beach across the road is a tranquil place to spend time  loungers are free and the beach bar/cafe has a beautiful view across the bay. The winding coastal road is below the apartment and has no impact on your view. We did hire a car but could have managed perfectly well with just hiring one in the nearby village for the odd day out. We also hired a boat for the day from Messonghi to explore the bays  tavernas with jettys and a beautiful lagoon near the sandbanks. George was very accessible and helpful where needed and brought us figs on our arrival from their own trees. Thank you for a most wonderful holiday.
11779734,Darko August 2022 Good location

11779734,Melissa July 2022 We had an amazing stay at George’s place. It was everything we were looking for and so much more. The area is absolutely perfect  with a beach just down the stairs with very few people. There are only a few restaurants nearby and we tried all of them  and the food was great in all so you can’t go wrong. Everyone we met was so warm and welcoming here too. George was a fantastic host  he answered all our questions so quickly and helped us navigate everything much easier.  We truly had the perfect stay here and hope to come back and stay here again. If you want to relax and be away from the rest of the tourists we can’t recommend this place enough!
11779734,Naomi June 2022 We had a really lovely time at Georges apartment. The apartment is basic but adequate and had good air-con. The location is beautiful  theres amazing views looking out to sea with mountains in Greece mainland visible in the distance. Theres a small private beach just a few minutes away which was quiet  clean and had loungers/shades. It is also used by guests from the next door hotel. We were able to use the pool and beach bar at the hotel next door free of charge. The only down side i would say is that the road is very dangerous to walk along as theres no pavement so its not easy to walk to local tavernas and shops. There is a bus stop opposite and its easy to get the bus to Corfu Town which is 30 mins north. George was great communicating and extremely helpful helping me to get my bag back from a bus when i left it on there by mistake!
11779734,Alejandro June 2022 What a fantastic place! George is an amazing and caring host. The room was perfect for my family. Let me add  the view is amazing!  Fourtuna is the place to go if you want to take some time for yourself or with the family. It is also a place to seek inspiration or perhaps reflect on life. We really loved it. Did I say that George is an amazing host? He’s the best!
11779734,Zoe June 2022 We had the best time in this apartment! The small beach opposite was so idyllic and quiet. The road was busy and without footpath to walk to restaurants but we did it at least once every day so easily doable. There is a local bus stop opposite for getting into Corfu Town. The room itself was clean and tidy with all amenities you could need  the local mini markets however don’t provide a great deal of ingredients to cook meals so we did mainly eat out. We would definitely recommend this apartment for value for money and the view from the balcony was beautiful.
11779734,Stela June 2022 Great place  great views!
11779734,Ieva June 2022 Thank you for the vacation  the view and the garden is absolutely stunning! The communication with George is very fast and easy! Thank you for the vacation!
11779734,Lily May 2022 This place was amazing!!! Stunning view and nice location. Stayed with three friends and it worked out ideally. George was so helpful and I couldn’t recommend it more highly!
11779734,Vendula October 2021 Very clean apartment with beautiful big terrace. Don’t forget aqua shoes for the beach! The hosts are very nice and give helpful tips.
11779734,Franka September 2021 Great apartment with an amazing view and George was a extremly nice host  he even offered to pick us up from the airport! Would definitely recommend!
11779734,Ella September 2021 George was so helpful and good at communicating. The apartment was lovely  location is fantastic  opposite the beach and just down the road from the local village. Would highly recommend.
11779734,Ondine September 2021 The location of the apartment is ideal  with a great location and an amazing view on the sea! I truly recommend this place! George is easily reachable and accommodating!
11779734,Lilli August 2021 George is a very nice and helpful host! We had a wonderful time in the apartment.
11779734,Maximilien August 2021 Nice stay at this apartment  George welcomed us and the communication was good. A car is needed from this location to move easily. Everything was working and clean. The AC was particularly helpful.
11779734,Philip June 2021 It was a fantastic holiday on Corfu at in George’s apartment. Very classy Greek style apartment with nice see view. George was also a fantastic host. Hope we can comeback soon!
11779734,Virginija June 2021 We enjoyed the terrace and view to the sea. The accommodation is basic with limited WiFi. Response from George July 2021 As far as WiFi is concerned  you never mentioned any problem. I would have fixed it up immediately. I always do as much as I can to improve conditions.
11779734,Sarah May 2021 We had a great stay at George’s place  the view is great  the beach very near and George is always ready to provide tips. Thank you George !
11779734,Leah August 2020 George and his family are amazing! They are so kind and giving  we felt very well looked after by them. The house is great  right by the ocean. There is a small beach you can go to which is really beautiful  and a sandier one just down the road. Great trip and many positive memories :)
11779734,Dawn July 2019 George our host picked us up from airport. Only 20 mins to resort. Tavernas in both directions and hotel bars. Guests can use nearby hotel pool  but the beach was fab. Small quiet stoney beach 2 mins below. Lovely beach bar above. Great food. Sunbeds free. A 10 min stroll to main beach. Shingle/sand. Chargeable beds etc. Handfull of beach tavernas. Very friendly and relaxing. Small supermarkets and travel agent where you can book several boat or coach tours. We didnt drive so this was great. Fab boat trip to Durrells house. A must. Loved Aghios Ioannis Peristeron. Would defo go back.
11779734,Fadi Mikhael August 2018 best holiday we had
11779734,Susanna August 2018 Good  basic accommodation. Friendly and helpful host. Great location. With a small stony beach opposite the apartment and a cliff top cafe. Bus stop right outside the apartment so getting into Corfu town is very easy. Coming back is a bit harder. The bus does not leave from the square in which it drops you off but is another good 10 minute walk  which feels a long way with children in August heat. The return bus stop isn’t marked so George recommended asking for the one after Louis hotel. They didn’t really understand this but we managed to get off fairly near! We visited the beach area near the supermarket  300-400 m turn right out of apartment. Kids really enjoyed jumping off the jetty here. There is no pavement so If walking down this way cut through the hotel car park on the nasty bend.
11779734,Zolna July 2018 Family friendly environment  friendly hosts  fantastic seaview. We had a wonderful week there  definetly recommend.:)
11779734,Tara September 2017 What a perfect week. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Spiros's place and would recommend to everyone.  The apartment is in a great location  literally across the road from a small  beautiful rocky beach with clear water and lots of fish to see snorkelling. A beach bar on the cliff edge of the beach provides a wide range of dishes and drinks  perfect after a morning of swimming! Down the road there is a bus stop with regular times to Corfu town  Moraitika and Cavos. Down the other direction (about 10 minutes walk) there is a small supermarket which can provide you with groceries.  The apartment itself is cosy and is exactly what you see in the pictures. It has basic cooking equipment which allowed us to make basic one-pot meals such as pasta dishes. The beds are comfy and the space outside is beautiful that overlooks the sea with a balcony.  Spiros and his family are very friendly and made us feel very welcome! Would highly recommend :) Show more
11779734,László August 2017 Lovely place  lovely host  highly reccomended!
11779734,Raymond June 2017 The location is lovely despite the main road traffic noise.The island has natural beauty but is let down by the stresses imposed on the Greeks and their economy  currently rubbish is strewn all over the island and this needs to be addressed before the season really gets underway.The people we met were all friendly and helpful  they really try to do their best to make you welcome.They need and deserve our support.This property is basic and if that fits your budget then you should have a good time.Thanks for your kind attention Spiros and family.
11779734,Tamara August 2016 We enjoy our holidays in Spiros' s house! Very near at two beautiful beaches  beautiful seaview   beautiful olive tree in front of the window...thanks Spiros!
11779734,Menco July 2016 We were arriving very late and had a warm welcome by the parents of Spiros. It is a perfect place for 4 persons close to the sea. You will have to cross the street and you ll find a quiet beach. Restaurants are at 15min. walking distance. We recommend this place.
11779734,Pia October 2022 We had a great time in a really beautiful place. The view is even more beautiful than in the pictures. The small beach in front of the door was almost private at the beginning of October. The apartment is simply equipped  as in the descriptions  but very clean. George was incredibly helpful and nice. Communication went very smoothly.  You can spend time on site without a car  but the rather busy road in front of the door has no walkway. The surrounding area can be explored by bus  yet it is worth renting a car to reach even more remote places of the island.  We will be happy to come back. Thank you for everything! Translated from German  Show original
11779734,Madeleine August 2022 We have recovered very well in these 2 weeks. The location is outstanding. The apartment leaves nothing to be desired. George is very helpful  friendly and very warm  just like his sister. He is always easy to reach and very attentive. It was all uncomplicated and comfortable. We will be happy to come back and highly recommend the place. We will remember this view and the crystal clear sea for a long time to come. Translated from German  Show original

11779734,Mélody August 2021 Very good welcome from George  who is very accessible. Very clean accommodation. The layout of the kitchen is basic but sufficient for a few meals taken in the apartment. Small surprise when arriving discovering that there was only one bedroom and that the other 2 beds are in fact in the living room. Housing rather well located to move throughout the island and not too far from the city of Corfu. Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Sven July 2021 The apartment is located on Corfu's main coastal road and is therefore easy to reach. The apartment itself is rustically furnished and sufficiently equipped. View from the balcony is the highlight of the apartment and a free beach is right on the other side of the street. Translated from German  Show original
11779734,K July 2021 George welcomed us very warmly. The view is sumptuous and the simple apartment is very clean  a stone's throw from a beach. To be repeated without hesitation. Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Stéphanie July 2021 George's place is ideally located  pleasant and the view is stunning ! George is adorable : welcoming and very responsive to the slightest request. We had a dream week! Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Severine July 2021 Small apartment in a very good location by the sea with just the strict necessities. Minimalist but very clean and Georges is a great responsive host and very available. We recommend ++ Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Nathalie July 2021 The place we were in was very clean  spacious with 1 bedroom with 2 single beds and a living room /kitchen also including 2 benches. We had a large closet  1 bathroom/weekend and 2 air conditioning. There are all the basics but our stay was short we took the opportunity to have our meals at the restaurants around. You will also enjoy a very pleasant flowery courtyard overlooking the sea. For us the biggest advantage of this apartment was the proximity to the small beach  just cross the road ( well passable but not disturbing) and you are on this very quiet little beach. The water is crystal clear  it's a real joy ! Bus stop is in close proximity. Convenient to get to the city of Corfu for example. Otherwise taxis work very well. As for George  he is very friendly and easily reachable. Her sister and husband are also very kind  they welcomed us  and who also came to help us because I left the keys in the apartment and slammed the door...except that the keys are necessary to trigger the trigger. The restaurant staff are very friendly  we were overall very well looked after and will gladly go back. Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Luigi August 2020 George and Olga were very kind  confirming the Hellenic tradition to the fullest. The house is in an elevated position with respect to the road that you have to cross to access the beach. Beautiful sea  an aurora worthy of homemade poems  to be enjoyed with a morning lift but that will reward you with its beauty. The sun rising from Igoumenitsa is spectacular. Too bad to have to return to Italy soon... Translated from Italian  Show original

11779734,Sabine July 2017 Well-placed accommodation with pleasant terrace and garden area  very busy little downside next door..... Very nice welcome from Georges and Spiros. Brief accommodation with amenities (appliances  utensils  and cutlery). We had a very pleasant 15 days with the family. Translated from French  Show original
11779734,Oscar August 2016 The apartment is not bad. Positively  it has a terrace and a small green space under an olive tree where you can eat. You can see the sea. Negatively  it's near a busy street. It also doesn't have kitchenware. We only found one pot with a few spoons and a fork and two knives. It also only has a small double electric stove that one was not working properly. I recommend that you take care of it. The gentlemen who welcomed us were very kind and helpful.

14200662,Lukas October 2022 Treehouse was lovely  breakfast is recommended and host is excellent!
14200662,Chelsea September 2022 The estate is beautiful  well located a 10 min drive from beaches and ideal if you wish to head into Corfu Town in the evening approx 20 min drive (transport essential). The treehouse is super cute and tranquil  we loved sitting out on the balcony at sunrise and sunset. Breakfast is amazing and the resident dogs are friendly. If you are a light sleeper it is worth bearing in mind it is quite noisy with animal noises overnight in the treehouse!
14200662,Myriam September 2022 I have travelled a lot around the world but I have never stayed at such a beautiful place. The treehouse is beautiful  I loved the interior design and the simple but lovely details. The breakfast is delicious and perfectly served. I absolutely recommend it! Jorija is a wonderful host  very kind and helpful. The whole place is in a beautiful surrounding  perfect to relax and have a great holiday! Thank you so much Jorjia and Team! I hope we meet again!
14200662,Annalisa August 2022 Very beautiful and suggestive location  very silent and relaxing. It is required to have own or rented vehicle though. Host was very kind and eager to help with recommendations
14200662,Lamine August 2022 One of the best places i have never been in my life  nothing more to add.  Thanks for Jorjia and the good breakfasts that she provides.  Lamine & Ahlem with love !
14200662,Lilli July 2022 The little Treehouse was perfect for our stay at Korfu! We really loved it and recommend it to everyone!
14200662,Steven July 2022 Good service  cute and relaxing place to stay  clean  well equipped! (If you need to sleep in the dark  don't forget to bring an eye mask. Room has quite some light coming in  in the morning.
14200662,Sonja June 2022 The Treehouse was a wonderful place to stay  it's so cosy and romantic and we had a very relaxing time there. The breakfast we've got was so delicious and included a little surprise every day. And I already miss the cute and friendly dogs who came everyday to visit.
14200662,Patrick June 2022 Jorjia is very kind. The accommodation was exactly as described. Clean and sweetly furnished.
14200662,Jade June 2022 Such a great place to be. Really relaxing and beautiful scenery all around. The hosts are super friendly and they even made us a special vegan breakfast. Amazing food!
14200662,Carmen May 2022 The tree house is a gem. It is comfortable  nicely decorated and so peaceful. Located in the heart of nature  it's truly soothing and quiet.
14200662,Alicia May 2022 It was a fantastic experience and we liked it very much. It is possible to book breakfast which we can recommend. It looks like the pictures and waking up in the tree house is dreamlike. The hospitality is also great. The resident dogs and cats are very friendly. We are already looking forward to our next visit!
14200662,Marieke May 2022 We’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s  but this one was by far the best one ever! The treehouse is really beautiful  the surroundings are super peaceful  the location is convenient and Jorjia is such a friendly and communicative host! And the sweet dogs that roam the property were a really nice bonus!! Book this place  you won’t regret it!!
14200662,Jan May 2022 We fell instantly in love with the tree house and the whole ranch. Jorjia is a lovely person and really helpful. The breakfast under the trees is just perfect. Already recommended the place to some friends.
14200662,Damaris April 2022 The tree house is beautifully located in the greenery  was very clean and exactly as described. Located in the center of the north of Corfu  it is possible to make wonderful day trips in any direction. Jorjia and her family are very kind and provided us with restaurant and outdoor activity recommendations. You can book a breakfast  which is very tasty. There is also a horse farm on the estate  which belongs to Jorjia's aunt. You can go horseback riding there  which we took advantage of - it was lovely. We felt very comfortable at Vradi Estate! Thank you!
14200662,Shira March 2022 Amazig vecation the most beautiful place in corfu
14200662,Ningshan March 2022 Friendly  very helpful  good communication.
14200662,Rebecca January 2022 A beautiful and stylful decorated unique place where you just can feel well and enjoy yourself floating above time and forget about the rest of the world. Surrounded by an astonishing beautiful green peaceful nature and beautiful lovely dogs and some horses dwelling freely around. Highly recommendable!!
14200662,Phillip October 2021 We had such a lovely time in Jorjia‘s wonderful treehouse. She made us feel so comfortable and she is the perfect host! We had a great and super fresh breakfast in the fairytale garden which is made with so much love and we enjoyed being surrounded by nature  her adorable dogs and horses. The house is decorated with so much love and care and everything has been so neat and tidy. We felt so cosy and we will recommend her place highly! We would love to come back💗🌺🙏🏼 Thank you so much to make our stay in Corfu to something special!
14200662,Dieter October 2021 We had some lovely days in the treehouse. Jorjia is very friendly and offers an amazing breakfast.
14200662,Graham September 2021 The Treehouse is such a cool place to stay. Sitting on the balcony was just amazing. The peace was quite deafening. The bed was super cosy and the air-conditioning worked a treat. Loved the dogs and cat and goose and we fed the fat rat. Jorgia gave some great recommendations for visits and restaurants and beaches. It’s a must if you want something different that has class written all over it.
14200662,An September 2021 Loved the location in the Mountains of Corfu and Jorjia was a perfect Host! We felt very welcomed! I would recommend going there if you love some peace and quite and go off the beaten path a bit. You can reach every sightseeing spot with a car. And the breakfast was very good plus there was a suprise dish every morning. You can feel how much heart she puts in her Bed&Breakfast.
14200662,Felix August 2021 If you are looking for a dreamy vacation spot in one of greece’s most beautiful islands this is the right place for you. The location allows you to get to several spectacular beaches in a heartbeat. Having some form of transportation is necessary. (I would recommend a scooter). Once you’ve reached vradi estate you have everything you need to relax. Also the breakfast that Jorjia and her sister provide is the best start for an adventurous day. If you love nature and a quite spot away from the touristic areas don’t hesitate to choose this. (All the cute dogs are just the cherry on top )
14200662,Fabienne July 2021 Jorjia is a really nice and friendly host. You can ask her everything and she’s always wants to help you!
14200662,Antje July 2021 We had a great time in the tree house. It’s a magical place and the location is perfect to explore the island (scooter or car is needed). The tree house is also very clean and very well furnished. The breakfast Jorjia makes is super delicious and with a lot of attention to the detail.
14200662,Kim July 2021 Loved the tree house  loved the view into the greens when we woke up. Nice and wonderful breakfast with vegan options and a lot of cute dogs.
14200662,Abhinav May 2021 Great place  very peaceful and tastefully designed. I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely return.
14200662,Juliette January 2021 Our stay at Jorjia was really great. The cabin in the tree was super cute and all the attention  the advice  the service  the place and of cou te e the people were amazing. Don’t hesitate to have a stay here !
14200662,Linda October 2020 Wow - what a beautiful stay we had at the treehouse. So magical and romantic! Really nice amount of privacy but on the farm with access to freshly cooked breakfast and the wonderful horse stables next door. Honestly the best accommodation in Corfu!
14200662,Jude October 2020 Amazing place where I would definitely stay again  it exceeded all our expectations!
14200662,Luca September 2020 The Treehouse is nicely decorated and offers a comfy atmosphere. The whole estate has a really quiet  relaxing and natural flair. Jorjia was always present and had very good travel suggestions. The breakfast she and her sister made was delicious every day! When there’s a storm or just rain it’s a little loud. The first night we felt cold but we got an extra blanket for the following nights :)
14200662,Tanya September 2020 The treehouse is just as magical as the pictures show it to be. There are nice touches dotted around the house that bring the feel of nature inside as well as outside. The space itself is like a self-contained studio  with everything you’d need - kitchen (fully-stocked)  bed (bedding and towels provided)  bathroom with shower (warm shower  shower products  hair dryer) and toilet (no throwing toilet paper down the toilet  so you’ll have to use the bin and then dispose of the rubbish yourself). There is no aircon  but a fan is provided and we never found ourselves feeling too hot. There’s also a balcony with a nice view of nature  and a vegetable patch which guests are able to pick from (unfortunately there were no ripe vegetables during our stay). The place seems to attract a lot of mosquitos but there is mosquito repellant provided. At night time there was a rat in the branches above the balcony  but when you get over the fact that it’s a rat  it was actually kind of cute.  There are lots of animals roaming around the property and they are super friendly. The horses are enclosed and like a stroke. And if you’re friendly back to the cats and dogs then they will pay you a visit at the treehouse. As a dog lover  that was the highlight of my trip!  The area is up a mountain and quite secluded  so if you’re not up for long walks then your best bet is to hire a car. Taxis take long to arrive and can be expensive. If you’re happy to walk to places then the surrounding area is stunning and you can find restaurants/beaches about a 30-45 min walk away. Jorjia does provide breakfast for an extra €10 a day  but we didn’t get a chance to try it as we wanted to explore the different places nearby.  We enjoyed our stay and miss the dogs! Show more
14200662,Melissa September 2020 Outstanding treehouse  so quirky and something different  the grounds are also so beautiful and scenic. Georgia is super helpful and the breakfast is beyond delicious. Could not recommend this place enough  so romantic! The 60 needles restaurant which is approximately 3km away recommended by Georgia was also outstanding  we have theee most magical long weekend break and definitely plan to return in the near future
14200662,Amaryllis August 2020 A lovely getaway in nature and unique experience! Thank you Jorjia :)
14200662,Maria July 2020 We had the pleasure of staying in the treehouse and the Aframe which are both finished to a very high standard. The farm was truly lovely and we had the best stay. Communication was great and everyone is very helpful and welcoming. I would love to come back. Obviously due to its location a car is required and I would recommend bug repellent.  The breakfast was also some of the best we had enjoyed on the island.  Thanks again for the unique experience ☺️
14200662,Nieves July 2020 We had a wonderful stay at Jorjia‘s place. She‘s a wonderfully warm host and the family business is run with a lot of love. The tree house is beautiful with thought through details. Really a place  where you like to stay for longer. The breakfast  which is served at additional cost is totally recommended. We had it every single day that we stayed there. Communication with Jorjia was uncomplicated and she helped us with organising a scooter to get around. Eventhough its not by the coast its a great place to stay because its beautiful and the sea is only 15 minutes away by scooter.
14200662,Ryan October 2019 Our stay in the Treehouse was awesome  the location is so serene and peaceful and the treehouse is cosy with lots of lovely touches. The friendly dogs were a treat to come home to and the breakfast alone is worth staying here! Really accommodating with our late check-in and Tzwrtzia gave us some great local recommendations. For a break from hustle and bustle it is perfect.
14200662,Toral October 2019 Cannot praise this place enough. Lovely  well thought out space with all the amenities you need. Breakfast is offered at an additional cost  and absolutely delicious.
14200662,Joni September 2019 The treehouse is located in the centre of the island  what is very handy when you rent a car. Everything is nearby and you can easily visit all the beautiful beaches in Corfu. The treehouse is very cosy but it has everything you need. When it's raining and you want to sit outside you can even sit under the treehouse it self and listen to the rain.
14200662,Barbara September 2019 This place is a true gem! The treehouse is perfect. Waking up here and going go sleep here is heaven. We loved it so so much! Even the shower was the best. The property is so beautifull  the breakfast perfect and just how we like it. The animals are so sweet and will come and greet you every now and then. The best place to stay on Corfu! We will defenitely come back. Thank you  thank you  thank you!
14200662,Matt August 2019 Great quaint little treehouse for those looking for something unique and away from the tourist areas. Amazing host and hospitality. Nothing but a positive experience
14200662,Andrea July 2019 You will fall in love with this treehouse - if it’s not the friendly dogs  the neighbourhood cats or the horses nearby. You will surely love coming home to the starry sky after an adventure. The hostess was very kind to us  even booked a car for us to pick up when we landed at the airport. Very flexible with check inn/out  we appreciated that greatly. If you want something private and cozy this treehouse is for you!
14200662,Rebekka July 2019 My husband and I stayed in the treehouse for a few nights while on our honeymoon. It was cozy  private  and a fun  unique space. There is also the option to have a very nice breakfast at the guest house nearby. It is conveniently located to reach nearby beaches and Old Town. We can only recommend this place!
14200662,George July 2019 Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the tree house. Me and my partner stayed for the first 4 nights of our holiday in Corfu! We were met by one of the family members who showed us to the tree house (we were initially met by 4 furry friends who were very friendly  a dog lovers dream!). The tree house itself was very clean and had good facilities (excellent WiFi too!). The surrounding area was full of nature and at night the starry sky was mesmerising. Even though there is no a/c we were never uncomfortable as there is a fan provided and the balcony door can be left open in the day to allow Circulation of air (there is a fly net/catcher to stop bugs coming in). At night it can get cold so make sure you use the provided blankets. I would definitely recommend hiring a car if staying here as it is up a great hill from the main roads and the surrounding area is very rural. The family put together some great recommendations of things to do  places to go and restaurants to eat at. The breakfast was the best we had in our trip to Corfu (cost of 7.50 euros) with fresh local bread  fruit  honey and yoghurt (after there are eggs and bacon!). A truly magical place to stay looked after by a very friendly and attentive family. Would 100% recommend and stay again. Show more
14200662,Geraldine June 2019 A super location for anyone wishing to find peace and beauty in nature.Wonderful owners who put real passuon in to providing a unique experience for the guest.Attention to detail the accomodation offered include cottages and a wonderful tree house beautiful features and comfortable bed and lots of lazy hammocks to rest in while you listen to the owels.Quite perfect.
14200662,Nina June 2019 We loved staying in the tree house and their property generally is just lovely. A peaceful retreat from the the resort towns of Corfu but close enough to get everywhere. Jorjia  her sister and father were very friendly and helpful hosts. The space was cosy  clean and stylish with lots of thoughtful touches. We hope to visit again one day!
14200662,Freek May 2019 If you want to escape the standard hotel vibe and experience something truly unique  this is the place to be. Peaceful vibe and one of the best hosts ever experienced. Also a list of good restaurants and things to do in the area makes this a superb place to stay.
14200662,Konrad May 2019 We really loved our stay at the treehouse. As soon as we saw it we fell in love with it. And it is exactly as the pictures show. Furthermore the place itself was so nice as well. Just a bit of the touristic places  so quiet and peaceful. And we were offered to have breakfast at the estate. Which was so great and lovely made.
14200662,Sabrina April 2019 This place is amazing  very quiet and a dream to live in. The tree house is very comfortable and of high standard and very sophisticated furniture. Great architecture and decoration. It is located right in the middle of the island and it's perfect to go and explore Corfu from there. The Vradi family is extremely nice and welcoming.
14200662,Soraya April 2019 Jorjia is an excellent host  very hospitable  communicates regularly and speaks great English. Accommodation: what you see is what you get. Clean  nicely decorated  very rural. You'll hear some animals at night and it's very dark so be sure to have your phone/torch charged. Great for stargazing. Bedding and towels smell amazing! Ideal location if travelling with a car. Pretty much 30mins to the north east and west and 1-1.5hrs to the south of Corfu! Lots of parking available. 60 Needles is a restaurant about 5mins drive away recommended by Jorjia. We arrived late and staff were very accommodating  food is good and very cosy inside!
14200662,Dominik October 2018 Georgias treehouse is the perfect place to be! Only topped by her very helpful guidance!
14200662,Niels October 2018 Lovely unique place! Strongly recommended!
14200662,Dustin September 2018 The location and property are perfect if you want to be away from the city. There were a few negative issues which include the bed not being comfortable and rodents can be heard all night from sunset to sunrise crawling on the roof and dropping acorns. It is very loud and will wake you up multiple times during the night. The biggest issue is that during the afternoon and night the tree house blinds are 100 percent see through. Everyone parks approximately 15 yards from the tree house and they can see perfectly into the tree house. There is zero privacy unless you are in the bathroom or shut off every light. Besides those issues we had a great time and really enjoyed all the animals on the property.
14200662,Zoë September 2018 We had a wonderfull time in the treehouse. The host gave us a lot of tips what to do.
14200662,Polina September 2018 Really great place! The house offers a very different experience  it is totally worth it. It is very stylish and cozy and we felt as if it was our home. The area it private and quiet. Actually the only thing we could hear during the night were the squirrels which was so cute and authentic. Georgia is also very nice! She had left bread and water in the fridge for us which was very thoughtful. 👌🏻 I totally recommend this house!
14200662,Rosy August 2018 This is a really pretty place which has been put together with a lot of love & care. A peaceful hideaway but easy to drive to shops and Georgia recommends some lovely beaches on the island away from the most commercialised. Only 30 mins to the Old Town which makes a great contrast - next door the horse trekking for 50 euros in August is well worth it for horse lovers but book ahead. Just a great holiday in a super place!
14200662,Julia August 2018 We had the most amazing days on Corfu. Georgia was a wonderful host and thought of everything. She gave us a lot of tips where to go. We enjoyed our stay at the tree house and will definitely recommend it to friends and family 😊
14200662,Kasia July 2018 The treehouse was unreal. It's tucked away on a horse farm that Georgia's family owns and runs. There are several AirBnB options on the farm that the family rents out  and even though the cottage and treehouse are fairly close to one another  privacy and noise were never issues! The horses were visible from our balcony and the front door of the treehouse. They roamed around an enclosed pasture in the evenings  which gave us an opportunity to get fairly close to them and watch them graze. There are also several dogs and cats on the property that are super fun and friendly. The location is also close to the Corfu Donkey Rescue  which I also recommend visiting. We adopted a donkey during our stay ;) My husband and I stayed at the treehouse for our honeymoon - to help us celebrate Georgia left a bottle of champagne for us upon check in. Her hospitality is unrivaled. She was always a text message away to answer any of our questions about things to do in the area. She was even kind enough to store our luggage on the day we departed  since our flight wasn't until 11pm. Loved our stay there. I hope we can get back again sometime soon! Show more
14200662,Joan July 2018 Secluded  quiet  cool at night even without AC in June. Parking was easy. Horse riding can be an option as it is right next doors. Communication with the host was prompt and efficient. Some snacks and fruits  tea  coffee were provided. The balcony is also a nice touch. The host also provided recommendations for beaches  things to do  restaurants etc. We would highly recommend this place!
14200662,James June 2018 The tree house is cosy and is as great as the photos look. Really good location for exploring the north of the island from. Sitting out on the balcony is quite a treat; look out for the friendly dormouse in the tree! Georgia was particularly accommodating for our late arrival time.
14200662,Katharina June 2018 We had a wonderful time in the Tree House. Georgia was a perfect host. The check in and out was really easy and the communication with her was uncomplicated. We arrived on a Sunday evening and she already bought us breakfast for the next day  so we didn`t need to go to the supermarket in the morning  which was absolutely awesome. Also she had great tips for the best beaches  restaurants and nice places to visit. The Tree House had everything we needed including a whole kitchen and bathroom equipment (towels  hairdryer)  a fan and lovely decoration. Also there was a little vegetable garden in front of the house  where we could help ourselves with homegrown cucumbers  paprica and tomatoes. The surrounding area was very quiet and non-touristic  which we really enjoyed. It was a very good location to start from to explore the whole island with our rented car. All in all we really recommend Georgia's Tree House as a very special place to stay. Katharina and Arne
14200662,Dustin June 2018 Great place to stay. Has a quiet  peaceful atmosphere. Loved it!
14200662,Canela June 2018 We had a fantastic stay at the treehouse. It is a really cute place really nicely made and very clean. You would need a car to get around  but because it is somehow in the middle of the north part of the island  that helps you to be able to visit both the east and the west coast. Georgia is also very easy and friendly to communicate with and can give you many tips. Thanks for everything!
14200662,Edouard May 2018 Living in a tree is a unique experience. and we had a great welcome from our host. Great base to discover Corfu from an authentic area
14200662,Mira April 2018 Georgia's place was lovely! She was very helpful and had a lot of awesome suggestions for beaches and restaurants. The house was exactly like it looked in the pictures and was very nice  clean and quiet. We definitely recommend staying there!
14200662,Dan April 2018 We had such a great time here  2 weeks well spent. The space was welcoming  clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. Thanks to the tips or what to do  where to go and where to eat we had such a nice time in Corfu!  Georgia was so helpful  and the communication was great  even with some emergencies that we faced she was always available to help us!  I would really recommend staying here - the location is peaceful and near by to everything you could need.
14200662,Jana April 2018 The tree house is really beautiful. Exactly as shown in the pictures. We enjoyed our stay in the house and Georgia was a really friendly host. She helped us when we had problems with our car. She made some calls and organized a scooter. Highly recommended!
14200662,Fang April 2018 The tree house is very nice and Georgia is a really good and considerable person. She prepares allmost everything we need and also advices the beaches  restaurants and places to go. Unlucky  our water is not clear because out of power. She brings bottles of water for us so quickly. Definitely  we will come again.
14200662,Jan March 2018 100 % recommendation! Such a beautiful place for two  located in a very calm area. We really enjoyed our stay at the tree house. Self-constructed by Georgia's father. Simply equipped  but with everything you need and with love to the detail. Early check-in was shortly possible. We didn't meet Georgia in person  but she was always available via email. Thank you very much!
14200662,Lucie September 2017 This treehouse is the best Air BnB I have stayed in so far! It offers everything you need  but is also a very special place to stay. Easy to get everywhere around the northern part of the island by hire car from there!
14200662,Sam September 2017 I came for three days with my partner  and we had a really amazing time. We rented a car (essential!) And from there explored the whole of the north of the island  all of which was breathtaking.  Georgia was a fantastic host also  responding quickly to our small requests  and even inviting us to look in on the wedding taking place across the road! Great recommendations and a beautiful location  would love to come again.
14200662,Cyan September 2017 Great treehouse! Really felt like you were staying in the middle of a tree! But would invest in some good bug repellant. Great experience! Tzwrtzia was always quick to respond to any queries.
14200662,Yvette September 2017 Unique and lovely place to stay
14200662,Marti September 2017 Amazing house! Very peaceful and romantic stay... We are sorry to spend here only three nights... Georgia the host is very kind. She helped us to find better restaurants and beaches in Corfù! We will come back again!!!
14200662,Edouard August 2017 Beautiful treehouse inside a horse trekking place  the guests are very nice  helpful  and will welcome you in any way  recommend you great places to visit or restaurant to eat anywhere in the island. The place is very peaceful and quiet  with friendly cats and dogs  but is quite isolated inside a lovely forest area  so you definitely need a car if you're staying there.
14200662,Francesca August 2017 A beautiful experience to pass some relaxing days in the nature. The house is very clean and there is the necessary you can need. I really recommend it!
14200662,Hanna July 2017 This is very romantic and unique place in a countryside. We really enjoyed our stay. Since the cottige is in the woods you should be ready to face many different insects and animals (surprisingly almost no mosquitos though!). It is not anyways in the middle of nowhere  it is next to a parking lot of the horse stables and there is also other guests in the area so you won't be totally alone. The cottige is well equipped and Georgia is very helpful hostess.
14200662,Helena July 2017 We loved the tree house. You could find little details all over the house that add charm to this lovely place. We used the small terrace for breakfast or just to relax after a day on the beach. The tree house is a nice escape to be surrounded by nature. There's also a vegetable garden in which you can help yourself to some yummy vegetables. The location is excellent  you are well connected with a short 20 min drive from Corfu Town. There's also plenty of parking space. Our favourite beach was Palaiokastristsa which is an also short 20 min drive. You can try the Trailriders Horse trekking that is next door which is an excellent experience. Georgia is an excellent host  you can communicate with her in case of any doubt. She gave us a list of recommendations for places to eat and visit. All of them were excellent choices (better even than the ones in our little Corfu guide book) and you can have a real greek experience that is not your typical touristic place.
14200662,Stefanie July 2017 We had an amazing week! Georgia was very lovely and helpful and the communication worked fantastic. The tree house is really simple and yet comfortable and romantic. Be aware of the mosquitoes and of the heat inside the house on hot days. You should at least rent a bike to come around and get to the villages and beaches.
14200662,Henry June 2017 Beautiful location if you're looking for somewhere off the beaten track. Lovely horses and a very friendly pack of dogs. The treehouse has been done up brilliantly with some very nice touches. We loved it!
14200662,Catriona June 2017 We had a dream staying at Georgia's treehouse and instantly felt relaxed. She is so lovely and personable and made us feel really welcome. The treehouse is even more picturesque than I thought it could be  every detail has been thought about and the shower is excellent. Corgette flowers had been freshly picked for us and her sister made us delicious jam. Georgia couldn't have been more helpful during our stay. She shared a list of recommendations for beaches  restaurants and experiences / we tried as many as we could in the 4 days we had and all were amazing. I love horse riding so as well as the vegetable patch  you can see the stables in the distance through the trees from the balcony  which was a lovely surprise. The stable is owned by Georgia's auntie and I went on a 2 hour hack. If you're a rider I highly recommend! It's the perfect place to chill out in peace and quiet if you love nature. We'd love to go back one day.
14200662,Jannik June 2017 The Treehouse is a very unique place which we really enjoyed. It is furnitured very cozy and though modern. The view is amazing because you are surrounded by nature and hills. In the Treehouse we found everything we needed  even some little useful essentials. Georgia was a very friendly and helpful host and it was easy to communicate with her. All in all it was a great stay and we really enjoyed to explore the surrounding of Ano Korakiana.
14200662,Xander May 2017 Georgia is a lovely host: kind  hospitable and helpful  and the treehouse is adorable  and definitely and nice romantic getaway. That said  you must heed her advice: rent a car. Corfu is bigger than you think  and the location  though not exactly in the woods  is pretty secluded. That said  it is not too far away from a couple decent restaurants. Just  as Georgia suggests  bring wheels. All in all  a nice stay  and a most excellent host.
14200662,Marketa September 2016 What a lovely place! The tree house is slightly bigger than it looks on the pictures  so even though it is a small place  it's very comfortable. All the equipment is new and fully functional. Georgia and her father were very helpful everytime we needed something. The best thing about this place? The location! Away from crowded towns and beaches  our closest neighbour was a lovely oak tree and the most common sounds we could hear were birdsong  snorting horses and the occasional barking dog. When we wanted to go to the beaches  it was only a 40minute drive to our most favourite beach (which was not the closest one). I highly recommend this place to everyone who enjoys privacy and peaceful vacation.
14200662,Roni August 2016 The tree-house was perfect! It is bigger than it looks in pictures.
14200662,Philomene August 2016 The treehouse is perfectly located at a ranch in the centre of the northern part of the island. A great spot for hikes  horse trekking (also available at the ranch) visits to the beach  Corfu town and nearby beautiful small villages. It is a great and quiet location and the treehouse has a fantastic atmosphere. Georgia and her father (who designed  built and decorated this house together with the family and two friends) were very friendly  helpful and hospitable. When we arrived they gave us fresh water  fruit and wine in the fridge and lists with beaches  places to be and nice local restaurants. We even could use the vegetable garden with fresh tomatoes  aubergines and peppers. The treehouse is perfect for those who like a quiet romantic getaway at a non touristic part of the island.  David en Philo
14200662,Sabrina October 2022 The accommodation (tree house) and the entire property is simply fantastic. The location is super good  in the middle of nature  but still not far from Corfu City and great beaches. Hospitality  cleanliness and breakfast leave nothing to be desired. The sweetest animals are on the same page. We will be happy to come back! Thanks for everything:) Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Jessica October 2022 Fantastic experience!  Sleeping in a log cabin in a tree is any girl's dream. It's a reality here. I highly recommend the visit. Both Jorjia and all the staff took excellent care of us. Translated from Spanish  Show original
14200662,Vera October 2022 We stayed in the treehouse on Vradi Estate and it was really great. Everything very lovingly decorated  very clean  beautifully located. It was easy to relax. The horses and dogs can roam freely. Very nice. Jorjia is friendly and the breakfast delicious. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Leonardo August 2022 This treehouse was definitely the most beautiful place I've ever slept. The cottage is truly beautiful and has everything you need  the surroundings give an incredible peace and at night you can eat on the beautiful wooden terrace to enjoy the spectacular scenery between nature and the stars. The owner was really very kind and super welcoming  staying up to welcome us until 3 pm due to a delay in our flight!!! The breakfast was just amazing  made up of healthy  authentic Greek-style products. Simply put  it was a magical experience that I recommend to everyone!! Thanks again! Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Marlijn August 2022 Fun experience sleeping in a treehouse! Location is perfect  you are quickly on the most beautiful beaches of Corfu. Breakfast is tasty but pricey  fortunately you have a small kitchen where you can prepare your own food and eat on the balcony. Refrigerator that is next to the bed does make noise. Overall  had a wonderful stay! Translated from Dutch  Show original
14200662,Riccardo August 2022 It was three incredible days  far from the chaos of Corfu in August  a magnificent place Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Pia August 2022 We enjoyed the stay very much. The treehouse is a dream come true. The property is in the middle of nature  away from noisy tourism. The breakfast offered was versatile and we enjoyed it. By rental car  you can easily reach all corners of the island. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Marius July 2022 Super great ranch and the Tree House is very special. Can only recommend it. In addition  you should definitely book breakfast! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Julia May 2022 The treehouse is truly special! We really enjoyed our time there! The dogs and cats on the property are very  very friendly and the breakfast was by far the best we had in a long time. Highly recommended! We will be happy to come back :) Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Julia April 2022 What a little paradise! We had the most beautiful days at Jorjia's place in her little tree house (and with the super cute farm dogs). The yard is beautiful  the breakfast is super delicious and every day there is a small sweet surprise. The treehouse was perfect for unplugging - the idyll perfect for relaxing. All in all  a wonderful accommodation and the service leaves nothing to be desired. In addition  the location is unbeatable - we had a car and were at all the dream beaches and attractions within 30-40 minutes. Most of the beaches were even closer. We will definitely come back. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Katya January 2022 Everything was great  we had a wonderful time  the only thing was that we messed up with the weather  and it was a little chilly  but the warm blanket helped. We would love to come back in the season! Translated from Russian  Show original
14200662,Michelle September 2021 The treehouse is just like the pictures. Our check-in was possible earlier and the welcome from Jorjia was very warm. Breakfast on the first morning went to the house and was super delicious. On the premises there are some dogs and cats walking around  all of which you can pet. You have your peace in the tree house and are slightly secluded from the other accommodations. There is an air conditioner  but we didn't need it. It cools down a bit at night  but Jorjia also gave us an extra blanket right away. There's nothing really wrong with it. Just a super nice vacation! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Simon September 2021 Great place  everything as described in the details  perfect for a romantic getaway! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Kim August 2021 This house is very special. Amazingly romantic and super individual. We got a rich  free breakfast on the first morning  which could be booked for €10 per person on the other days. Recently  an air conditioner was installed  about which we were super happy. At night it gets extremely cold  so we had to give ourselves extra blankets - but everything better than not being able to sleep due to heat. The ranch is a bit remote  but everything is easily accessible by car. Don't forget Autan! The first evening on the balcony without  gave us many stings. Ohropax are also advisable  because seven-sleepers and birds make a lot of noise at night. We thought it was not disturbing  but rather beautiful. Forest just! :) We will definitely come back! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Sandra October 2020 The stay with Jorjia was fantastic and exceeded my expectations. The property is located on a larger property surrounded by nature. Despite the tree house character  the furnishing style is very upscale and even in the somewhat cooler month of October we felt absolutely comfortable. Jorjia helped us directly with questions or problems. She also prepares a great breakfast! Hopefully this wasn't my last visit! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Nele September 2020 Fantastic secluded location in the forest 🌳 In the morning  the sun shines through the trees to bed. Simply great ✨ Super nice hostess who makes a lot of effort and 4 super cute dogs who like to visit you. During the day it heats up and at night it cools down well it is best to ask for a second blanket 🙂(were there in September) What disturbed a bit was the daily mosquito hunting. Fly screens would help here 🙂Really worth the trip! Definitely would come back again 💕 Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Francesca August 2020 Jorjia's treehouse is a wonderful place  complete with everything you could need. Communication with the host is impeccable  Jorjia was very kind  she allowed us to check in at 2 am due to a ferry delay. She's the best. This vacation has changed us inside  the treehouse is an introspection place as well as comfortable and magical. We never wanted to leave you and hope to go back! Thank you with your heart Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Iryna August 2020 The house is exactly as shown in the photos. Everything is perfect  the location is strategic to go to the sea to the west and east. I highly recommend staying in this place! Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Eike October 2019 We stayed in Georgia's beautiful treehouse for two weeks in October. Truly a very special place to stay. It was great to wake up to the trees every morning in between. Georgia was great  super friendly and always there for questions. It is possible to book a delicious breakfast for €7.50/person. The first morning we go to the house. The Luna Luna d'argento is wonderfully located in a valley. The individual  all beautifully designed holiday homes are far apart and you are really alone. It is a wonderful peaceful place with many (really love) dogs  cats and horses. As a starting point to discover the island  also perfectly located. For us  it was a wonderful vacation in a fantastic accommodation. Many thanks to Gorgia   Eike and Mads Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Selina October 2019 We like to go there again. If you like animals and nature  absolutely the right place. We felt very comfortable  also because of the hostess. Super nice accommodation  lots of valuable tips and info  great breakfast. Thank you! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Patrick September 2019 We booked the Treehouse for 10 days and were looking forward to an exceptional apartment.  In advance  communication was very easy and friendly. On site  the key handover was flexible  so we arrived very relaxed after the flight and had no stress.  The tree house is just as beautiful as in the pictures and is quiet  now from trees in a complex of cottages  horse ranch and other unobtrusive buildings. Everything is harmonious and spacious.  The first morning there was a super delicious breakfast on the house  which we enjoyed very much. Otherwise  you can have cheap  balanced and super tasty breakfasts every day or take care of yourself.  Georgia itself is a super friendly  friendly and helpful host. Her tips were also great!  In addition  the apartment is perfectly located for excursions. A car is mandatory for exploring the island anyway.  Thank you for the great time! Show more Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Eva June 2019 We spent 5 nights at the wonderful Treehouse. You feel right at home  everything is furnished with a lot of love for detail. Check-in worked great  Georiga was waiting for us there despite arriving late in the evening. We especially loved the family atmosphere and the many animals around you. The 4 sweet dogs welcomed us at breakfast (without being intrusive). The breakfast was super tasty and fresh and can be booked for €7.50/person. Hopefully it remains such a special place in Corfu  with the not many guests it makes the accommodation unique. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Franziska June 2019 We spent four nights in the very cozily furnished treehouse. Ideal for relaxing! The location of the property is a bit off the beaten track  so a car is a must. Tzwrtzia welcomed us in a very friendly way and responded immediately to questions. The breakfast  which is additionally offered  is highly recommended! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Lisa April 2019 Simply TOP!  We stayed at Jorjia's place for a week and everything was perfect. The check-in was totally easy   she was always available and gave us great recommendations for restaurant visits or beaches. The neighborhood is located on a horse ranch and is beautiful  everything is green and you are surrounded by untouched nature! As an animal lover  a paradise!  We will definitely be back and can only recommend this place! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Daphne September 2018 My boyfriend and I were in Corfu for the first time and we were very much looking forward to the holiday together and our stay in the treehouse. The tree house is beautifully and lovingly decorated down to the last detail. Despite the large glass front we did not feel watched as the place is well hidden among the trees. We spent 10 days there and the space and equipment offered everything you need for a vacation. However  we had problems with the bed  which is very hard. It got unexpectedly chilly at night and we got an extra blanket from Georgia. Georgia was really very hospitable and went out of her way to make sure that we had nothing missing. In the treehouse we found a long list of tips for eating out  bars and other activities. We didn't mind that the accommodation is a bit off the beaten track and we depended on our rental car every day. The nearest beach is just 20 minutes away and easy to reach. All in all  it was a great vacation! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Aurora August 2018 Very nice apartment. I have everything I need to enjoy my vacation! Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Jörg July 2018 Fantastic place in the countryside. Everything very tastefully designed. The location is absolutely quiet. The equipment is sufficient for the limited space for two people. Functionality and aesthetics are balanced and well-solved. For us  this was an ideal place to explore the north of Corfu. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Alain May 2018 Very good property  very exotic and very nice accommodation... We are very well received and there is nothing missing... A beautiful place to know absolutely!!!! Translated from French  Show original
14200662,Christian May 2018 Wake up between leaves and branches. A great experience in the middle of nature. Equipped with everything you could ever need for a short vacation. A little secluded  but without a car it's not easy in Corfu anyway. A real recommendation!! Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Hanna May 2018 Very very nice and unique place to stay. We explored many places on the island by car and saw little comparable cozy-authentic and tasteful inns. We like to be in the treehouse every night.  We only stayed a week and were out and about during the day. The size of one room was just right for this.  Fruits and ingredients were available for the first breakfast (toast  honey  coffee) to welcome you. Towels and bed linen have freshly washed. The bed was heavenly. We like firm mattresses and slept really great and the treetops.  Georgia has consistently inquired about our well-being and was quick to respond with tips and hints. Due to its proximity to the equestrian center  we have also seen Georgia almost daily on the premises where it is available to guests. We felt welcome and well accommodated at all times. Key handover and on or departure were extremely straightforward  on time and quickly done!  Just to the location: Ano Korakiana is a traditional mountain village. Directly in the neighboring village of Karo korakiana there are 2 really very good taverns and from there it is also not far to the sea. In itself  Abo Korakiana is a really convenient starting point to explore the north of the island  the highest mountain  the most beautiful beaches of the island and Corfu town. Car is mandatory  but in fact everything is very quick to reach. Only for the trip to the south you should plan a day trip.  I would return to the treehouse anytime. A warm recommendation to all Corfu travelers :) Show more Translated from German  Show original
14200662,Federica October 2017 We stayed in the treehouse in October. The place is very nice  even the island. Giorgia's recommendations were very helpful  especially on the restaurants where we ate very well. The house is clean and comfortable  the owner is very helpful. Translated from Italian  Show original
14200662,Stefan October 2017 We were already fans of Corfu and our stay in the tree house enhanced this  what a vacation feeling ; wonderful ! The location is really perfect if you like to explore in Corfu  we also recommend everyone  so many beautiful beaches  walks and good food  each direction has something to offer  so different and so beautiful  thanks !! Translated from Dutch  Show original
14200662,Janine September 2017 The treehouse is very special. It was furnished with a lot of love for detail  but also the architecture of the house in general is detailed. Especially the many windows make the treehouse an experience. If you're looking for something different  this is the place to be. Translated from German  Show original
14200662,George July 2017 The experience in the Treehouse was unique for Greek data. A full house on trees- in the midst of nature. The house had it all like a normal studio in the city. The peace of this residence was unique. The balcony was unique as well  which is on the left side of the treehouse. In the evening the house is very cool( many times it needed a sheet or blanket) except for 2 days that we encountered in a large heat burner (it had 13 years on the island )and made the stay a little more warm . This home is suitable for people with a different attitude of vacationing to nature lovers; itwas a better stay thanks to the very nice and accommodating host of Georgia. Definitely when we return to Κέρκυρα we will stay in one of your awesome houses. Translated from Greek  Show original
14200662,Hugues September 2016 Unusual and exotic experience with this house under the trees. The hospitality was excellent. Translated from French  Show original
14200662,Dimitra August 2016 It was a great experience! Our reservation was actually made last minute however Tzwrtzia was very accommodating and she immediately gave us all the information she needed. We were greeted by Tzwrtzia's father  who was just as kind and accommodating! We were surprised at the beauty of the place!!!The treehouse has nothing to be envied by a normal home!!!It was fully equipped while maintaining its character! A beautiful gesture (fruit and wine left by hosts) made a good first impression! A list of places we could visit made our stay in Cyprus easier! Thanks for everything!  I look forward to being inthis dream place again!!! Translated from Greek  Show original

42805565,Anina May 2022 The place was absolutely beautiful. Having an apartment with a private garden so close to the beach really is marvelous! The apartment was clean and everyone was very friendly. Sadly as we were staying there at the end of april / beginning of may the restaurants and mini markets close by were either not open or not stocked  so being there without a car did provide a challenge. As well as the buses ran with less frequency. Just as information for anyone planning to stay around that time of year. Regardless of this we were very happy with the apartment and especially the location  which really does seem like paradise. Response from Eleni Anna May 2022 We were so happy to greet and meet Anina and her friend as our guests in one of our properties  New Era Home 14. Easy couple and friendly  kind  respected the apartment and were easy to communicate  from even before arriving and throughout their stay. We recognize that April is the starting season of the island and might not meet their needs  but  we hope that this had not a negative impact in their opinion about the island. We would love to have these guests again  if they honor us with their choice in any of our homes. Hope to see them again  and offer them our genuine hospitality. Show more

24116811,Rick December 2022 Villa Estia is a slice of heaven  in the middle of a gorgeous resort town. The front patio is straight from a postcard — with olive trees and bougainvilleas and roses drawing in all the bird life to serenade us. We walked everywhere  but also had the prime parking spot right on the main strip. It felt like rock star treatment!  The only caution is that Paleokastritsa really does shut down completely by November. So if you’re like us  and in the mood for a retreat  it’s a beautiful experience. If you’re looking for walkable shops and restaurants  try Villa Estia in the March-to-October range. Response from Miriam December 2022 Thank you so much for your nice words :) We are very happy that you enjoyed it. And yes you are absolutely right: Paleokastritsa is very quiet after the season in October. Perfect to relax but you need to consider to make trips to Corfu Town or the local villages around:) All the best wishes and merry Christmas  Miriam Show more
24116811,Julie October 2022 What can I say? Everything was just perfect for us and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Miriam’s beautiful house. Response from Miriam October 2022 We are happy that you enjoyed it :) I would love to welcome you again. All the best wishes  Miriam
24116811,"Ya October 2022 Great  well equipped house at an amazing location!  We absolutely loved this house - everything was spotlessly clean and brand new  it has everything you need for preparing meals and there's a washing machine and dishwasher.  The house plan is very convenient for a family or for two couples - there's a good sized living room and dinning area in the middle with a bedroom on either side. Each bedroom has its own bathroom and toilet.  The view from the terrasse is just WOW!! Beautiful landscape of the sea  looks like a painting. The outside area is beautifully kept and maintained  there are flowers and olive trees. Be careful if you're bringing toddlers though as there are a lot of steps leading to the house and you need to watch them (but this is true for pretty much every other house in the area!).  The location is great - a lot of restaurants in walking distance  the beach just a few minutes away by foot. Amazing sea views all around.  We had a bit of trouble finding the house using Maps with the address provided  so I suggest using the ""full itinerary"" provided by Airbnb which gives you the exact coordinates.  All in all we had an amazing experience and will definitely come back to this house next time we visit Corfu. Show more Response from Miriam October 2022 Thank you so much for your nice words. We are happy that you enjoyed the house and area :) we would love to welcome you again."
24116811,Felicia October 2022 Amazing location and a beautiful place to enjoy the best parts of Corfu. Super nice and helpful staff that made sure we had a great time there. Response from Miriam October 2022 We are so happy that you enjoyed your time at the house! Thanks again and all the best wishes  Miriam
24116811,Lauren September 2022 An idyllic place to stay to escape to. The position is fantastic with much privacy and stunning views of the sea. The house was immaculately clean and is very spacious with all the essential items. Miriam was very helpful with recommendations and communicated very well with us. I couldn’t rate this more highly. Response from Miriam September 2022 Dear Lauren  we are very grateful for your lovely words. It was our pleasure to be your host. Thank you so much and hope to welcome you again. Best regards Miriam
24116811,Tamara August 2022 Perfect house for perfect family vacation. The arrangements with the host about booking and additional info with the host Miriam were very proffesional and on time. For every recommendation! We are very grateful.

24116811,Joanna July 2022 A wonderful villa in great location. Immaculate and well equipped. Wifi excellent. Restaurants and beaches within few minutes walk. Highly recommend .
24116811,Susan June 2022 Miriam was not available but her housekeeper  Makis checked us in swiftly and explained how everything worked. The villa location was perfect  you could walk to the grocery in 3mins + do take outs from taverna next door (very useful on those nights when you are exhausted and don't want to dress up and go to restaurants). Palaio and the villages above have many fine dining options  so make sure you search Google Map. There was a 3-level terrace  and we were grateful to lounge under the BIG olive tree and stay protected. Inside the villa  you will enjoy the minimalist design with the high ceiling and big window. It was airy  clean and bright through out. Kitchen was well equipped and huge fridge to stock your cold drinks! WiFi was fast and consistent. Lots of closet space and beds were comfy. AC was cold and quiet  a life-saver on those +30 degrees days! Private parking + well-lit stairs were big plus. Overall  the villa was a highlight for our 1st trip to Corfu. We will surely recommend Miriam's villa to all our friends and family. Response from Miriam July 2022 Thank you so much for your words! We are so happy that you enjoyed the house so much and that you love Corfu as we do. We would love to welcome you again. All the best wishes and warm regards  Miriam and Georgios Show more

24116811,Shauna June 2022 Villa Estia was amazing! Miriam and her grounds keeper Mikia were wonderful and there in a moments notice if we needed them. The pictures shown are bery accurate. As we entered it was very clean  and the patio and view were to die for. We loved just sitting outside during the sunset and taking in the view right from the patio. The assigned parking spot was a life saver also. The home is within walking distance from to several restaurants and beaches. Dont miss going up the hill to Bella Vista where I promise is the best view you will ever see! I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Miriam!

24116811,Jeremy May 2022 We had a wonderful time in Villa Estia. Excellently equipped and extremely clean. Exactly as described and is better than the pictures show. The view of the harbour when sitting relaxing under the olive trees was magical to wake up to. Paleokastritsa has a number excellent Taverna’s we eat in most of them and was not disappointed. The beaches are quite small and mostly pebbly  we hired a car and explored the island and found some lovely Beaches and scenery. We had a fabulous stay in a fabulous villa. Response from Miriam June 2022 Dear Jeremy  thank you so much for your wonderful words. It was a pleasure to meet you.
24116811,Lucie October 2021 Perfect lovely stay with beautiful surroudings. The villa has nice view 😍 We aporeciated fully equipped kitchen. We really enjoyed it.
24116811,Mary October 2021 This was our first real family holiday post Covid  and boy was it phenomenal. Villa Estia has a spectacular location and is spotlessly clean and comfortable  with every convenience thought of. It is perfectly located for the beach  restaurants  and supermarkets. We were met by the kind Makis  who made us feel very comfortable and made sure we knew everything that could be of help. Don't hesitate to book Villa Estia!
24116811,Domas October 2021 Amazing view  amazing villa  pretty much everything walking distance  recommend to stay at least few nights  as one was not enought to enjoy this place! Response from Miriam October 2021 Thank you so much! :)
24116811,Przemyslaw October 2021 We had good time at Miriam's place. It was warm and cosy throughout the day and night also a very good and reliable shower. One of the few places we've been to in Greece where you have an option to recycle rubbish. Great to see! Mosquito nets in all windows which made our stay quite comfortable.  Great views inside due to large open space and wide windows. Outside terrace with sun loungers and barbecue available to enjoin when weather allows.  All in all we had a good stay. Response from Miriam October 2021 Thank you so much for your nice words. We happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. Best wishes  Miriam
24116811,Kyler September 2021 Absolutely perfect! The villa is beautiful with a stunning view of the sea. It is very comfortable and feels high-end. Great location in Paleokastritsa! It is walkable to multiple beaches  cafes  and tavernas. It’s also an easy drive into Corfu town. The hosts were wonderful  made check-in easy  and even came to clean mid-week!  So many details that other places get wrong  Villa Estia gets right: very comfortable beds; light-blocking shades; A/C in every room that works well and runs quietly; easy parking at the villa; a well-equipped kitchen; a dishwasher (yay for not hand washing dishes on vacation!); cozy lighting in the living space and good makeup lighting in the bathrooms; high-end bathrooms with great shower heads. Every detail was perfect! I highly recommend staying here. You will not be disappointed! Response from Miriam September 2021 Thank you so much for your beautiful words. We are so happy to hear that you had a good time at our house.

24116811,Nicholas June 2021 Miriam’s villa is an absolute joy. There was not a single feature we did not love - from the breathtaking view  the proximity to all the Paleo sights and beaches  the ability to dine under tranquil olive trees - to the beautifully pristine interiors complete with every comfort and modern convenience - an absolutely amazing place! Added to that  Miriam was the perfect host  with fast communication  flexibility around check in and out times  and very detailed and extremely helpful recommendations. Thanks also to Makis the very friendly housekeeper who was on hand to help us settle in and also had some great recommendations for the area. I would 100% recommend this villa to anyone seeking a luxurious stay in one of the most beautiful parts of Corfu. Response from Miriam June 2021 Thank you so much for your heart warming words.

24116811,Antonio June 2021 We have been here in early June 2021  and fully enjoyed our stay. The house is very comfortable  with great appliances  but obviously the view and the location are 5 star.

24116811,Peter August 2020 Sumptuous residence with quick access to all beaches. The house and terrace are so gorgeous you might not want to ever leave. So much love and attention to detail put into this place- plus the hosts are super helpful. One of those rare Air B and B experiences which are even better than the photos.
24116811,Piotr July 2020 It was a wonderful vacation. The time of the pandemic caused Paleocastrisa look like after the season  despite the wonderful weather. A place with many coves and clear  although cool water is really wonderful  and the view from the dining room windows and from the terrace is like a million dollars. Near the house there is a small pebble beach below the cliff. Stores with essentials products 3-5 minutes from home. Lots of restaurants and taverns to choose from. Terrace very well arranged  shaded by old olive trees. A very spacious house with a high ceiling and efficient air conditioning  very comfortable and tastefully  fully equipped. We immediately felt at home. The hosts very obliging and helpful in planning your stay. We already miss Paleokastrisa. Thanks a lot Mitiam Response from Miriam July 2020 Thank you for your heart warming words! I am so happy that you had a wonderful holiday these special times  best wishes Miriam
24116811,Simon November 2019 Miriam’s place is a lovely 2 bed house which is very well equipped and has great views. It was perfect for us and our two children (12 & 13 yrs).  While the description suggested that the local beaches are just “a few meters” away  in reality the nearest accessible beach is 1km away. This was something of a disappointment to us as proximity to the beach was a major reason for selecting the house.  We arrived in late October  and it’s worth noting that the local town was virtually closed down for the winter with most of the restaurants and shops closed.  It was our first time staying on the west side of Corfu  and we loved the rugged scenery and quiet beaches! Response from Miriam November 2019 Dear Simon  thanks for your feedback and for being our guests. I am happy that you liked the house and enjoyed your stay. I am so sorry that you did not contact us during your stay. I could have helped you finding open places during the winter season  especially preferred by the locals. Most bookers in Oct./ Nov. are looking for the silence in the postseason  so I was not aware of your thoughts and expectations :) and regarding the beaches  Akrotiri Beach f.e. is in 450 m walking distance and all the winter reachable. The Platakia Beach and Verderosa Beach  which are not accessible in winter as they are very small  are also about 450 m away. So the main beach Agios Spiridon is 950 m away. I am very sorry that this was more far than you expected but it is not 1 km minimum from our house to reach a beach and swim :) All the best wishes  Miriam Show more
24116811,James September 2019 We loved our stay   easy check in   all new renovations and furniture . Spotlessly clean and a great location - really nice swimming which is about 100 m walk from the house . Car parking is great and a must on this location . We cooked at home a few nights the kitchen is all new and fully equipped   restaurants are all with in a few minutes level walk. We would stay again ! Miriam is great to deal with.
24116811,Bill September 2019 This is a most lovely villa with everything you would need for a relaxing stay. There are premium kitchen and laundry appliances  air conditioners  wifi  bathroom showers and spacious living areas ( with outdoor shower too). The patios overlooking the exquisite bay are just perfect  under olive trees and well landscaped garden. We also loved the herbs growing in the gardens - a lovely addition to our cooking for our guests.  We had a most wonderful stay and highly recommend Villa Estia.

24116811,Siobhan August 2019 Villa Estia was a beautiful spot with probably the best views of the bay. Everything was spotlessly clean and the beds were really comfy. Your prompt communication was really appreciated as it gives confidence when making bookings via Air BnB. Check in was simple and exactly as per the instructions and we really appreciated the late check out was possible for us. The location within the resort was perfect as we were able to walk to all the beaches and restaurants. We stayed in August so the resort was very busy so it was great to be able to get back to the Villa to relax and enjoy the views at the end of the day. Response from Miriam September 2019 Dear Siobhan  thanks for your nice words :) it was a pleasure to have you guests and I am very happy that you have spend a good time in our house and in Paleokastritsa.

24116811,Anne July 2019 Villa Estia is a beautiful place located in Paleokastritsa  a little village approximately 30 minutes west from Corfu town. It has a great view and is located close to many beaches and a few bars and restaurants. The bungalow is spacious and has great facilities as well as a great host. Miriam was available the whole stay  and provided local tips. I recommend staying here as it was quite and nice  not too “touristy”. There are several car/bike/boat rentals with good customer services and that way we got to see the best of the whole island. We drove both north to Sidari and East to Ipsos to see the beautiful nature  and of course we had a guided trip to some of the gorgeous caves alongside the coast of Paleokastritsa. Response from Miriam July 2019 Thank you Anne for being our guests:) we are happy that you enjoyed your time in Paleokastritsa
24116811,Philippe July 2019 Great house in a great location. Lovely view  and very comfortable.
24116811,Dustin July 2019 This place is awesome! It’s within walking minutes from one of the best beach areas of Corfu. You can go to three different beaches in between the mountains  rent a boat  paddle boards... there is a very nice restaurant Vigla right next door. This was our go to for breakfast and other meals. Some very nice restaurants overlooking the water nearby too. You can see the water from the patio as snow in the Picts. The place was clean. They met us near midnight to let us in and show us the house. Very nice hospitality Response from Miriam July 2019 Thank you for your nice words and feedback :) Would love to welcome you again!

24116811,Nancy September 2018 Villa Estia is a very beautiful summer home with everything you need. The views are spectacular! There is so much to do all around you and in walking distance. There are many beaches and restaurants to choose from. I couldn't be happier with my decision to cancel my hotel in Corfu Town and spend my vacation in Corfu at Villa Estia - it was the BEST decision I made. We ended up renting a car and it was very easy to get around the island to see everything! If you are visiting Corfu  I highly recommend you stay at Villa Estia - it won't disappoint you! Thank you Miriam for opening up your summer home to us to enjoy! I hope I can enjoy your villa again in my future travels.

24116811,Inga May 2018 The house is just really nice and very cozy and tastefully decorated. There is plenty of closet space and two really good bathrooms. The kitchen is excellently equipped. A large refrigerator  a separate freezer compartment  plenty of glasses  dishes and cutlery and then an easy to use dishwasher. The washing machine is also easy to use and is in the kitchen. Kitchen  living area (with fireplace and TV) as well as the beautiful dining area with wooden table merge  so the room is very spacious. The two bathrooms can be reached in each case through the appropriate bedroom. One bathroom has a bathtub  the second has a nice shower. Hot water is available quickly. The bedrooms each have patio doors to the outside and two very comfortable beds each. Everything has been thought of - all windows and patio doors have mosquito nets that you can easily open and close if necessary  the wifi is fast and easy to connect. The outdoor area is equipped with a large table and comfortable chairs and four cozy wooden loungers. A patio door leads outside from the living/dining area. From here you have a great view of the bay with the crystal clear water and the swimming spots within walking distance. The two large olive trees on the terrace under which you can dream the day wonderfully on the loungers in the shade are also particularly pleasant. Right next door there is a simple  nice restaurant where you can have a great breakfast or a small snack. Several good restaurants are within walking distance of the property in the evening. We enjoyed the stay very much and certainly were not the last guests.

51740229,Winifred October 2022 Loved our stay here! The house is new and immaculately set up. We had everything we could need and more! The pool was amazing  and beds etc all very comfortable. Loved Liapades  we hired a car and found that gave us a lot more freedom. The area nearby is great  but as we came at the end of the season many places were closed. Giannis was fantastic at giving us recommendations and places to go. Definitely recommend.
51740229,Philippe October 2022 The welcome was perfect  nothing is missing in this little house for you comfort. Tea coffee sugar Olivia Oil  Plugs … The position is very Suntra and you can visit the fall island within one hour from there. Nice place to stay with family or friends.
51740229,Alex & Dina October 2022 We spent 4 days at The Stone Villa and it was way too short. Our stay was just perfect!! The communication with Flora and the check-in was spot on! AND the villa is a true gem!! It had everything you dream of! We were welcomed with some fruits  wine  milk  bread and water. What a hospitality!! I would recommend this gem to everyone! You won’t regret it!
51740229,McKinley October 2022 Flora and Giannis’s place was amazing! The location and view was beautiful! It was in a quiet quaint neighborhood with amazing views. Giannis  Flora’s son was so kind to come and meet me and my friends upon arrival. He showed us all the houses amenities which included portable WiFi  plug converters  food and wine provided  etc. Out of all the airbnbs I stayed in during the trip  this one felt like home the most and was so comfortable to stay in due to so much being provided! Giannis also was very helpful with luggage  was easy to contact  and gave great suggestions on restaurants and beaches in the area. I also had a medical emergency occur while on the trip and was on crutches. Giannis helped me get up and down stairs to the place. I cannot thank you enough for the hospitality Giannis! We will be back!
51740229,Hanna October 2022 Amazing villa with lovely views in a convenient location. The host was incredibly helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we need. The facilities in the villa are top notch and the overall design is very beautiful.
51740229,Kévin October 2022 Such an incredible stay in Villa Di pietra !  The villa was more than conform comparing what you could see on profile.  Indeed  Flora did made everything to make us confortable like if it was our own house !  + : Owner's availability (First  because we had some trouble in our travel (flight delay  ...) and the owner was really patient and wait for us ! Second  because all stay long the owner recommended us some good places to see  visit  ...) Good location (supermarkets  ATM  restaurants  beaches  views  ...) Villa REALLY full equiped (dishwasher  washing machine  oven  tv  ...) Pool is private and offer a real good view ovre the city Carpark (no trouble about timing  place  privacy or whatever. It's inside the villa)  - : Probably some people reading this comment will think i'm exaggerated  but i really don't know what could be the minus points for this villa... Sorry :D  Thanks again to the owner beecause we had a really really good stay and we will for sure come back ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !  Kévin. Show more
51740229,Jayne September 2022 We stayed for 1 week- absolutely faultless! Brilliant location- close to supermarket and restaurants Villa itself was spotlessly clean- all high quality furnishings and everything you would need for the kitchen. flora has thought of everything! Very comfortable bed- again spotless- we slept so well! The infinity pool was pure heaven- we spent many an hour watching the world go by! We felt so relaxed and the whole stay was absolutely faultless Excellent communication between Flora/sons- all questions were answered very quickly! On our arrival Flora showed us around snd left us some food gifts which were well appreciated. Air Con= excellent We recommend Costas Steak house- Green bus to Corfu town- 2 euros 🤷🏼‍♀️ We would definitely return! Thank you flora ❤️
51740229,Adam August 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Flora’s villa. It was perfect for our party of 3-5 guests with plenty of space and everything you could possibly need for a relaxed week away.  The outdoor area of the villa was our favourite part - a lovey pool  plenty of space to relax and areas of sun and shade all day. Inside the villa was well equipped  clean and simple.  There is a small mini market  plenty of restaurants and 2 gorgeous beaches within walking distance. We would recommend Village Diner  Costas Steak House and Marineris were our favourites.  The villa is set back from a small road which can get quite busy as local visitors make their way to Limni beach off the beaten track. This didn’t bother us as the pool provided perfect people watching perspective but might put somebody off.  We would 100% make a return visit to the villa and I have already recommended the place to friends and family.  Flora and her two sons were perfect hosts with excellent communication. and any small issues were dealt with very quickly. Show more
51740229,Jules August 2022 A beautiful oasis with stunning views. Flora and her family looked after us with great kindness and went out of their way to help us and guide us around the area. We had a great time!
51740229,Cara August 2022 We absolutely loved our stay at Villa Di Pietra. We had the pleasure of staying for two weeks and felt like home away from home! Hugest thanks to Flora  Chris and Jannes for making our stay such a special one. From fresh veggies from the garden to cleaning the pool every day we loved our time and will definitely be back. Our girls just loved the pool and spent hours playing in it  great family time! Liapades is also a very special town with fantastic tavernas and beaches all within walking distance!
51740229,Ian July 2022 Lovely villa  lovely host family and a lovely location. From the start  our stay with Flora could not be faulted. To be met after dark by Flora and her youngest Son Christopher was very welcoming. Straight away upon our arrival we could see  the villa was clean   tidy  well equipped and the accuracy of the description was true. The pool is an ideal size and very welcoming after a day exploring. The air conditioning is modern and easy to use  reducing the temperature down to a comfortable level  which allowed for sleeping easily at night. Liapades is a wonderful location with two local beaches and numerous more and attractions a short drive away  tavernas and bars to cater for all tastes. As airbnb hosts ourselves we knew the standard to expect and we were not disappointed. Would recommend this villa to other guests and an sure this will become a popular destination for all.
51740229,Tim June 2022 Amazing place and great location to beach and local restaurants. Flora even gave us some vegetables from the garden which we used on the bbq. Would highly recommend!
51740229,Jack June 2022 Highly recommend! Villa was modern  stylish  very clean and well equipped with all the essentials. The patio and pool area is perfect  with views over to the mountains and a lovely sunset view. The gardens are well maintained with herbs and lettuce to pick from. Very good location  shops  tavernas and a cafe a short walk away. The beautiful Rovinia beach a 10 minute walk away. Flora and her family are all perfect hosts  quick to respond  friendly  kind and it is clear to see they are very hard working. We stayed with a 9 month old baby and had a great time. A cot and baby bath seat were provided.
51740229,Felice June 2022 Villa Di Pietra is very well designed  well equipped  and tastefully furnished. Muted colours and clean lines. Infinitely better than everything else we could find on Booking.com in the same price range. It's perfect for two couples or a couple with two pre-teen children. The pool is small but very well maintained and just right for small children or a quick plunge to cool off. The family plant and maintain the grounds which are thoughtfully planned and meticulously kept. Liapades is a good  central location with a few restaurants and bars  a couple of small groceries  and a lovely beach just down the hill from the town  and the townspeople we met were friendly  generous and helpful. As for Flora and her family  you could not find better hosts. HIGHLY recommended.
51740229,Andrea October 2021 We had a great time in Flora's beautiful house. We felt very comfortable  didn't miss anything and had a wonderful holiday. Giannis  her son  is always available with help and advice. The house is super clean  as well as the pool  the garden and the terrace. It is spacious and built and furnished with a lot of love. We can definitely recommend it.
51740229,Gemma October 2021 We arrived at Villa de Pietra on the 2nd of October and were given a brief tour by a young boy. The villa is large and spacious with an open plan kitchen/diner/living room. Both bedrooms had ample storage space with the master bedroom having an en suite. The beds are quite firm - but this may be because we have memory foam at home so not used to a firmer mattress.  We arrived to bottled water in the fridge (no local olive oil or olives for us as the previous reviewer had been greeted with  which is fine but always nice to be greeted with some treats :-))  The pool outside is lovely and clean but very cold if the sun isn't out. This didn't deter or stop our two children from spending many hours in there though!  The kitchen is kitted out with most things - I have sent some suggestions to the owners for a few extra utensils - we cooked many evenings at the villa. The washing machine was also very handy.  Lots of restaurants nearby as well as a small supermarket and the beaches are all within a short driving distance.  All in all a lovely stay - with a few adjustments this place has a lot of potential. We did feel it was maybe a little overpriced for a weeks stay however this could be down to the location which is great. Show more
51740229,Claudia October 2021 Villa was very clean  and is in a great location for walking to various beaches and restaurants. Beautifully decorated house and garden/pool with views over to the mountains. The host was very welcoming and suggested some local restaurants and day trips too.
51740229,Eli September 2021 Very nice privet house good host
51740229,Jonathan August 2021 Thank you to Flora (and her son Ioannis) for a truly fantastic stay in Corfu.  There are many reasons to stay here in Liapades - this western side of the island has some of the most beautiful beaches  which are walking distance from the villa. The villa is actually designed and built by Ioannis  with all of the amenities provided as listed and extra towels  sheets and soap for us to have a nice stay. We were even greeted with olive oil that Flora's family made themselves (!) and local wine and feta cheese  which was very kind of the hosts.  The villa is located on a hill perfectly situated between the beach  bars  grocery stores and the center of town  all walking distance so a scooter or car was not needed at all. It was easy to arrive from the airport via taxi and we had no trouble getting where we needed on foot once we arrived. There is also a scooter and quad rental shop walking distance away from the villa which we didn’t use  and plenty of food options nearby. The main Corfu hiking trail goes right through the center of Liapades (the town's name) which is conveniently close to the villa as well.  The hosts are very responsive  the pool was perfectly cleaned  and they helped us book a boat ride at the nearby beach. Check in/out is easy and they accommodated our late night arrival with no trouble. The villa is brand new and nicely furnished  has all of the accommodations we needed and even has electronic blinds so we could sleep in well past sunrise :)  Overall  the value for money is unmatched and the brand new villa is a lovely place to call home while we explored this incredible side of Corfu island. Would recommend for anyone looking for a luxurious  easy and very clean stay on the island Show more
51740229,Andrea September 2022 We arrived as a family. We really enjoyed the personal care of the host. So we learned everything we needed to know about the house and its surroundings. Communication during our stay worked out excellently. The villa is new  very nice  extremely tastefully decorated and well equipped. There's even a milk frother. The villa  the terrace  the garden and the pool are very well maintained. The house has its own parking space. The house has screens on all the windows  which we greatly appreciated. Fresh fruit  bread  butter  jam  water  milk and much more were given as a welcome. That was really great. The villa is located above a little busy road leading to two great beaches (Rovina Beach and Limni Beach). From the villa you have a great distance view. A small supermarket is just around the corner. The beaches are within walking distance. We enjoyed the stay very much and we can only recommend the villa and the host. We will be happy to come back!

Response from Makis July 2020 Thank you so much for your kind review. I am glad to know that you had a nice time during your stay  hope to see you again in the future.
49847481,Jan October 2022 We had the most fabulous time. Such a quite and peaceful stay directly at the waterfront and with sun all day! Irina and Filippos are the most kind and helpful hosts!

49847481,Melanie September 2022 This villa is totally secluded  right on the coast. Such a stunning location  with plenty of outdoor space  super comfy accommodation. You need to be fit and healthy to walk up and down the drive to get there - but it’s worth every step.

49847481,Becky September 2022 W o W!! Absolutely amazing stay here. The hosts could not have been more accommodating  Irene was very responsive before we arrived  they helped us get our suitcases to the villa  and even helped to sort our airport transfer home. The villa itself is breath-taking. We did a supermarket shop before and didn't leave the villa for the 3 days we stayed. spent the days paddle boarding/kayaking/relaxing. If you are looking for a place to completely unwind with beautiful surroundings  outstanding sunsets  then this is the place to book! Definitely will be back :) Response from Filippos September 2022 Dear Becky   We would like to thank you for your feedback regarding your stay in Villa Renata with private Plunge Pool.

49847481,Joe September 2022 We loved our stay here and will no doubt stay here again.  If you’re looking for a place in a busy town with easily accessible restaurants and bars then this isn’t the place for you.  If like us you want somewhere remote  quiet and with direct access to the sea then this is perfect.  We’d recommend buying all the food and drink you need and just hunker down. The villa has all you’ll need for a relaxing holiday.

49847481,Euan July 2022 Fabulous  Fabulous location. The villa is lovely and set in a simply stunning position. The access is tricky as stated but once you’ve driven the distance on the track and parked  then walked down the steep path to the villa you will not want to leave. The view is stunning  quiet and only the waves and the crickets as background noise almost all the time. As someone else said  once you are there you will want to spend more time there than away.  We had a 20 and 17 year old with us and they loved it as well  particularly the kayak and paddleboard which got loads of use paddling out around the viewpoint and rocks to the north and also on a trip to Agios Gordios and back one morning  which they managed OK.  Everything in the Villa matched the descriptions provided  but what stood out more than anything was Filippos and Irena as hosts. They were just brilliant  meeting us in Agios Gordios on the evening of our arrival and driving us to the Villa   parking  helping us down to the Villa with our Luggage by putting it on their 4WD and then Scooter to get it down the hill. We managed to trip-out the electric from the solar panels by mistake and they were really helpful   turning up to fix it within an hour of us asking them about it.  We cannot recommend this villa highly enough  if you like Greece/Corfu  like being away from resorts and being a bit off-grid and isolated and enjoy a bit more of a ‘Greek’ experience / vibe you will love time spent here.

49847481,Belinda June 2022 This is a wonderful  peaceful very well equipped place to stay - we all loved being so close to the sea  the kayaks and all the outdoor living space - highly recommend ! Irena and Filippos are wonderful hosts too 
49847481,Sylvain May 2022 Small house with 3 terrasses and a wonderful view all day
49847481,Sez September 2021 This place is a gem for all those who value peace  nature and a bit of an adventure. Located close by Agios Gordios but a world away. The house has everything you need for a comfortable holiday and my only recommendation would be to buy more food than planned because you will find yourself wanting to stay in more often. We had two children aged 8 and 4 who were very comfortable with the steep stairs and we all enjoyed the surrounding off-road running paths and kayaks. Highly recommended for a unique and wonderfully picturesque atmosphere.
49847481,Hakan July 2022 Filippos & Irena were very accommodating  helpful  nice and communicative. The place with the sea view was fantastically beautiful  spacious  compact and clean. The sea can be reached in a few seconds on foot.  Filippos was our superhero 😎💪 Translated from German  Show original

51029815,Taixuan Jin October 2022 The room is very beautiful and comfortable  it is also very close to the port  a very good stay experience
51029815,Kathleen October 2022 We enjoyed our overnight stay at Spiros' place. It was a cute studio apartment that had the amenities we needed for the time we were there. We were able to walk 10 minutes from the port and took a taxi to the airport (a 27 minute walk). Location was great  too. We enjoyed walking to some of the historic sites while being in a more residential area close to bar/cafes  restaurants  and markets. We had a little difficulty locating the apartment initially  although we discovered afterward that the photo showing name of the apartment on the plaque (that is received once you officially reserve the space) is listed on maps.
51029815,Simon October 2022 Nice clean place rhatvis great value for money
51029815,Kylie October 2022 Spiros’ flat is an excellent place for staying a night in Corfu. It's located near the old town and the port where the tourist spots are within 15 minutes driving distance. Easy to find a parking spot around. We also recommend a pizza place called Mario around the apartment - great food and excellent service.
51029815,Vanessa October 2022 Spiros is very friendly and helpful. In the apartment there is everything you need. We walked from the airport to the Apartment 30min.

51029815,Alexia July 2022 Amazing communication from the host and self-check in was so easy. It made our stay so easy especially since we arrived late and had to leave early. It is 15 minutes by foot from the old town and 3 minutes from the port (if you are heading to Paxos). It’s a studio apartment that is very clean and has everything you need. The shower was amazing too.

51029815,Juliana May 2022 The place is beautiful  clean  spacious and well equipped. Great shower and good bed. Kitchen very good as well. The localization is also nice  near the center and 12 minutes walk from a Lidl. The owner  Spiros  was very kind and responsive. Would definitely stay again.

51029815,Chiara September 2022 cute studio with everything you need  also the location is convenient enough to walk downtown in minutes. Two small flaws: - Thesoundproofing of the ceiling is nothing  so if the neighbors above are noisy  as in our case  you can hear everything. - It's not very airy  so the smell of a lock remains very much. overall the value for money is fair. Translated from Italian  Show original
51029815,Marius September 2022 The apartment is located in a small alley about 4 minutes from the harbor. It is nicely clean and everything you could ever need is available.

24949961,Daniel October 2022 This home was a perfect seaside break for us. It had all the necessaries even when travelling with a child  is tasteful furnished and the cleaning arrangement is thoughtful. We highly recommend it. Response from Nina October 2022 Thank you for your great review. I am so happy you had a memorable time :)
24949961,Darren September 2022 What a perfect little oasis.  Nina is a great host and has created a perfect little getaway spot. It was the first holiday for our three month old and everything was perfect. A few different places to eat nearby and the most beautiful apartment with a great garden to relax in right on the beach.  If staying for a while a car rental would be useful to explore and pick up things from the supermarket but there is a little shop for essentials and Nina has provided all the cooking equipment you would need.  We loved it! Response from Nina September 2022 Dear Darren  I am honestly so happy you enjoyed your stay. You are great guests! Thank you very much for sharing your opinion. Hope you come back :)
24949961,Marisa September 2022 Beautiful spot right on Glyfada beach! Nina was a wonderful host & was always prompt to respond. We can’t wait to return to Corfu & stay here again!!!!
24949961,Annabeth July 2022 We had an absolutely lovely stay at Ninas wonderful beach house. It is not big but the modern interior  terrase and garden and location straight on the beach was absolutely amazing. We took a bus from Corfu city which was no problem at all - only 45 minutes busride. It was amazing and we would love to come back another time. Response from Nina July 2022 Thank you Annabeth for the great helpful review. Much appreciated.
24949961,Tahmineh June 2022 Beautiful vacation and loved the house and decor  clean and modern. Response from Nina July 2022 Thank you so much for your perfect feedback .. Tahmineh Also for your private message ..magical location and island  indeed :)

24949961,Theodor August 2021 Maybe the best apartment at the Glyfada beach!!! Response from Nina August 2021 Thank you for the 5 star review!! You are the perfect guests!!!
24949961,Eddie August 2020 “A beautiful property on the best beach in Corfu” The house was immaculate  full of luxury furnishing and little details that show that the hostess really cares about her customers’ experience The place is directly on Glyfada beach  surrounded by picturesque mountains We travelled to 4 other beaches across the island and this is by far the best sandy beach around Convenient mini market next door  pool if you need it for little ones 25 min drive to Corfu Town Nina really went out her way to help us prepare for the trip  very swift replies and really helped us with every aspect of our stay throughout ..... Super Hospitable Hostess! Couldn’t have asked for more Response from Nina August 2020 Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review. I love interior decoration and hosting. It's was my pleasure having you :)
24949961,Chahira August 2020 We came here for 4 days and were sad to leave so early again! The Bungalow is perfect for 2 people looking for relaxed  cosy and charming holidays. The Bungalow is located on the beach with direct individual access to the seaside Nina was so friendly and helpfull. The place was kept in perfect cleanliness and is well equipped. Response from Nina August 2020 I am so happy you enjoyed your stay! It was a pleasure having your lovely family :)
24949961,John August 2020 Really lovely little beach house - gorgeous interior  lots of lovely little touches to make us feel welcomed (incl. wine!) - lovely garden which opens out directly onto the beach - beautiful sunsets etc. Really lovely way for the family to spend their 1st three days in Corfu. Response from Nina August 2020 I am so glad you enjoyed your stay. Hope you will come back soon.
24949961,Industry October 2019 Our stay at Nina's lovely  stylish little seaside cottage was everything we hoped it would be. With it's pretty terrace and garden metres from the beach  which is beautiful and which we had almost to ourselves as it was end of season in Corfu  the house is situated in a small beach resort  which in season would be quite lively  I'm sure  and would provide for all your needs and entertainment. As the resort was closed we were happy to venture up to pretty Pelekas (8 mins by car) where the tavernas were still open and where the food was cheap and fresh and the locals were friendly. Corfu Town is 25 mins drive away and was much prettier than I had imagined  with a wealth of bars  restaurants  shops and markets to explore. We will be back!
24949961,Andrew July 2018 Amazing place directly on the beach  wonderfully decorated  and perfect size for our family of 3. located on the Glyfada beach which is great for families as its clear  sandy and shallow for long distance. There are amenities located at the resort such as a few restaurants  mini markets  small kids pool  and watersports. Also some great destinations within 30 mins reach such as the donkey reserve  Palaiokastritsa  and Corfu old town. Even though the house shares a wall it was always quiet and the A/C worked great. Although we did not get to meet Nina  she was always quick to reply on message and left us a welcome gift upon arrival. Response from Nina July 2018 Thank you Andrew for taking the time to write this great review. You are amazing and thoughtful guests. Hope you come back :)
24949961,Leah July 2018 We rented the adjacent units which was perfect for two families - one with kids and the other not. Pictures were great but everything was better in person. Hope to be back sooner rather than later. Response from Nina July 2018 Thank you very much Leah. :) Hope you come back soon!
24949961,Olaf September 2021 The location of the house is fantastic  the garden is adjacent to the beach  and this is one of the most beautiful on Corfu anyway. The house has everything you could want and the hostess Nina has prepared some extras  we felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original

5814114,Aurimas June 2022 Beautiful house and location. Owner is very friendly and attentive. We loved staying there so much. Thank you!
5814114,Lorna April 2022 We had a great 10 days in Corfu with our 5 and 2 year old. What a pretty island. So much to see and do if you are ready to do the driving - especially central and northern Corfu. Car hire is a must! The villa has an amazing view. It is clean and the three bedrooms are huge  two with double beds and one with twin beds. Everything was clean. A few things to improve are the two bathrooms  which ideally will be replaced in future since they look a bit tired. The only other thing we wished was that the fence was better  stronger and higher  so that we didn’t risk losing our toddler over the cliff edge! The garden is not suitable for young children unless supervised. The drive up is very steep but you get used to it. Georgia and Spiros were very helpful and kind. Great communication. The outlook and the huge window looking out to the sea is just amazing. Great value villa. You wouldn’t find a villa this nice and this big in the north for the same price. Thanks !
5814114,Jay March 2022 Fantastic private apartment with a view unrivalled in the area. Perfect for that quiet  reclusive getaway. Visited out of season so the weather was not too good  but can only imagine that in the Summer the view will be timeless. Best place to stay in the south of corfu.
5814114,Maria June 2021 We really enjoyed our stay most of all because of stunning view - spent all evenings sitting on terrace on very comfy sofa  enjoying view and grilling. Villa more or less matched photos and description  however it needs a slight overall renovation. Bathrooms are highly recommended to be fixed (lights  shower)  air conditioning is not working properly in bedroom with bathroom. It doesn’t caused us much inconvenience  though worth mentioning. First couple of days WIFI wasn’t working well  though we informed host and after some time it was resolved. The location is great  you need just 2 minutes of walking to get to beautiful beach where you can rent sun-bed and umbrella for reasonable price. It may seem too extrem when you drive to villa by car for the first time  though absolutely achievable and we got used to it. Lidl is just 10 mins away by car what was great  though local supermarket has also a decent products range. Baratos taverna - don’t recommend - unreasonable prices comparing to other places + waiter didn’t inform of couple of extra costs  dishes could be tastier. Summarizing it all: great place for beach vacation  if host makes few improvements it’ll become just perfect. We can totally recommend it! Show more
5814114,Annika June 2021 We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful located apartment with the view of the sea and the beach  which you can reach by foot within 5 minutes. The apartment is very well equipped  there are sunbeds  a beach umbrella  a hairdryer  a barbecue...There are also some nice tavernes in the village and at the beach. The communication with Georgia was super nice and easy. We would love to stay there again!
5814114,Gene May 2021 The house is located on a hill with a stunning view. Downside of being on a hill is the steep climb towards it. Outside the house is perfect with comfortabel sunbeds and a loungeset. Inside is clean but could use an upgrade. Host is nice and there was some fresh fruits and drinks waiting for us when we arrived. We had a great time.
5814114,Dylan September 2020 Perfect house  beautiful view  the house is near great taverna. We spent a great time. The hosts were very warm
5814114,Samantha August 2020 We had a wonderful holiday in the Villa  it is really well appointed with air conditioning throughout. The pictures are an accurate reflection of the property  including the views which are stunning ! Georgia met us in the village and took us up to the Villa on arrival which was helpful in learning how to negotiate the short hill. The Villa was spotlessly clean and we were regularly provided with clean towels and linen  which due to Covid-19 we swapped over ourselves. Thoroughly recommended  if you want a simple  relaxing  peaceful and rewarding holiday next to a lovely beach  look no further.
5814114,Filip April 2019 very good location!!
5814114,Adrian August 2018 - wonderful accommodation in the house - the views at the bay and beach in the morning and evening are beautiful - especially with the ouzo  greek wine and food - very nice and clean beach and water - very good 4 tavernas absolutly close to the beach with local specialties - privat/rented car very recommended
5814114,Hermann-Josef November 2017 Spiros and Georgia were very friendly hosts. We had good and fast communication and they respected our interests. In the middle of the holiday Georgia came for cleaning and changing the towels. We have been there late in October and local restaurants and supermarkets were closed. But Spiros informed us about that in advance. The house and the surrounding were exactly like in the description. There is a narrow and steep way up which ends at the two houses of Spiros in a quiet area. The house has everything available you need and a very well equipped kitchen which is untypical for Greece accommodation. We enjoyed the wonderful view from the terrace and the living room with the big panorama window.
5814114,Amélie August 2017 Beautiful house  beautiful sandy beach. We really enjoy our stay
5814114,Tibor June 2016 We had a wonderful time at Spiros and Gerogia's Villa Belle Plaza. Checking in was a breeze even though our arrival was delayed. The location of the house was ideal for us and the steep driveway to reach the house did not pose any problems (if my 70 year old mother could handle it it so will probably most everybody else). Once at the house we were rewarded with a magnificent view  peace and quiet surroundings. We enjoyed staying on the terrace which is shaded most of the day (it gets a little sun in the morning). The house was ideal for us  very clean (and kept clean by Georgia who comes to clean  change bed sheets and provide clean towels every other day)  and spacious. Beds were comfortable to all of us  three generations of family members. We kept the house cool by keeping windows and doors open and only used the AC once or twice. Kitchen and bathrooms were well supplied with all the necessary things. Shopping for food and other supplies can be done either at the small local store just at the bottom of the hill or at one of the larger grocery stores in nearby Lefkimmi just 10 minutes drive from the house. There is only one other house nearby but the fence between them provides privacy. The area is very quiet  pleasant  and relaxing both during the day and at night. Everybody was very friendly and welcoming. There are a few tavernas on or near the beach. We tried and stuck with only one of these  Meltemi  as we very much enjoyed their food and atmosphere. We did morning and evening walks in Gardenos; there is a nice 30 minute circuit on narrow roads through olive groves with views of the gardens worked by locals . The beach is wonderful and was never crowded during our stay. All-in-all a great place to relax  find some peace and quiet  and temporarily quit the rat race. We thank Spiros and Georgia for the opportunity to share their home and for being such wonderful and welcoming hosts. Hope to be back in the not too distant future.

Definitely need a car because there was nothing open nearby. Very bad either usually no WIFI in the house. Bathrooms are very dated and the Jacuzzi is so dirty we didn't use it Translated from Dutch  Show original
5814114,Vladimir August 2016 The Best view Ever!!! A wonderful expiriece amasing location and spetacular view! Every morning  you can look forward to having morning coffee on the terrace. The house is so perfectly located that you can always enjoy every second. It is cute new clean and has everything you need. Huge windows make everything feel open no matter where you are and always has a view of the best beach on the island. The beach is wonderful  sooo large and wide that even with many visitors it always seems empty. The Spiros is a super friendly host and always helpful. Fantastic holiday! Best regards to Spiros and his family. Glad to come back!!!! Translated from German  Show original
5814114,Natascha August 2016 The view of the house is fantastic. Neighbors can't be heard  it's just a house anyway. And there is no noise from the five tavernas as is the water sports during the day. Spiros is super helpful. From airport pick-up to forgotten items. The house is very clean. Housekeeping every two days. If you are looking for a quiet spot of Corfu with long  deserted beaches even in the high season  you will find it here. Translated from German  Show original
15977408,"Leena October 2022 Very beautiful villa with a very good location in middle of the island. Lots of space  a very nice pool area and a beautiful garden. The house was very clean and well equipped! There was everything we needed and lots more. The housekeepers  Oristia and Alkis  who lived downstairs  were very helpful but also very polite. Usually they were totally invisible.  We had a rented car and the location was very good for us. It was very easy to go to every direction. About 15 minute drive from airport and same time to Corfu old town. And about 15-20 minutes drive to several very nice beaches in the west coast. We didn´t try local buses  but the nearest bus stop is within walking distance from the villa. Taxi to Corfu old town (or back) for 4 persons cost about 20€.  Agios Ioannis village itself is quite small  and we visited it during the low season  in end of October. In that time  it was a rather quiet village. For example  Aquapark in the village and it´s area services were closed. But there was a good foodstore with very long opening times  a good pizzeria  cafes and a gas station. That was all we needed.  Julia and Garreth were very helpful and friendly hosts. They kept contact with us before and during the trip and gave us very useful advice. There was also a very useful ""housebook"" and lot of local information waiting in the villa.  So we had a great holiday in Corfu. A very beautiful island  friendly local people with a wonderful sense of humor and Julia's Lazy Acre villa was the perfect place for us. Show more"
15977408,Michelangelo September 2022 Simply Wonderful. I had such a great time in Julie and Gareth’s Villa. The place is wonderful  a house surrounded by a terrific garden with also a really good space to park a car (or more!)  and then the most important thing: the pool  a really good one with also a really good ‘relax zone’ near it. I mean  everything you see in the pictures of the announce is there  nothing less… but what’s not in the announce  and is perhaps the most important thing  are Julie and Gareth. They’ve been great in everything: they helped me many times  they gave me advice on what to do in the island  places to visit and even restaurants to try. We had a little problem with a light bulb during our stay and once I told them about it they immediately resolved the problem. Many many thanks!
15977408,Greg July 2022 Perfectly situated  Lazy Acre offer offers the privacy and seclusion of a hillside villa  while being close to all the amenities you could need.  The villa is spacious and well appointed  with a great pool. The air conditioning is very effective  and the property offers a great barbecue and outdoor dining area.  It’s just 12 minutes from Corfu Town and airport  and about the same to the beach resorts of Gouvia and Pelekas.  There are lots of great places to eat and drink within a short distance from cool bars  smart restaurants and traditional tavernas.
15977408,Ellie June 2022 Julie & Gareth’s place is an absolute gem in the middle of Corfu. Highly recommend hiring a car to make the most of everything nearby  although there is a bus stop nearby if needed. Julie was the most attentive host and would always reply very quickly to any queries. She kindly supplied an excellent list of recommendations for us in advance including beaches  local tavernas and places further afield to explore. Julie also helped us organise a hire car and taxis - nothing was too much trouble. The villa itself is clean and spacious  comfortably sleeping 6 people (we also had a baby with us) with lovely balconies off two of the bedrooms and also the living room (a great spot for a morning coffee!). The pool setting at the bottom of the house is stunning  well maintained and also very peaceful with 6 sun loungers and comfortable seating in the shade. We really enjoyed spending some time out here to cool off in the afternoon or have a few drinks in the evening. There are lovely  sandy beaches no further than 10 minutes away as well  plus Aqua Land water park is just up the road and worth spending an afternoon (adults included!). Overall  I would highly recommend staying here and we would return if we ever come back to Corfu! Thanks again to Julie for everything.
15977408,Jacqueline October 2021 We had a lovely stay at Julie’s place. There was everything we needed and Julie’s suggestions on beaches to go to and restaurants to visit were invaluable! We all especially enjoyed the hot tub which was a great addition in October when it is getting colder. The girls had many fun evenings in it. Thanks Julie!
15977408,Pamela December 2020 Gareth and Julie’s home is really lovely. Sadly our stay was off-season so we didn’t use the pool area but this would undoubtedly be amazing during the summer. Instead  we spent lots of time in the MOST COMFORTABLE TV room. So often AirBnB homes don’t have comfortable sittings areas - not so at Lazy Acres - best ever for relaxing and  well  being Lazy.
15977408,Nancy November 2020 An idyllic rural location  with heaps of space and a beautiful pool area
15977408,Christopher October 2020 The house is lovely  the setting and scenery are idyllic and the pool is fabulous. Also the hosts were very communicative and helpful  made us feel very welcome. There’s lots of space inside and out to relax  chill out  drink wine  cook  eat and sleep. It’s handily close to a little village too with some shops  bars and restaurants  although I’d say a car is necessary. I would definitely (and probably will) stay here again.
15977408,Maddie October 2020 Just back from an excellent week at Julie and Gareth’s place. We had an amazing holiday - Lazy Acre is a fab villa in a great location which is close to the airport  Corfu town  and well connected to other parts of the island. The villa is spacious and clean - we were only three people but had we been more there would have still been heaps of space. The pool area is super secluded and despite having trees around it  is a proper sun trap throughout the whole day. The outside seating area is a nice touch too  with a fridge by it - great for keeping beers cold! One of the best things about our stay was actually the recommendations from Julie and Gareth - they were such welcoming hosts and the recommendations of tavernas/beaches/ day trips etc really contributed to our holiday. Additionally the lovely couple downstairs were so helpful; the gentleman even gave us a lift into town when we were struggling to call a taxi one night. I would definitely recommend a car - we wouldn’t have been able to do half the amount of exploring we did without one  so whilst there are buses and taxis  a car is pretty vital I would say. Thanks again to Julie and Gareth for our wonderful trip. Show more
15977408,Lena September 2020 Everything about our stay at the villa was fantastic! The house in itself was beautiful  in a perfect location. Close to everywhere in a car and shops within a walking distance! The house was very clean and well equipped! The hosts were brilliant! Very fast response to everything we asked about and very accommodating!  We loved sitting on the balcony every evening watching the stars or by the pool! Weill definitely be coming back there!
15977408,Arnout September 2020 We had a wonderful stay at Lazy Acre. An ideal base to discover every part of the beautiful island. Friendly neighbor Orestia took care of the practicalities and respected our privacy perfectly. Experience of a lifetime was renting a boat in Palaiokastritsa to discover swimming in cristal clear water on the deserted beaches surrounded by a deep blue sea.
15977408,Hannah October 2019 Julie’s villa was absolutely perfect for a mini family get away. Before and during the trip communication was really easy and quick  and Julie had loads of recommendations on things to do  where to go and where to eat. The villa itself is super clean and spacious with a fab pool  would recommend a hire car so you can get around more easily but there are buses down the road. Would highly recommend Pelekas beach for a day trip and Ladokolla for a traditional Greek taverna dinner!
15977408,Maryellen September 2019 It’s certainly is an idyllic location  but it is very sparsely set up for guests. We had to buy water  toilet paper and paper napkins upon arrival . Very bad problems with hornets all over the house. I was stung twice in two days. Also no water two mornings in a row.... including check out day. No shower  no toilets  nothing! So had to depart feeling disheveled. Loved the house  but not the hospitality.
15977408,Michael September 2019 Julie is a wonderful host. Always quick respond to questions and full of advice about the local area. We had a wonderful holiday  and the villa is very relaxing and a great base/location for exploring the island.
15977408,Kate August 2019 Lazy Acre is a beautiful house in a great location. It has a private pool  which is well kept and much needed during August. There are also 3 large umbrellas for shade. The 3 bedrooms have aircon  the main kitchen/living area is large with a big dining table and has a lovely balcony overlooking the pool. All the windows have shutters to help preserve the cool  and also nets to help keep out mozzies (which were not nearly as bad as we thought they'd be). There is a good BBQ - I can highly recommend going to Corfu market to get some fresh fish to cook on it. For families with kids Aqualand is almost at the top of the road  all parts of the island are within an hour's drive (unless you want to go right to the south) and there are plenty of lovely beaches within 20 minute's drive. The host was very responsive and helpful: she gave us loads of information on places to visit and eat. Orestia and her husband who look after the place were extremely helpful and otherwise very unobtrusive. A couple of things that would make the high rental cost better value: aircon in the sitting room that can get really hot; replace the dishwasher  toaster and oven  which are getting a bit old; a small welcome pack of basics (milk  bread) so you don't have to go out straight away. Thanks again for the stay. Show more
15977408,Richard July 2019 Very easy to find. We used a combination of Julie’s instructions and google maps to “Aqualand” as we arrived from the ferry port rather than the airport. Just 15 minutes or so from the airport and a bit further from the port.  The instructions to enter the house were easy too.  We were delighted with the Villa. Very quiet  very clean and everything we needed was on-site.  The pool is super and very clean too. Lots and of shade. It was 30 degrees whilst we were there but felt cooler.  The location of the villa is great. With a car you are within 30 minutes of many places. We loved Old Corfu which was easy to get to  within 20 minutes drive or so.  We recommend Halikounas Beach for a quiet  sandy beach. We went early in the morning (left the villa at about 09.30)  despite it being the end of July the beach was quiet all day. There’s a small beach bar with sun beds at €7 per day for two beds. Great swimming  you can walk out for 100 metres or so to chest depth. Very relaxing but great for families with younger kids too.  We would definitely recommend Lazy Acre. Great value for money too!  Thanks Julie & Gareth. Show more
15977408,Amy June 2019 We had the most perfect week staying at Lazy Acre. The house and pool are well kept  clean and spacious. Julie responded very quickly to messages and provided excellent advise on the surrounding area - helpful  accommodating and kind. We will be sure to return to the villa when we return to Corfu in the future. Thank you Julie for a lovely stay - My family and I would recommend to everyone!
15977408,Matt June 2019 Julie and Gareth's villa was perfect for us; it's clean  spacious  set in a beautiful location with a lovely  private pool. It's in a convenient location on the island  a short drive from the airport and central  enabling day trips to anywhere else on Corfu. Julie gave us lots of helpful tips for our trip  and we really appreciated all of the advice she gave  as well as her quick responses! I would recommend their place to anyone.
15977408,Paul June 2019 Lazy Acre is amazing  I wholeheartedly recommend it and we will definitely come back. The place is just as nice as on the pictures! We travelled with a family of 5 and could have easily housed two or three more people. The location is great  we enjoyed the Aqualand next door. A car is a must  with it it takes around 15 minutes to the beach or Corfu City/the airport. Julie is the most caring host we have ever had and even checked the weather forecast and recommended activities based on it.
15977408,Artemisa April 2019 lovely house we enjoyed our memonts there
15977408,Dave September 2018 A beautiful house  great location and an incredibly helpful host.  Lazy acre is a great base to explore Corfu. The setting is jaw dropping  the pool is great and it’s perfectly located to get to either side of the island. A car is helpful; however the bus stops are less than a 10 minute walk away.  Julie is super helpful  offering all kinds of tips for whatever kind of holiday you like. Communication throughout was 10/10.  This was our first overseas holiday with our 7 month old son  and lazy acre was perfect for a family getaway.  The couple who live in the separate flat are very quiet and did not intrude at all.  Highly recommended.
15977408,Jessica August 2018 Beautiful villa with pool that is very well maintained. Excellent communication from Julie with lots of local tips.
15977408,Sam June 2018 Lovely secluded villa  beautiful decor and really clean. You will need a car to get out to get groceries and/or go to restaurants. There is one cafe in walking distance and it is very good. We explored the north east of the island and found some nice beaches and places to eat. Recommended the Blue Lagoon boat trip shop around we managed to get it for €30 each with the bus picking us up at the end of the road.
15977408,Jessica June 2018 This is a gorgeous villa  private and spacious with a lovely pool in beautiful surrounds. Coffee on the balcony in the morning sun was a highlight. Julie is an excellent host providing local knowledge for a special stay. It is great having the lovely young Greek couple on the same property in case you need anything  but they are totally unobtrusive if you don't. We recommend wandering to the Paradiso Taverna just 5 minutes walk away for authentic local fare. A lovely place to stay  conveniently located... we would definitely love to come back.
15977408,Jane May 2018 Perfect place to relax and enjoy peace and quiet. The pool is the making of the place.
15977408,Vjacheslav May 2018 This house is a perfect spot to explore Corfu  it is both close to everything and far away so that you can enjoy quietness at night and hear birds singing. House is big  with a lot of spaces you can enjoy  like a terrace for morning breakfast or outdoor pool. We definitely liked this house more then any other we have staid in at Corfu
15977408,Camille May 2018 We had great holidays at Lazy acre. The villa is wonderful with a swimming-pool that the children love. Julie was a nice and attentive host. Thank you very much for all. We hope we will come back...
15977408,Mick September 2017 Where do we start? My family and I had a fabulous stay at Lazy Acre. The villa and pool have everything you need. It's private and secluded yet still within walking distance of a great taverna  minimarket and the water park! It's also within about 10 minutes drive to the east and west coast beaches. Julie is a great host and nothing is too much trouble. You definitely won't be disappointed.
15977408,Georgios August 2017 Lovely villa. Exactly as in the site.
15977408,Marjolijn May 2017 Beautifull and like a dream si Nice and spacefull we had good contact with Julie ! We enjoyd our stay !
15977408,Andrew March 2017 The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15977408,Alexia September 2022 Julie was a very nice host and had lots of recommendations. Nevertheless  the villa was not up to our expectations: taps with green waste  stains on sheets  towels and cushions  air conditioning full of dust  bottom of the moldy shower curtain  gate that closes badly (we have to close it manually 1/2 days)  lots of bulbs that don't work  etc. We were very disappointed with the maintenance of this place  the price paid is not warranted. Translated from French  Show original
15977408,Dietmar October 2019 Very nice  large house with large garden and pool. Large balcony. Unfortunately  the house is a little out of the city and can only be reached by car. Generous  medium quality amenities. Recommended. Translated from German  Show original
15977408,Roberta September 2018 What can I say?! The stay exceeded expectations  Julie is really a perfect host  available and attentive to every need. The house is fabulous and really a relaxing corner  well equipped  large and clean. The terrace and pool are the highlights of this beautiful villa. The location is great for visiting every point of the island and 20 minutes by car from the Ipsos and Corfu Town nightlife. I would definitely choose this home again and recommend it to anyone who decides to stay on the island. Translated from Italian  Show original
15977408,Надежда July 2018 This is a wonderful villa clean  has everything you need! Giulia the host is helpful and responds very quickly! Our vacation was lovely! The villa is secluded whichis really great! We rented a car  this is necessary  although there is a shop and a restaurant here within a 5-minute walk. I recommend to everyone! You will really like it here! And Pelecas beach which is not far from the villa  is the most wonderful one on the island ! Translated from Russian  Show original
15977408,Esther October 2017 We enjoyed in this beautiful house. In the morning drink your cup of tea on the balcony and when we came back from the days away together in the kitchen at the large table with each other. Because we wade later in the season we did not use the pool as often because it is not heated. We felt very welcome and if there was anything we could always call. With a broken kettle  there was already a new one on the sidewalk the next day Translated from Dutch  Show original
50069151,Russell September 2022 We love these apartments and will definitely be returning. The location is great being close to lots of the local restaurants and bars and the view is amazing. The gardens and terrace are really well kept and there’s a bbq for eating in. The room had the usual kettle  toaster  hob  coffee machine  hair dryer etc but the little extras were really appreciated  like salt  pepper  olive oil  washing up liquid and brush  dish cloth  tea towels  beach towels and mosquito plug in. There was also mosquito nets on the window and a magnetic net across the door so we had little problem keeping the mosquitos out. Anastasia was around every day keeping the place tidy and lighting little burners to keep the wasps away! Looking forward to staying again.
50069151,Anna September 2022 Fantastic place to stay special touches throughout the property and amazing hosts Anastasia and Katrina are on hand if required daily   the views from our bedroom overlooking the sea and the cliffs were breathtaking and sitting out at night overlooking the moonlight on the sea was heaven ..the property is within walking distance of all the restaurants and the local beach and you can walk to the monastery within 35 minutes   the bus stop is located a few steps from the entrance . if you are looking for peace and tranquility in the midst of the action this is definitely recommended …
50069151,Svetlana August 2022 It seems to me that this is the accommodation with the best view in Paleokastritsa. We managed to visit many places in Corfu  but we always wanted to return to the cozy territory of Bougainville in order to admire the stunning panorama from there again
50069151,Brooke August 2022 Amazing location and view. Perfect stay
50069151,Marijn July 2022 The spot was perfect  we rented a scooter to see more of the eiland. Everything in and around the house was so nice. The shared garden en the lounch beds with the best vieuw of Corfu. The house itself was alsof great
50069151,Caroline July 2022 Stayed for 5 days and it was just perfect! It’s just up the hill from the Main Street & Anastasia greeted us when we got there and was there if we ever needed anything. The view is stunning with such a great patio. Such a great location being so close to La Grotta and some great restaurants. Would recommend staying here 1000x!
50069151,Svea May 2022 The view is mind blowing  the location perfect if you like to be everywhere quickly but also enjoy not being in the middle of the crowd 24/7! It is a very short walk to different beaches  great restaurants and also supermarkets. The apartment is perfect for 2 people  the kitchen offers everything one needs and the outdoors offer enough places for all guests to hang out and also feel private! Also the communication with the host was very easy and everyone was helpful and friendly all the time!
50069151,Tom May 2022 Palaiokastritsa itself is a perfect location for a quiet getaway. Corfu Town is only a 30 min trip by car or 1 hour by bus. The accommodation itself is perched beautifully on the coast with a fantastic view of the sea  with a very local bar only a short distance away. There are plenty of local beaches and tavernas nearby to keep every meal exciting. Anastasia and Kosta are wonderful hosts which made our stay one to remember and we will be sure to visit again.
50069151,Svenja September 2021 Once you made it up the hill you can enjoy the most amazing view of the whole area. The host is very nice and welcoming. Wouldn't wanna stay anywhere else!
50069151,Drágus August 2021 I think this was the most gorgeous view i ever saw! The terrace by it self worth a trip here!
50069151,Robert August 2021 The place was amazing! Anastasia  the host was lovely and extremely helpful and accommodating. We felt right at home. It is close enough to restaurants but far enough away to feel private and quiet. A lovely garden to relax in and just spectacular views! I would stay there again.
50069151,Audrey July 2021 The stay was perfect. Anastasia takes care of her guests like no one else. It is very well maintained  the place is ideal to come as a couple or as a family. The view is sublime  the space equipped to eat in front of the sea  have a drink  rest. The apartment is clean and functional  it smells good  it's nice. It feels like home. Truly an awesome experience! Thanks for everything really!
50069151,Nina June 2021 Perfect stay for one or couple. Amazing view to wake up to. Herb garden for relaxing. Seconds away from the best beach bar in the world.
50069151,Selina September 2022 We stayed at Villa Bouganville for 13 days. The apartment is small but functional and everything is very clean. Towels and bed linen were changed every few days. Communication on site worked great if we had any questions  a quick response was provided! The view and the garden are simply fantastic! However  it has to be said that the many steps (especially with heavy suitcase) are a hurdle. But it's always worth it for the great location! Translated from German  Show original
50069151,Cynthia August 2022 A wonderful stay at this home! The view is breathtaking  the studio is enough for a couple  simple and efficient. The welcome by Anastasia is perfect  she is a charming and very welcoming woman. Thanks again. We recommend this place 100%. Translated from French  Show original
50069151,Chiara July 2022 We enjoyed the beautiful view very much. The complex was very well maintained with an eye for detail. A nice place to get down from the hustle and bustle of Paleokastritsas. We will be happy to come back. 😊 Translated from German  Show original
50069151,Lucas August 2021 Villa Bouganville is a relaxing  attractive and very well located space. You are surrounded by very good local restaurants as well as beaches within walking distance but also by boat just below the apartment. Anastasia is very welcoming  attentive to your needs and always available in case of problems. She immediately put us at ease and gave us very good recommendations ! The accommodation is very well equipped  not to mention the large very pleasant terrace which offers stunning views of the coast opposite. The only small downside to isolation ; you could hear the neighbors a lot (especially in the morning...). Nothing to complain about except  I think  a very nice rental to stay in Corfu. Translated from French  Show original
50069151,Clémentine August 2021 No complaints about this studio as well as the host's welcome  Anastasia is very pleasant and has good advice. Breathtaking view and very functional apartment. Be careful however complicated access with a very steep slope and stairs  but the view is well worth it. Recommended ! Translated from French  Show original
50069151,Félix June 2021 Attentive hostess  incomparable view  magnificent garden calm and serenity are the key words of this breathtaking place for a most reasonable price. Recommended without  so much as a second thought Translated from French  Show original
31264807,Håkan September 2022 A simple house in a simple village with a nice pool and really good for a nice and relaxing vaccation. Its not in the discription but there is an outdoor toilet close to the pool and if ure doing like us and spend many hours by the pool its really good not to step in the house in your dripping swimmingsuit. Useless wifi around the pool area and the lights around the poolarea was turned on/off with fuses instead of a switch witch is a strange idea for itself..... Other than that the host was quick to respond our questions. If u want to go to a place for a relaxing and quiet vaccation this is the place for u....
31264807,Karly August 2022 Great place you have the whole house to yourself Quiet   no one bothers you Loved it!! Sakis was amazing with communication
31264807,Peter August 2022 What can we say… honestly we’ve never agreed to want to return to a place so quickly.(2 Adults and two Teens)  Why? Location - Yes you need a car and be a little used to Corfu local roads  but stunning. Great  early morning sunrise  4 min walk to local village round the back runs with lovely little Tavernas. Quiet and private (you may see an occasional person).  Service - perfect  Yes there were a couple of minor things however  the responsiveness from Sakis was insanely quick. Comms we’re brilliant which gave us the security we needed if ever a prob could arise when in a remote location.  Facilities- Loved the Pool area and a great little surprise (Won’t say anymore)   but fantastic. Spent most evening outside in that area of not eating out. Kitchen had all what was needed  but as said  why stay in when you have outside. Air Con  we have 39 degrees  and the air con was perfect  didn’t have to blast it  nice and quiet. Pool area had many showers and even a toilet so didn’t have to go in the house when wet  didnt see that in the description so great benefit.  Parking - Can be tricky  (local back road) but again  take time and never had an issue.  I can go on  but seriously loved it and highly recommend. 👏👏👏👏👏 Show more
31264807,K July 2022 A truly fantastic villa with an incredible view. The owner is very helpful and easy to contact and the clear instructions to find the place were spot on and easy to follow. We had a truly wonderful time. We would wholeheartedly recommend this villa
31264807,Akansha May 2022 Beautiful house in a beautiful  peaceful location. The view was stunning. Very clean and had everything you needed. The private pool was our favourite. About a 2min walk into the town through the back streets where there is a small grocery shop and a few excellent restaurants. You will need a car if wanting to leave the town  but be careful of the narrow roads. Would advise a small car. Response from Thrasyvoulos May 2022 Many thanks Akansha! I am happy to see that you got your much needed break!  Sakis Show more
31264807,Nigel September 2021 What a view! We spent a very relaxing week here enjoying the fabulous location. The private pool is a real luxury  good WiFi and you can walk into town via the back roads with ease. Parking is a little challenging but with a small car you will be fine. Very friendly local cat was an added bonus.
31264807,Richard September 2021 We had a wonderful stay in Sinarades villa. The pool and outdoor areas were amazing and the view from the balcony was fantastic. We had a few barbeques in the outdoor areas by the pool and watched many sunsets from the balcony. The villa is within walking distance from the town and a fantastic lookout where you can see the ocean. A great retreat in the countryside! Check-in process was fantastic and Thrasyvoulos was very responsive and helpful - he gave very detailed instructions on how to reach the property.
31264807,Albertien August 2021 This old renewed house looks over the village and hills on the east side of the island  beautiful views and nice cooling breeze on the balcony! A short walk through the narrow streets leads to the village. The clear cooled pool is great! The house has good airco. Centrally located for beaches and town We did not meet Sakis but the communication was fine and immediate and easy.
31264807,Arnaud July 2021 We stayed 3 nights in Sakis House. It was a very pleasant stay. The house is fully equipped and very confortable and the pool is a must as we experienced a tough heat wave during our stay. Sinarades village is very nice as well. We recommend Sakis House.
31264807,Jason June 2021 Lovely villa in a peaceful spot at the top of the village. The view is simply incredible - we really enjoyed sitting on the terrace and watching the birds fly around us before a backdrop of beautiful hills and the mountains of Albania.  The pool was really welcome in the heat  and we enjoyed our stay immensely.
31264807,Alice October 2020 Myself and my partner had a great stay at Saki’s  very relaxing with amazing views from the veranda situated in a lovely little village in a picturesque olive grove. The host was very helpful with lots of great local recommendations and was very quick at responding to any questions we had. Thank you!
31264807,Kriss October 2020 Stayed in Sakis Villa this last week. A great place to escape and relax. Excellent communication throughout and nice easy to follow instructions for around the villa. Thank you Sakis.
31264807,Debra September 2020 WOW! The view from the veranda is spectacular! The location of the house was perfect for us as it was so peaceful. The village is lovely  just a short walk down the hill. The restaurant we ate at mostly was in the main square. So friendly and accommodating. One week was just not enough. Sakis made our stay very easy. He communicated as soon as I sent a message. All the information provided was very clear and very helpful. We will definitely stay again but for much longer this time. Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful home.
31264807,Andreas September 2020 Sakis house is great! Big enough for 4 ppl  a nice view from the balcony and a great garden with pool and outdoor kitchen. He also helped us with great recommendations and answered all our questions quickly
31264807,Mfj August 2020 This place is truly amazing!  Sakis is a wonderful host. Communicating with him is very easy  he responds very quickly and he is always helpful.  The house is great and beautiful located on a hill where you have an amazing view over Corfu. It’s quiet and centrally located on the island which makes it a perfect place to get around the island. We would recommend to get there by car. Corfu is far better to explore by car anyway. The road to get to the house is a bit bumpy and narrow so take your time to get there. But it’s perfectly doable.  The place is perfectly clean. Has two bathrooms and two bedrooms located below which makes that they are kept cool. If you still think it’s too hot  there’s an airconditioning available in every room. And also pretty important the beds are nice too.  The swimming pool which comes with the house is private and ever couple of days Sakis will check the water to make sure the water quality is good.  Thank you so much Sakis for making our holiday to Corfu unforgettable! We will definitely come back and we hope we can stay again at your house!  All the best   Mark Sandra  Mick and Morris Show more
31264807,Lorraine September 2019 The perfect weekend getaway pad in the sunshine! The views across the mountains are spectacular from the veranda. And the outside pool has a water jet so you can swim for miles against it. A short drive from Corfu main town makes it ideally located. Best of all  the communication from the host is second to none which makes your stay glitch free.
31264807,Peter September 2019 This is a beautiful villa in a calm  peaceful place 5min walk from a pretty Corfiot village with friendly locals  a couple of good tavernas and 2 mini markets for supplies. The views are beautiful and facilities include an ‘opposite’ pool for exercise  large balconies with lovely views and outside there is a bbq and covered seating area. This is a gem for people who just want to relax and enjoy peace and calm away from the pace of a busy resorts. Although it is in a small village  it’s close to Corfu town (14km)  and the beautiful west coast with its beaches is just 10km away. Sakis is a perfect host and by the time we arrived we already had full and clear instructions about the house and pool. Sakis was always available for any questions we had and was quick to respond. Little touches like water in the fridge  shower gel in the bathrooms and soft clean towels added to the welcome. Air conditioning was in and ready in all rooms. We hired a car for the week  but only used it a couple of times because we were so happy and content where we were. Thanks for a wonderful break.
31264807,Niculina September 2019 Staying on Sakis house was a beautiful experience. The house is most awesome than is in the pictures. It has all the modern amenities  air conditioning  washing machine  dishing machine  it was perfectly clean and to make everything more than perfect  the swimming pool with that awesome swimming kit and the barbecue terras with fridge near it was the supreme. Sakis was the perfect host and although he was not nearby  he answered us almost instantly to all our questions and requests. What impressed us the most   was that at the half of our holiday he wrote to ask us if everything was all right or if we were not lack of something or if we want to help us in any problem. Thank you Sakis for a perfect holiday in your beautiful house. We will definitely return.
31264807,G August 2019 We had a fabulous time at Villa Sinarades. A family of two adults and three children (13  11 and 10) the house and pool (kids wouldn’t get out  pool side BBQ  area was a hit with them also including fridge which we stocked with local produce) were just great. Local village was quaint and so picturesque  pure original Corfu  both house and village had everything we needed and just what we wanted. Sakis was super quick to respond to everything from check in to letting us know how to use appliances etc in the house  so friendly we were impressed for sure. Sakis thank you  We will be sure to be back.
31264807,Frank August 2019 This is a fabulous place to stay with great amenities - especially the pool - very relaxing - It is everything you need for a holiday  very private and peaceful - the village is 5 minutes walk away and everyone very welcoming - definitely recommend this villa.
31264807,Linda August 2019 We absolutely loved Thrasyvoulos's stone house. The views from the balcony are stunning and the pool area is very clean and having the pool was certainly a bonus. Although it is set high up it is within easy reach of several beautiful beaches and with a 2 year old grandson were very safe and sandy. There is also a very good taverna in the village and mini markets for supplies. My family and I would like to thank Thrasyvoulos for letting us stay in his family home and would certainly recommend it to others.
31264807,Gerald August 2019 This house has all you need for wonderful holidays. We spent two weeks at Sakis' house and really enjoyed it. We found the house very clean and tidy. From the loggia you have a wonderful view over the hills of Corfu. You can spend hours there watching the airplanes starting and landing at the horizon or just enjoy the beautiful landscape. The house is located on the outskirts of Sinarades up the hill and a quite place. What makes it unique is the great swimming pool with the hydrojet for endless swimming. Nearby there is a BBQ area with outdoor kitchen sheltered from the sun. In the house the sitting room and the two bedrooms have separate air condition units so that you always feel comfortable. Last but not least Sakis was a very committed host during our stay  fast responding and helpful. Having a small car is advantagerous all over Corfu and at the house as parking space is limited and even turning the car is tricky.
31264807,Clive July 2019 What a gem  I shouldn’t really being saying this as everyone will want to visit and it will be booked up when we want to go back next year. We had six nights thinking that would be enough tucked away in a small village in a charming villa  we were wrong  we would have happily spent much longer there. The villa is tucked away at the top edge of Sinarades village and offers seclusion  but not isolation with views from the veranda that make you just sit down and chill and the pool and BBQ area are not only a welcome relief from the heat  but a superb addition to what is a superb find. The village offers mini markets  a butchers  pharmacy and a cafes/bars  however  we would highly recommend supper at Archontariki Taverna  a family run business where we spent 5 out of our 6 evenings having supper and sampling genuine Corfiot cuisine. It is a short  but steepish walk as you wind your way down the alley next to the villa passing through narrow streets to reach the central village road where you will find all the amenities. When people say book a small car take them by their word  roads are a little tight  especially in the hills or as you approach the coastal villages on the West of the Island.  Sakis  the owner and host provides everything that you will need for an extremely comfortable stay in his family owned villa and although he was away in Norway during our stay he kept in touch and kindly phoned me to explain something rather than communicate the response by e-mail  which I thought was exceptionally thoughtful  a superb host - thank you.

31264807,Darren July 2019 We spent two wonderful weeks in Sakis’ house. The views will blow you away from the first moment you step into it - the upstairs and downstairs terraces are great places to eat and look at the world. The amenities are great  with all cooking appliances you might need and more. The air conditioning in each room works so well you don’t need it on for long (and we were there in a heat wave!). I recommend you hire a small car for getting to the villa  as the beautiful olive grove lane is narrow and the parking spaces are easier for small cars. The best and most unique thing for us in the house was the private outside space with the pool and cooking area. There are no neighbours overlooking the house  so it is so peaceful to spend time there - and the swimming machine in the pool means you can get some easy exercise before walking down the few steps into the village  where there are three small shops and a couple of tavernas - but the short walk into the village is a walk through Greek social history. Response from Thrasyvoulos July 2019 Thank you very much for your good words and your stay Darren! It was a real pleasure hosting you guys and would love to see you again next year!
31264807,Benjamin June 2019 Location: The house is very close to a beautiful village. Photographers  you’ll enjoy the beautiful little streets. Gourmets  the local food is delicious  don’t worry about that.  The house: very clean  the view is incredible. Sun is shinning on the pool all day and the pool house is very comfy and helps for fresh air. Fully equipped  all intentions were here when i arrived : soaps  sponges  towels  salt  paper  olive oil  dishwashing liquid  etc.  Communication: Sakis is very nice and reactive. All instructions were really clear. He will help you to get good addresses  for sure!  What else could I say? It was the best holidays I have ever had :) Response from Thrasyvoulos June 2019 Many many thanks Benjamin! Wish you all the best and hope to see you again! Maybe next time at your home city in Paris!
31264807,Modestas June 2019 All our stay was amazing. The location is very very nice. The house is located right on the top oh the village. So basically you feel like there is only you. Nobody’s windows faces the Villa so its quite private property. All is modern inside and sparkling clean. The swimming pool is really cool. You can have endless swimming i there. Lots of space. We were 2 adults and 2 kids but you can easily add another 2 adults in there and you won’t feel squashed at all. Scenery in the terrace is amazing as all the Corfu is like in your hand. Lovely beaches within 20 min drive. There is a local shop in town just 5 mins from the Vila walking down the little street that does local vine. Will recommend to all age groups/family’s for a relaxing holiday. As you can be out all day and relax by the pool in the evening having a BBQ and a drink. Will try to go back in the future. Host reply instantly if you have any questions and even gives you a tip where to dine and what to see. So far the best BNB villa that I have seen. Response from Thrasyvoulos June 2019 Many many thanks Modestas!  It is very rewarding to have such reviews. I will be glad to host your family again anytime! All the best. Show more
31264807,Jenna May 2019 A fantastic villa  it could easily fit 5 people but was nice and spacious for just me and my partner. We hired a car and travelled around Corfu  so I would recommend hiring a car too or there is also a bus stop close by. The villa itself was perfectly clean and had everything that we needed during our stay. The owner also provides a great service  thanks again!! Response from Thrasyvoulos June 2019 Thank you very much Jenna!  All the best to you. I will be happy to host you guys again in the future! Show more
31264807,Pawel May 2019 The Villa is beautiful. The area is great  remote and very calm and quite. The details how to get here are perfect and we did not have any problem reaching it by car. I think car is needed in this location as the village is in the mountain and the villa is at the edge of it higher. That results in marvelous views as you can see the sea; mountains and in the evening glowing cross from the Corfu Fortress. Great stuff. The house is a bit dark as the windows are small and you have to use the lights even during the day but i assume its a benefit during the very hot summer. The pool was great with this endless swimming option. Bigger pool was not possible here and the system does the job. There is a gas grill provided as well which is very good for leisure in front of the pool for the whole day. Outside there is a place to eat with sink  water and fridge. The electronic locks system is working very well. The host is perfect  answering very quickly and providing good information about all you ask. The area of Sinarades is great - very nice people who are becoming friends after a minute; good tavernas nearby with friendly owners. If you plan to take a car for the trip - consider a small car are the whole Sinarades has very narrow streets and the Villa parking area is small. We had Nissan Micra during the stay and it was ok. But if we had foe example normal 4 door sedan it would be a problem. Last thing you have to remember here is to always turn on the water heating around 20 minutes before you want to take a bath to heat it. Generally I recommend this place to everybody who wants to have a peaceful place only for you. If you want to party outside - not the place. If you want to rest and have a perfects place to see the island - it is perfect as long as you have a car. Enjoy as we did. Show more
31264807,Nicole August 2022 The stay was perfect for us. The location of the villa is simply brilliant. The view is breathtaking. Due to the detailed driving directions from Sakis  we found the house immediately. The description was consistent with local reality. The village is a 5-minute walk and has everything you need. 2 minutes by car there is a viewpoint where you can look out on the west side of the island. You can walk there via a small trail to the sea (it took us 30 minutes/back 20 minutes). The outdoor kitchen with fridge with freezer   sink and gas grill was absolutely great. In the pool area there were 2 showers and another toilet.  In the evening the pool area and the villa were very nicely illuminated.  We would also like to praise the communication with Sakis. We can only confirm the statements of the previous guests. Inquiries were answered at very short notice.  We had a wonderful time at the villa and will be happy to come back!!!  Dear Sakis - thank you for everything!! Show more Translated from German  Show original
31264807,Heiner October 2021 We enjoyed the stay  it is as the previous visitors have already written a wonderful location to relax and enjoy the tranquility. The contact was straightforward  even if the landlord lives in Norway. We were allowed to check out later on the last day.  But we also have a few points that we didn't like. Unfortunately  we were not able to use the pool because the heating didn't work. The dishwasher was also broken. The water in Corfu is limestone  but the water runs were partly not to be used and had to be decalcified by us first. The cleanliness  however  made us most annoyed  even in the fridge we found black long hair. There was an old filter in the coffee maker. Therefore  here are the clear deductions in our review.

31264807,Victoria June 2021 We had a great holiday week in Sinarades for a girls holiday for four. From the beginning  we got a lot of valuable information and tips from the host. He was always available. With the directions received in advance  we found the house great. However  the roads on Corfu are very narrow and the access road is also rather small  so do not choose a rental car too large. The house was clean  the equipment worked well including washing machine and dishwasher. The balcony where you can enjoy the vacation until late in the evening is outstanding. Great plus is the pool. It's great for cooling off. A functional grill is also available. The place itself is little touristy with lots of little streets and taverns. We enjoyed that very much. The location is also well suited for exploring all parts of the island. Thanks for the great holiday week! Translated from German  Show original
31264807,Alexa August 2020 The house is wonderful. The view is indescribable and the pool in particular ensures a great cooling off in between. Through the balcony as well as the outdoor area around the pool  you can spend the whole day comfortably outside without leaving the house. Sinarades is a small village that is not touristy. We felt very welcome there and warmly welcomed. The location of the house is also very well located for excursions. Because it is located in the middle of the island  you can explore the whole island by car without having to take a very long drive. However  our recommendation is to forgo a large car  as the roads in the surrounding places are often very narrow. Sakis is a friendly host. He responded very directly and thoroughly to all questions and also inquired about our well-being during our stay. Especially in the current Corona period  a vacation there is highly recommended  as you are not forced to have contact with many people through the house. All in all  I wish every guest there a nice time and can fully recommend the house. Translated from German  Show original
31264807,Jerome August 2020 A nice house  in a great village  Sakis has been lovely since the start of the reservation and we recommend a very good tavern in the village. We highly recommend this rental. Translated from French  Show original
31264807,Oliver July 2020 Despite Covid 19 we spent 2 wonderful weeks here. Sinarades is very suitable as a starting point for excursions or beach days  a rental car is absolutely necessary. But the pool and balcony with the magnificent views also invite you to linger. It was outstanding how Sakis took care of everything remotely! We will definitely recommend the place.

31264807,Magdalena April 2019 A Greek house with a great view. Sunrises visible from above the Albani Mountains. Fully equipped  good for two.  Connect with your landlord immediately. Thank you so much for the time we may have spent in your home and your kindness.  A small house in the Corfu where you can find beautiful original architecture. The old town of Sinarades connects with 'non-Greek' technical mind and equipment. It's a huge perk. ;)  And a swimming pool with heated water which is wonderful in April when the water is still cold in the sea. Translated from Polish  Show original
10691883,Rebecca October 2022 What an amazing place! Location is just paradise  the beach house is well equipped clean and comfortable. Hosts are really responsive and helpful with any questions. What you can’t see in the photographs is the privacy you get from staying here even when there was a family in the beach house next door for a couple of days we really felt like we were the only ones on the island and the beach was all ours. Never said this about a specific accommodation but I’ll definitely return as the best part about our whole trip was going back to our little paradise.
10691883,Katrine October 2022 This is like a dream it’s so perfect here . Don’t be put off by the price. It is worth every penny. If you are someone looking to really get away and are not a resort kind of a person- this is the place for you. It has everything you need and more.
10691883,Leah October 2022 Absolutely beautiful stay! Communication with Spyridoula and panagiota was great  and the house comfortably slept 4 (the sofa beds were very comfy and sizeable). The location is unbeatable - and the property comes with kayaks and goggles which we loved. Keep in mind the property is atleast a 40 minute drive from the main town - a beautiful drive but may be more difficult at night if you are unfamiliar with the roads. Quiet  peaceful and lovely. We will come back!
10691883,Jason October 2022 Loved it thanks
10691883,Emma October 2022 Loved the ease of check in  the friendly nature of your messages  the property itself and the sea at the bottom of the garden.  The addition of the bottle of the wine and fridge magnet was a lovely touch.  The property is well equipped with towels  games and books.
10691883,Matthew October 2022 Home Maro is such a beautiful place! You have a peaceful garden and a nice little beach with calm  shallow water. It was a perfect spot for our kids to play in the water. There’s a great taverna nearby that sits on the water. Spyridoula and Panagiota were wonderful hosts. They are really responsive and always available if you have questions. And they had some great recommendations for places to eat or visit. Overall  we really enjoyed our stay.
10691883,Char September 2022 This is an incredible location with beautiful views  thoughtful and comfortable amenities  and excellent swimming in a shallow beach far out. A great place to relax fully.
10691883,Sara September 2022 Fantastic location. Cute house with a lot of great little details. We loved it.
10691883,Lisa September 2022 What an amazing trip we had. Loved the outdoor shower. Learned to kayak and just swimming in the water. Was so relaxed and we enjoyed our time so much. Walking in the water along the beach to the tavern for lunch was so nice. Spyridoula and Panagiota were great host always attentive to any questions. We forgot our bathing suits hs going on the tree and they nailed to us. Highly recommend this slice of heaven if you want peace and quite.
10691883,Rachel September 2022 We had a lovely stay at Home Maro. The house is lovely and the garden so shady and relaxing with lovely plants and trees. The house was very clean and comfortable. The location is perfect as the sea is literally right outside the garden gate! Spyridoula and Panagiota were so helpful  particularly when I had a medical situation that needed urgent attention. In general  they were very patient with all my questions! We had a wonderful and peaceful stay at their property. Highly recommended!
10691883,Sarah September 2022 Such a beautiful and peaceful spot. Perfect for kids. We had a fantastic stay. Thanks so much
10691883,Pippa August 2022 It was a fantastic stay  the house very well equipped and needs catered for. Lots of really thoughtful touches and helpful extras. So nice having the kayaks they were such a joy and we felt made a huge difference to our enjoyment and adventures. Thank you so much.
10691883,Geoff August 2022 Perfect location right on the beach  kayaking was enjoyed by all our family. Absolutely fabulous for families with small Children as the sea is shallow until about 500 metres out. Taverna by the sea nearby  Taverna in the one way system is fabulous. Bakery next door and small supermarket all within 5 minutes drive. Parking at the rear of the villa is available  totally perfect holiday.
10691883,Steven August 2022 We booked the house last-minute for a single night between landing in Corfu and taking a ferry to Paxos the following day. We were only really looking for a bed for the night  but this place had such a wonderful atmosphere we left wishing we could have stayed here for the rest of the week! The sea lapping literally at the garden gate  the lovely garden with fire and barbecue  the taverna located a short wade through the sea away.. Spyridoula and Panagiota have done a lovely job of renovating their family beach house into something that offers modern facilities without losing the original modest charm of the place  and on top of this their tasteful yet quirky decor and provision of plenty of fluffy towels etc makes for a very welcoming experience. We’d love to visit again!
10691883,Ella August 2022 What an amazing place to stay!! Beautiful beach and sunsets  clean  well equipped and well decorated house. Hosts Spyridoula and Panagiota went above and beyond to help us. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a relaxing stay right on the beach!
10691883,David July 2022 Home Maro is an idyllic beach cottage literally with the ocean on your doorstep!! The house is well appointed and has all the necessities needed to enjoy your stay. We fitted in comfortably as a family of 5. It also has air-conditioning - which can provide some needed respite from the summer heat.  The beach in front of the house is soft and sandy and being only two meters from the garden gate means you can go for a dip in the ocean and back to reading a book in the scenic garden as often as you like throughout the day.  The host truly is a super-host and assisted us in every way possible to make our stay memorable and enjoyable and went above and beyond.  If you are looking for a private and quiet escape to Corfu  with the ocean on your doorstep - then I would highly recommend Home Maro.  It is also ideal for families with younger children as the beach and the sea are safe for them to explore and you can keep an eye on them from the comfort of your own garden!! We will definitely visit again.  We loved our stay and a memorable trip to Corfu.  Thank you Spyridoula and Panagiota. Show more
10691883,Emma July 2022 Amazing place to stay
10691883,Barbara July 2022 Absolutely idyllic. Our family of 4 had a wonderful few days in Home Maro-clean  comfortable with everything you need. The water is so warm that we often swam late evening and enjoyed the stunnjng sunset. We had planned to eat in the local taverna (and enjoyed wading to it ) but didn’t enjoy the food much so just went to the supermarket and ate in the garden instead. Best AirBnB ever!
10691883,Ana June 2022 The cottage is just as described. The beach is a stones throw away. Must have car to get to supermarket. Sea is lovely and warm. Beds very comfortable. Beautiful location!
10691883,Elizabeth May 2022 Had a wonderful stay  the garden is a small slice of paradise. Would highly recommend kayaking over to the pier and getting a drink at the beach bar.
10691883,Stratis May 2022 What a place! exactly as advertised and perfect if you are looking to mindfully relax. Service was perfect. Can't find anything wrong with the hosts or the property
10691883,Catherina Adriana May 2022 The proximity to the beach is what makes this place so very special. We also felt very safe and even decided to sleep under the stars one night. That is when we discovered there are also fireflies around. So special.It would always be a favorite family memory. Not a huge fan of Lefkimi itself though.
10691883,Jas May 2022 A beautiful home in an idyllic setting. With the sea lapping gently at the end of the garden  many good tavernas close by and a house that met all our needs  Home Maro proved a perfect break away. It is fulfils all its promises.
10691883,Lizzy May 2022 We absolutely loved this little piece of paradise by the sea. It’s very well equipped and the location is amazing!! Everything was very clean and the decoration is beautiful and cosy! We would definitely come here again!!
10691883,Caitlin April 2022 Spyridoula & Panagiota’s beach house was so nice!!! Having our own private beach and that idyllic back garden was AMAZING. The perfect spot for a quiet retreat. The local grocery store was about a ten minute drive  and the perfect place to buy all you need to use the outdoor bbq. Our host was amazing  and communication was great!! She was available to help with anything we needed and was so accommodating to our needs. Would 100% recommend for a relaxing vacation!!
10691883,Nick April 2022 After finding Villa Maro and booking it  we were rather excited as the pictures make it look so idyllic. We arrived on a sunny April day and were bowled over with the place. It’s utterly charming  is quirky and beautifully considered  and the location is just heavenly. Our week there is one we shall remember and would dearly love to return one day soon. The facilities are spot on  the outside area is wonderful and the doorstep beach is perfect for younger kids. We could sit and watch our 7 and 9yo boys kayaking around  knowing the water was little more than thigh high. We explored Corfu a bit  but to be honest  coming  “home”  was always the best bit  and we treated ourselves on our final day by not leaving Maro. A very special day. Thank you so much Spyridoula and Panagiota. The best hosts out there❤️
10691883,Anthony April 2022 if looking for a great base to explore the island   or a place to chill and relax….. then this is your place .. everything we needed for 2 adults 2 kids   seawater was shallow so kids could play in water safely  and kayaks were a great way to get out and enjoy the scenery…. we will definitely stay again when we visit …. you do need a car   which was good as got us out exploring the island … thanks for a lovely stay 👌
10691883,Nawal February 2022 It was a perfect stay. The place is truly enchanting for those who wants to be in quiet and peaceful world. Absolutely recommended.
10691883,Marianne February 2022 We loved staying at Maro Dream House. It is a beautiful location with everything we needed including Kayaks and an outdoor fireplace and perfect views. Spryridoula was so quick to answer any queries and very friendly and helpful.
10691883,Dafinka January 2022 It was very clean. More than expected.
10691883,Anna November 2021 The most gorgeous little house in a fabulous setting. My friend and I loved our 4 day stay here (beginning of November)  and were grateful for the winter sun! Communication is fantastic - Spyridoula was very kind in giving us lots of recommendations. A car is essential  the location is quite remote. Everything very much closed down for the season but we just enjoyed the beach/sea/cooking in the house. Amazing shower! We didn't get to use the outdoor BBQ but there is a taverna 5 minutes away with a fab decking overlooking the sea and great seafood. Would be nice to return when more is open
10691883,Jacqueline October 2021 The location of Home Maro is really nice. If you need a quiet place to come down this is the perfect place. We enjoyed the 'private' beach and the garden and loved to wake up to the sound of the (small) waves. Inside the house you will find everything you need although investment in the maintenance is recommended.
10691883,Sara October 2021 Wonderful  quiet place for a family getaway. Perfect location for small children to have the beach in your front yard  calm water  very shallow and wonderful for kids to play safely.
10691883,Lorien September 2021 Wow home maro is paradise! Enjoying the sunsets in the garden  having fun in the sea  the most beautiful starry nights  sleep-ins with the sound of the waves  it was just perfect! We have the most beautiful and fun memories of home maro and Spyridoula & Panagiota are great hosts! Highly recommend :)
10691883,Libby September 2021 A lovely spot right on the beach which was perfect for my daughter. The house itself is well equipped with everything you’d need and very clean. The nearby restaurant was good. We didn’t get a chance to explore the area (passing through to Paxos - good for the ferry from the nearby port) but where we did was beautiful and will be back for a longer trip.
10691883,Konstantin September 2021 A unique quite place in Corfu. We also enjoyed several amazing beaches in 10-30 minutes driving distance and fantastic food in Lefkimi and other neighboring places. Good for families with small kids because of shallow waters in front of the house. However  be prepared for mosquitoes and wasps  which are quite often met on the island in general. The house has everything you might need and even a welcome bottle of wine and fruits. The owners are very nice and kindly allowed us to check out considerably later. Highly recommend.
10691883,Веселка September 2021 The view was breathtaking.
10691883,Matteo September 2021 This is a difficult review. A great host  with impressive response time  a lot of thoughtful touches all around the cottage  really a beach only for you. One could say - as many others have done! - what else can you wish for? Well  I had mixed feelings that I expressed to Spyridoula during our stay. A guest really needs to study the island and get familiar with the Lefkimmi area before choosing this remote little gem. The cottage is in good conditions  equipped with everything you need  but in my humble opinion you need to have in mind that you want to self-isolate here. You need to have that specific holiday in mind. Rest  stay there  enjoy the sea in front of you  do some grocery. Lefkimmi is unfortunately a little town that has been ignored by tourism and local commerce/activities  so it is frankly an unimpressive spot on the island  with all possible respect for truly amazing people living there. The house surroundings give the same feeling of being slightly abandoned by locals. The Corfu town is 1 hour away in normal driving conditions  Paleokastritza 1.5h. In terms of cost  the cottage is on average more expensive that most of comparable accommodations but you pay the seclusion and beach facility
10691883,Denisa August 2021 Great place to recharge your batteries!!! Having the sea in your backyard it’s an amazing experience!Spyridoula was very helpful in giving us lots of tips for the surroundings. Location of the house is a little bit far from Corfu town ( 1h drive)and northern part of the island where majority of nice beaches are  but if you have a car should not be a problem to check them. Overall we had a wonderful experience staying in House Maro that I recommend 😊
10691883,Charlotte August 2021 Home Maro is magical - quiet location with beautiful  calm sea. The house is very comfortable and the pretty garden has plenty of shade. We would love to return !
10691883,Jenni August 2021 What a place! The beach house is beautifully decorated  comfortable  clean  had everything we needed and the view is amazing. It was so special and unique for us to have the beach at the end of the garden  and the water is perfect for young children  incredibly shallow and warm. We used the canoes to paddle along to the taverna (5 mins away) which was a fun adventure for our little people! Really lovely  kind and helpful hosts too. We didn’t find the plumbing dodgy (as someone has said before) so perhaps that’s now fixed. All was perfect for us. We will come back!
10691883,Paul July 2021 The house of Spyridoula and Panagiota with the wonderful garden full of flowers is like a small paradise  very quiet and away from the business of the beaches and towns further up of the Island of Corfu. To be able to get up early morning and to have a swim in the sea which is just a few meters away is really great. Also nice to use the canoes and enjoy the clear water further down in the bay. We stayed for three days only  but these three days will stay with us for a long time. Thanks S&P for creating this great place.
10691883,Yae July 2021 The beach locates in front of the house and the water level was really low all the time  so my kids  5 and 7 were able to snorkel and kayak by themselves from the morning till the evening. The water was also warm…..what a heaven for children. When we were hungry  just walked 2 minutes on the beach to the traditional tavern for fresh fish dish and salad. The host welcomed us with Greek wine and everything we needed. The house decor was really beautiful too. Best place ever we stayed.
10691883,Laurie June 2021 Peaceful location right on the water. Toaster caused a power cut and water a bit dodgy  but these are minor quibbles. Overall fantastic!
10691883,Marc-Marie June 2021 We loved the house and the location was perfect. Spyridoula did everything in her power to create a great vacation for us. The house on the beach is very special  you will love it. Communication was always easy and quick. We highly recommend it.
10691883,Noah June 2021 Amazing quiet beach getaway in Corfu!! Home Maro is situated on a very shallow sandy beach that is away from crowds where you can enjoy some peace and quiet. There is one Taverna down the beach that has decent food and drink  otherwise Lefkimmi is 10-15 minutes away. Check in was easy and Spyridoula was very flexible and accommodating. The house was relatively clean  and most of the essentials were there for us. The outdoor space was very beautiful and inside was decorated well  but seemed less clean compared to other Airbnbs we have stayed at in Corfu. The beds were a little hard  but comfortable enough for a good sleep. This area of Corfu has a lot of beautiful sandy beaches to explore! Would recommend Home Maro for anyone who is looking for a private beach getaway!!
10691883,Bart May 2021 Very welcoming hosts and a lovely quaint place where the views are the star. Nice outdoor seating area and a short drive to necessary shops and nearby pristine beaches.
10691883,Leigh May 2021 Spyridoula is possibly the most responsive  generous  and flexible airbnb host I've ever stayed with. (and I've stayed in a lot of airbnbs). She was an absolute delight. Her family cottage on the beach in quiet Lefkimmi is the perfect getaway. The town is definitely off the beaten path but less than an hour drive from busy - and touristy- Corfu town. the yard with a gate to the ocean is perfect for kids or pets. Highly recommend!
10691883,Sam November 2020 Wow.  We decided to stay an extra week in Corfu and changed from one Airbnb to Home Maro. And we are SO glad we did.  Beautiful place with our own beach  used the kayaks every morning and even paddled over to the local fisherman to get some just caught fish for the BBQ.  Incredible sunsets  lovely hosts  a massive BBQ and a lovely veranda to work under...fantastic WiFi a big plus for us working abroad.  Wine  fruit & pasta a lovely arrival gift and welcomed a Nespresso in the morning.  Can’t wait to come back!  Thanks! Sam & Frankie Show more
10691883,Gemma November 2020 What a simple but beautiful little beach house on the quiet south coast. Great host and nothing was too much trouble. The kayaks are a great idea to get out on the water. So calm. Perfect winter sun too in Oct/Nov.
10691883,Paul October 2020 This is all about the location right on the sea. Spent the whole time in the garden even in October.
10691883,Craig October 2020 This is a great place for a short stay - 3-5 days. The house itself is right on the beach and the view of the sea and mountains from the end of the garden is inspiring. The house is a chalet really  quite small  good for up to 4  any more is a squeeze. Facilities are of a good standard. The hosts are excellent and responsive. We needed a few things - extra blankets   towels and so on and they were there the next day. We had a couple of breakages (kids) and again the hosts were relaxed. The town nearby is unremarkable so you will need a car to go anywhere good. We liked Palaiokastritsa a great deal and would go again. Neighbouring resorts of Kavos and Messongi appeal to the young  British end of the market. But what you are getting at Maro is the seclusion  the sea  the swimming and the awe inspiring view. This is what Maro is all about. Peace and quiet. Relaxation.
10691883,Nichola October 2020 Just home from a wonderful 4 day holiday staying in this beautiful retreat of a house. We arrived to warm October sunshine to a little paradise. The house looks exactly like the photos  is clean and has everything you need. Kitchen well stocked  bathroom quirky with power shower and bedrooms airy and bright. Garden is cute and stylish. We made a fire in the BBQ on our only rainy day  we sat in front of it listening to music  reading and chatting. That was a real treat. The beach is very small but big enough to place a couple of chairs on the sand and watch the sunset. Every night we were lucky enough to enjoy this. Views out to sea are amazing. We used the paddle board and kayaks  we ventured across the bay to Taverna Aristos in the kayaks which was great fun... 7km kayak round trip. An hour there  ice cream stop and an hour back. The taverna looked like it was serving lovely food and you can sit right on the beach to eat. There is another restaurant at the other end of the beach which we loved. Friendly people and food was delicious. We enjoyed Greek salad  beautiful fresh fish  Greek vegetables with some Prosecco!! We actually visited this restaurant every day of our trip as it was easy to walk to  5 mins from the house. You have to walk a little bit in the sea to get there as the beach is very narrow but this was fun! We hired a car... 1 hour drive from the Airport. The area is quite deserted  nothing much to do other than enjoy the peace and the sea. This is a very laid back holiday destination. The house and neighbouring house are the best houses on this stretch of coastline. Other houses are derelict and in need of repair. It feels like the area needs some money spent on it. Thanks for having us!!! Show more
10691883,Jana October 2020 We had a very nice time in the house by the beach. The view and the shower in the garden are real highlights. Thank you for the warm welcome and the tips you gave us.
10691883,Belinda September 2020 I have just returned from a weeks stay at Home Maro. End of the season so incredibly quiet. Very peaceful. I went alone & pretty much had the sea to myself  but even as a lone female  I felt very safe. Great kitchen facilities  so prepared meals at the beach house  although there’s a local taverna down the beach if preferred. I just read & slept  & recharged my batteries. All queries I had were responded to within minutes. Nothing was too much trouble. Extremely clean with all the amenities you need. You do need a car  which again was organised for me. Highly recommended
10691883,Lauren-May September 2020 Beautiful  feels like such a safe place to be in during the current climate of Covid 19 with a practically private beach at the door step. Thank you both!😊
10691883,Chrissy September 2020 This is the holiday house of dreams. The only reason we stayed in Lefkimmi was because we wanted to stay in this house  and I’m so glad we did. I could go on and on about how great it is  but just book it and see for yourself. The location is amazing  so peaceful. To open the front door and be on the beach is quite special. The beach is lovely and quiet  the sea clear and warm. The lovely family run taverna just along the beach is lovely and so friendly  food great and reasonably priced. Spyridoula is the most amazing thoughtful host. From helping us resolve a flat tyre issue  to answering my constant questions  offering great tips on where to eat  nothing was ever too much trouble. I’m going to miss falling asleep to the sound of the sea. A truly blissful holiday.
10691883,Mark August 2020 An idyllic place to relax and unwind. The property is as described and is perfect get awy from the tourist trek. Loved it!!!
10691883,Chris August 2020 We had a nice stay at the house. The location right at the beach is stunning. The tavern 50 meters away serves local food and excellent quality and value. We where not aware that the house is the right part of a vacation rental. The other left part was rented too. For us meaning a lively week with neighbour children playing from morning till evening ( which they should by all means!! Its heaven for children!!! And it great to see kids having so much fun) instead of a quiet retreat. During the day we went to a lovely beach 10 minutes by car. Once again  it is a nice place but  based on the add  we were not aware that it is not a free standing house.
10691883,Catherine July 2020 We had a lovely few days at Home Maro. The house is right on the beach and the water is perfect for swimming. The hosts were extremely responsive and friendly. We hope to be back soon.
10691883,Lisa July 2020 This house is great for a relaxing and beautiful vacation. The sunsets are Wonderful! It’s perfect for a small family too because the water right in front of the house is a comfortable temperature and it’s shallow for a while before it gets deep so little kids can play safely. The house had everything we needed. The tavern down the beach was open all day and super friendly and casual.
10691883,Blake July 2020 An absolutely amazing place with a phenomenal view and location!!! Highly recommend Maro - so peaceful and serene!
10691883,Sam October 2019 What a special stay we had in this lovely Home on the beach. Very well equipped  clean and totally charming. Excellent communications with our hosts who also left a generous welcome package and arranged a taxi for us. I would recommend Home Maro without hesitation for a peaceful beachside home from home xxx
10691883,Mark October 2019 Lovely little villa on the sea shore. Has lots of personal touches .
10691883,John September 2019 Lovely house  with stylish and thoughtful touches. High quality bathroom with very good shower. Inside is charming and comfortable but outside is really great. A shady table  deck chairs and a nice tree lined garden which gives straight onto the beach where there are a couple of loungers. The sea here is quite shallow for a good way out so ideal for children but also good for adults looking for a quick splash to cool down. You hardly need to leave here but if you do there is a really nice taverna a few yards down the beach. You will need your own transport for shopping tho. The hosts were also super helpful and friendly. They had provided lots of useful food stuff (eg fruit  coffee  veg  water  wine etc) plus soap  shampoo and sun tan lotion. And were really quick to reply to any questions we had. 100% recommended.
10691883,Niki August 2019 What an amazing quiet  beautiful and awesome place. We are a family of 4 and enjoyed a 10 day stay here in August. The house is  as seen on the photos  with the amazing garden that is right on the beach. How wonderful to be able to get up and straight into a warm beautiful clear sea every morning  and to sit and watch the sunset over the hills of Corfu every night. The outside shower is a real plus and was well used over our stay. There is a friendlyTaverna 2 minutes walk along the beach. Bring snorkels to enjoy the fish around the wooden boardwalk. This is a really quiet area and a perfect spot to relax and unwind.
10691883,Adele August 2019 This home is a real gem. The cottage is beautiful with everything you need. We are a family of four and it was plenty big enough for us. The beds are very comfortable  lovely little bathroom with big shower. There’s a utility room with washing machine to store your cases. The kitchen is small but completely functional with everything you need  there’s no microwave but that wasn’t an issue as we cooked fresh every day. The lounge area is lovely and comfy and there is a small TV area for the kids to watch Netflix. The garden is gorgeous with a shaded outside dining area  lounging chairs and a hammock  there’s also a lovely little outside shower which we used constantly! Then the beach .. so beautiful! It’s virtually private and the sea is shallow for 50 meters or so and clear and warm. The kids were so safe and loved the 2 canoes provided. The sunsets are stunning as are the early mornings. You can walk to the lovely taverna in 5 mins along the beach  some of it is through the sea but it’s only shallow paddling and it’s gorgeous! We really cannot find any fault in this perfect holiday destination. It’s so peaceful! You’ll need to hire a car but this was east from Deals on wheels in Lefkimmi  it was waiting for us at the airport and wasn’t expensive (€315 for 1 wk in Aug) no hidden charges either! This is the best Airbnb we have ever stayed in See you next year! Xx Show more
10691883,Mark August 2019 A fantastic week. Home Maro is in a wonderful location right on the beach. Very well equipped with everything you need. A lovely welcome pack on arrival was very much appreciated. Great communication throughout. Remote location so a car is needed to explore the local area much of which is unspoilt and traditional which we loved. We really didn't want our week to end!
10691883,Francoise July 2019 Wonderful place!
10691883,Alison July 2019 We had a most relaxing week in this beautiful wee house. It was all we had hoped for and more. Being able to step out of the garden into the warm sea and then back for a shower and shade was just perfect. We fitted in a few trips - a cruise to Paxos  the ferry to the mainland and then Corfu town with bus back to Lefkimmi Port  a morning kayaking and snorkelling at Santa Barbara beach and a drive up to Chlomos. There was plenty else we could have done but the rest of the time we stayed close to home  the taverna and walks along to the salt marshes. Wishing we could have stayed much longer.
10691883,Anna July 2019 This place was so welcoming and comfortable that it exceeded our expectations all the way! It's serene and cozy. The beach  the shade by the house and ability to escape the heat at any moment makes vacation so enjoyable! Water was very warm any time of the day and night. Short walk to the beach tavern  short drive to the grocery store - your choice or scenic drive to Corfu town - you have plenty of options with a car. Place have acommodated our party of 5 adults and 11 year old. Special thanks to the hosts who are just great - very responsive and thoughtful. Should I mention beautiful sunsets?
10691883,Guy June 2019 Beautiful location on almost private beach. Great to have a Taverna so close. Used the kayak a couple of times. Some good other beaches not too far too. Must go to Mikronisi for a day and lunch. Also nice to drive along beach road north where you can also rent a boat for a day or less.
10691883,Alex May 2019 Home Maro is in a stunning location with the bottom of the garden being the beach. Home Maro itself is clean  well decorated and maintained. The nautical theme and use of local available materials is both clever and and visually pleasing. We recommend this well maintained home to anyone. Fantastic home  fantastic scenery!
10691883,Aurélien April 2019 Awesome guests  really nice and available!! The house is super cute  handy and comfortable! Would return over there with pleasure. Special plus for the garden and the amazing view on the sea and on the Greece.
10691883,Kate April 2019 This little house and beautiful garden are full of charm. Sand and the calm shallow sea are right there at the gate  and the bay is stunning. Our two small boys were in their element. We had spring dips in the sea  waded to the taverna along the shore  used the kayak that comes with the house and spent hours making sandcastles and collecting shells. There are some good places to eat at the fishing villages up the coast too  and Lefkimmi itself is lovely. We arrived to thoughtful welcome gifts and lots of warm hospitality. Highly recommended.
10691883,Ruth April 2019 If you are after a high quality  peaceful beach holiday in a safe environment then we couldn't recommend this beach house highly enough. The house was extremely stylish with all the amenities you could need. The location just next to a fabulous taverna was perfect and the village a short distance away so friendly and unspoiled. This is not a place ruined by tourist but a gem to appreciate and enjoy.
10691883,Georgina October 2018 A special holiday home perfect for a retreat. The beach was perfect for our children and couldn’t have been saver.
10691883,Caroline October 2018 Lovely beach retreat
10691883,Adam October 2018 A lovely house in a stunning location. It was well equipped with everything we needed for our stay. Spyridoula & Panagiota were great hosts and quick to respond to messages. Overall  highly recommended!
10691883,Ruth September 2018 This was our second stay at Home Maro and hope to visit again. Highly recommended  such a great location with the beach just through the garden gate. Everything we could wish for thoughtfully provided with some nice new touches. Spyridoula and Panagiota are so welcoming  helpful and hospitable  the perfect hosts. Recommended restaurant is Agrotica at Vitalades for great  cheap food grown on their farm. They do take away pizzas too.
10691883,Darina September 2018 This place is really magical and great for families with small children. There is a serious problem with wasps during the day and mosquitoes in the evening - bring good repellents plus make sure you keep the house doors closed at all times. The owners communicate really fast  late arrival and late check out wasnt any problem. We have recieved really nice welcoming basket and also asked for few breakfast things for the first morning which wasnt a problem as we were late arrival. There was few minor maintanance issues in the house. You have reall privacy in this place.
10691883,Jerry June 2018 T
10691883,Jan June 2018 What a fantastic place and what a fantastic hosts. Everything you wish for on your holiday. A really great place  straight at the waterfront of the shallow sea. Absolutely worth to go back sometime !!
10691883,Albert May 2018 It is a unique location! Directly situated at the sea  with a private beach  and a beautiful garden. We have enjoyed our stay with our tei little girls a lot and it was very relaxing hearing the waves. The taverne close by was very good. our little daughters liked the childrens playarea of a hotel a lot which was a 10 min walk from the house. Thanks a lot and I hope to be back oneday.
10691883,Maryjane April 2018 We had an amazing week in this beautiful beach house. The location is fantastic and we spent sunny days in the large welcoming garden  dipping in to the sea right at the front gate. We had a brilliant time exploring the lovely shallow water on the canoes. The house was clean and has everything you need with lovely comfortable beds. The hosts were so lovely and left a nice welcome basket for us. The village of Lefkimmi is traditional and very picturesque. As per other reviews a trip to the taverna just along the beach is a must. Really amazing food watching the sunset. Really hope to come back to this amazing house next year.
10691883,Juliette April 2018 The house was so cosy  beautifully decorated  comfortable beds and bedding  nice bathroom and kitchen  but the most amazing part is the view and having your own private beach at the end of the garden. There are 2 canoes/paddle boards and the sea is so shallow and warm. We stayed at Easter (1st week April) and the weather was perfect  the house warm and the kids (age 3 and 8) played on the beach all the time while we did stuff in the house  sat in the garden or on the loungers on the beach. It's so safe for kids as no one else really comes on the beach except the people staying in the few houses either side. The house has mossie blinds  but bring repellent as outside the little blighters are out from early evening. In all a perfect stay and we really didn't want to leave..
10691883,Chris October 2017 We had a wonderful  relaxing time at this beautiful and very quiet beach house. The pictures don’t do the space justice. The interior of the house is better than pictured for sure. The location was exactly what we wanted—totally off the beaten track  next to the beach (you can listen to the waves as you sleep)  and completely untouched by the scourge of crass tourist traps.  Lefkimmi (5 minutes drive away) is very cute and as authentic as you could expect. There are some great tavernas where you can feast on wonderful Greek food for unbelievably low prices  small bakeries and cafes where you can sip coffee next to locals. In short  this place is perfect for couples looking for a quiet getaway or families with young children (the water is calm and shallow). Keep in mind you will need a rental car to get around  and it will take about an hour to get to Corfu Town. But honestly we saw much of the island while we were there and we always felt this house and Lefkimmi were far better than any of the more developed tourist spots.
10691883,Bess October 2017 This really is a special place - if you are looking for a super cute house on the beach away from the crowds  look no further. Every morning we felt very lucky to be able to wake up and see the sea only meters from the front door  we never got bored of this! We stayed early October  and had four days of sun  and a couple of windy and cloudy days  but it really didn't matter. The sea was gloriously clear  the outdoor BBQ was brilliant  and the paddle boards were great fun. Having a good taverna 2 minutes along the beach was very convenient  the supermarket was only 5 minute drive too. Local village 3 minutes drive away where I'm sure there are nice cafes and streets to wander too  but if I'm honest we barely did more than swim in the sea (which we had to ourselves most days) and enjoy being in the house.. It was a pleasure to meet the lovely Spyridoula & Panagiota  and we're already planning our return :)
10691883,Ruth September 2017 Fantastic place to stay  right on the beach with everything you need in the house and a taverna a short walk along the beach. Much appreciated extra touches from our hosts Spyridoula  Panagiota and Yanis who were so welcoming  friendly and helpful. Beautiful location with spectacular scenery  safe beach  peaceful and quiet surroundings in a more traditional part of the island  away from main tourist areas . Perfect for a relaxing holiday by the sea.
10691883,Radim September 2017 We spent beautiful week in this house. Great view  great weather  shallow see   ideal for family with little kids. Lefkimmi is good place for those who want to spent quiet time  apart from other tourists.
10691883,Bartek September 2017 We spent great time here. it is perfect location for kids. Sea is shallow  so they can enjoy it. There is a shower in the garden. Beach is quiet and beautiful. We recommend this location.
10691883,"Daria July 2017 Beautiful greek village  house is wright on the beach near national park with pink flamingos and ""moon landscape""  the sea is very safe for kids and has amazing colours at the evening  all shops are close by Garden is amaizing  a lot of shadow you will enjoy any moment of the day there  and wont feel the heat! House is tastefull  has everything you need and what is very special  traditional and defenettely has soul Spyridoula is very friendly and will help you any time  we loved it!"
10691883,Babs Et Ale July 2017 If you want a relaxing vacation with direct access to the sea  this is an excellent option  in particular with children.
10691883,Petr July 2017 Excellent place  strongly recommend to everyone
10691883,Maresa June 2017 Lovely place to completely relax  right by the sea. Total peace & quiet. Fantastic sunsets  very friendly & helpful Taverna nearby.
10691883,Marcin June 2017 Family stay with 2.5yo and 5mo for 5 days.  Simply amazing place to be. Honestly  we couldn't be happier  one of the best places we stayed at  not only from our Airbnb xp but in general.  Gorgeous garden which will make you feel relaxed the moment you enter  and the gate to the sea which you will create fond memories of this place.  Quick stroll to taverna nearby and you can bring great food for your family :) to eat in your garden. Tavern is owned by very outgoing family that has gone beyond the restaurant menu to prep us breakfast we liked :)  Well equipped house  Fruits and wine as welcome gift from host :) water was super warm and shallow for the kids. Beautiful sunsets. I could go on and on.  Highly recommend Show more
10691883,Nick June 2017 The location of the house is lovely. It's out of the way  but easy to get to (if you follow the directions!)  we wanted a beach front house and this is exactly that. The water is lovely  warm with gentle waves. Lefkimmi has lots of restaurants nearby and our hosts were very helpful and also quick to reply when needed.
10691883,Alana June 2017 We had a lovely time at Home Maro. The house was perfect for our family of 4. The shallow  warm water was wonderful for the children and we made great use of the boats and outdoor grill. There is also a lovely taverna right down the beach. This rental is just right for a quiet week at the beach.
10691883,Kirstin April 2017 Great place for relaxing family holiday! Highly recommendable!
10691883,Erika April 2017 We stayed at Home Maro for a week with our four kids (7  6  5 and 2). This place is simply perfect for children. Do not hesitate a second if you get the chance to stay there. We had an awesome feeling with Spyridoula & Panagiota  they are super nice  super accommodating and very helpful. It was really good to meet them and they made us feel like home. We really hope to get the chance to come back someday !
10691883,Alexander October 2016 Had a wonderful stay at Spyridoula & Panagiotas place. Location was great  beach and sea were superb. The sea is perfect for little children. Rooms - clean  tasteful and outside a nice terace. Thank you we loved our stay.
10691883,Matan October 2016 Home Maro was simply perfect for us.  We’ve been travelling a lot  but this was the first time we’d travelled with a child  and the place was exactly what we needed. Spyridoula was very easy to communicate with and is very responsive  and met us find the house and settle in. They filled the cupboards and fridge with treats and gave us a few tips for our stay.  The area is off the beaten track and the coastline is beautiful  and we had all we needed in the house and right outside it’s door. The house is right on the beach  5 steps from where the sea begins. The sea in Lefkimmi is warm and calm  the beach is sandy and soft  and the house has canoes  water mattresses  beach beds  toys and other gear you can use in the water. The garden has a warm shower to rinse the sand in  a great place to dine in and a wonderful grill. The interior is designed very nicely and there’s a good feeling no matter where you are in the house. There is a very nice taverna 80 meters from the house  and the nearest supermarket is a 10 minute drive away (though there is a grocery shop that’s closer).  We had a such a great time  that we’re already planning our trip back! Show more
10691883,Mouloud September 2016 This is a very homely lovely house which is on the beach you cannot beat that. The hostesses were extraordinary very kind and helpful. Thanks a lot ladies. We will be back... M&E!
10691883,Suzi September 2016 We had a fabulous week here. The sisters are amazingly helpful and easy to communicate with. Nothing was too much trouble. Very pretty and clean beach house  initially used by the family growing up for their summer holidays  but now re-done and decorated by the girls. Peaceful  unspoilt  friendly  safe and very comfortable...blissful location. Sea calm  warm and shallow for swimming for hours. So safe for children  but deeper for serious swimming a further 50 metres out. Swim  whenever you want  from outside the gate! Amazing! Best to hire a car  ideally with Sat Nav  from the airport. Its a straightforward and picturesque journey along the coast. We had a few days out  but thought the house and location nicer than anywhere else we visited  that we stayed at the house most days. My elderly Mum was with me and although she walks using a stick  and is slow  she didn't have a problem accessing the house along the beach  daily. Mosquito nets on all all windows and doors  if you need them  reliable speedy internet  BBQ area  and the hot shower area in the garden  when you leave the beach  is fabulous. Large fridge freezer  coffee maker  oven and hob. Great seating areas - either at the table for breakfast under the awning  siesta in the deckchairs  or in the hammock  or relax on the sunloungers on the beach  after a langurous swim. Wonderful sunrises over the mountains of Albania plus stunning sunsets over Corfu to admire from the house or whilst supping a cold beer or coffee at Spiro's friendly  casual and relaxed Taverna 100m along the beach  for locals and the few tourists alike. Its also where you park your car. Lefkimmi village 2 miles up the road is charming  with a one way system around the main part. Modern and old co-existing so well together - people  traditions and architecture. Wander amongst the back streets to savour the real Greece. Locals really friendly. Try the local bakery  coffee shop selling a choice of coffee and grind levels  local grocers  and spotlessly clean butchers. Wine at 15 euros in the local wine shop  complete with barrel outside. Fresh Fish available from a van along from the turning on certain days of the week. 3 supermarkets  1 mile north of Lefkimmi  are extremely well stocked  but dont miss out on buying from the local shops in Lefkimmi village/town too  and dining at the recommended restaurant   just before you turn right down to the beach and house. Plenty of other beaches to explore 20 mins away on the West coast  via pretty rural villages. The cosmopolitan and rich historical town of Corfu itself also worth a visit. We will definitely come back here again for another magical and relaxed holiday. Can highly recommend it for couples/families  if you want to sample the real & peaceful Corfu  and like to get away from the crowds and most other tourists! Thank you so much to the lovely Spyridoula & Panagiota. Show more
10691883,Qianjun September 2016 Home Maro is a paradise! Peaceful  private  the entire beach is just our own. House is with heart warming decoration  and absolutely everything one needs! There is no more details-attended owners than Spyridoula sisters! One day the shower cabin pipe got stuck because we brought too much sand inside  they responded to our concern immediately and came from Corfu town the next day  fixed the problem  and also brought lamb which was cooked by their mother. All neighbors are very kind  offered us immense help! In every sense we felt like home! Garden is lovely! Besides having meals  chats  reading on the hammock  we also enjoyed yoga practice in the garden  totally in union with the nature!
10691883,Robin August 2016 We had a wonderful and relaxing experience. We were met at the airport and Spyridoula allowed us to follow her  in our rental car  to the beach house. The house was beautiful  well kept  and more than we expected. The beach and everything was really fantastic. We would just like to thank them for such a beautiful holiday.
10691883,Eyal August 2016 The house is just perfect for a peaceful vacation. We enjoyed an almost private beach (most of the time we were the only people around) in front of the nice front yard. The sunsets are beautiful  the sea is clean and calm and the canoes (freely available at the house) were great! The house is spacious  well-decorated and equipped with everything you need. You can buy groceries at the nearby village or eat at taverns. Reaching the house requires a short walk on the beach but that's not an issue at all. Corfu town is less than 1 hr drive and so are most of the more famous beaches and landmarks but these are packed with many tourists so don't waste your time - enjoy the beautiful and picturesque house  you don't need anything else for a perfect vacation. Spyridoula was very kind and helpful and did everything to make our stay a remarkable experience!
10691883,Ingrid July 2016 We spent the last 10 days in this beautiful location and loved it.The house is charming and provides all the comfort you need and the setting is amazing.A sweep of sandy beach  warm shallow water and few people   we were often the only people in the water. The sunsets are beautiful and we were lucky enough to see porpoises. One does need a car as the nearest village is a distance away.This is the perfect spot for those who want peace and tranquility.  Spyridoula and her family were fantastic hosts and went out of their way to make us welcome  their kindness was overwhelming.  I cannot recommend this accommodation enough for us it was perfect we loved the location and the fact that it is remote and tourist free.There is one Taverna very close to the house and many more a short drive away the surrounding villages are lovely.  We will most definitely return  I left my heart at Home Maro. Response from Spyridoula & Panagiota August 2016 Thank you very much for your nice words.We are very glad meeting you and you are more than welcomed whenever like!!!
10691883,Selina May 2016 The house Maro is a wonderful place. It is very quiet and relaxing. Our hosts were wonderful. They provided us with all kinds of information  welcomed us with fresh fruits and wanted to make sure we had a nice holiday. The house itself was very clean and nicely decorated. With wine branches and typical greek decorating. The kitchen is provided with everything you need. If you're not into cooking theres also a little nice tavern where you can watch the sunset. We had such a wonderful and relaxing time at the little house by the sea. Thank you very much Spyrodoula & Panagiota!
10691883,Amandine November 2022 A sweet stay … Home Maro's reputation is no longer valid. Everything is perfect. Our host is more than responsive  she responded at any time we needed her! The house is about 1hr from the airport and a big city. You have to appreciate the calm and for now you will love it! The house is as pictured  waterfront and 10 minutes from Lefkimi. Thank you for your kindness and hospitality! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Christian October 2022 a bit lost away from highways and towns   a lovely place with a small port next door. tranquility by the water of happiness Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Simon July 2022 Perfect stay in paradise. Small but perfectly arranged house that can accommodate our family of 2 adults and 3 children without problem. Perfect decor  quality bedding  full of basic things left at your disposal and small surprise welcome gifts on arrival. The garden is magical  invites you to relax and rest with a small gate overlooking the sandy beach and sea. Simply fabulous. The kayaks and games available are a real plus especially with children. This part of the island is more wild and requires less time to discover no culpability to see hours pass by in the hammock. Tip though  the micro nisi beach restaurant comes and its fabulous fish. Finally  spyridoula is perfectly kind and responsive. Top host. Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Jeremie April 2022 We had a wonderful stay at spyridoula and Panagiota's place which have always been very available. The decor is neat  the accommodation very clean. The location is really idyllic and the outdoor layout invites you to relax. We spent a week there with 2 small children and highly recommend this destination. Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Max October 2021 Everything in the other reviews is true. A very clean house which is also regularly maintained  even things that quickly become clammy are super clean Silicon grout in the bathroom and shower curtain)  We were there in October and had a lot of mosquitoes  bad luck with the weather and the session was slowly over what you noticed in the restaurants all around... but the accommodation can't do anything for that.  The house gets 5/5 especially great for families with small children  our (2 & 5) loved it. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Pauline August 2021 A little slice of heaven in the middle of nowhere... there is the sky  the sea at the end of the garden ... The cottage is simple but decorated with care and with all the amenities you need (air conditioning  Nespresso machine washing machine) The small stretch of beach has the immense privilege of being only for us the warm sea and the horizon that for us. We have a walk everywhere (perfect for children not for divers) the children embark on the canoes available to go for a leisurely walk... There is a small restaurant accessible by walking along the beach ... Everything is done to cut yourself off from the world ... Which is perfect because Corfu doesn't offer so much. And Spyridoula is charming  attentive and discreet That's my very definition of an Airbnb Superhost ! To be treasured (secret) Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Emeline July 2021 Very nice and comfortable house by the beach. Small touches awaited us in the fridge. We had a very relaxing stay. It's really a plus to be able to swim at any time of day  or use the kayaks available. Great stay! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Sabine October 2020 Fantastic location  nice clean house with nice details  equipped with everything you need and friendly  easily accessible hosts. In dry weather a wonderful place to relax  with ongoing rainfall like in my days I was missing a covered place to sit outside anyway. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Chris September 2020 Overall  we wouldn't go back. Too bad because we were so looking forward to it and there are so many good reviews here. Yes  the beach on the doorstep is super beautiful. But there is also a lot of trash on the beach. Outside you could hardly make yourself comfortable  as many mosquitoes are there in the evening and wasps are there during the day. The cottage is very clean  but not really comfortable and tight at the end of the day. Especially when the weather is bad. The value for money doesn't match. The hostess is very eager and nice. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Lamy August 2020 Extremely relaxing stay due to the magical location of the house  the sea behind the gate. Love the high quality outdoor layout ( dining area  deckchairs  canoes). We live outside ! We visited the island a little but we could have stayed enjoying the garden and the beach without moving : books  going back into the very hot sea  an extremely pleasant outdoor shower  the only sound of the sea to fall asleep. A small house that's tasteful and functional  with a very responsive host. It had everything for the barbecue but we preferred to discover all the good taverns. Three nearby are excellent : Aristo  Savas  and Limnopoula. A car is required to reach them. A great stay ! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Clémentine August 2020 Wonderful holiday home where everything was absolutely perfect! Translated from French  Show original

10691883,Wolfgang October 2018 Cozy little cottage  sufficient for 4 people  but they need to know each other well. Unlikely good location  right by the sea  paradise beautiful  had a week's holiday and only sun. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Christine September 2018 We spent a wonderful week in Lefkimmi in this beautiful cottage. Every morning we could have breakfast right by the sea and enjoy the tranquility. At the beach you are almost alone. We were very warmly welcomed by our landlords. Everything had been thought of  even a welcome basket with food for the first day was ready! Thank you very much! The house is very lovingly and beautifully decorated. There is also an outdoor shower  so you can take a shower after a dip. A barbecue and canoes are also available. We really highly recommend this cottage. Thank you for the great week! Christine with family Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Fabien July 2018 Our second stay was as pleasant as the first  we found the little house right on the water. The absolute calm of the place and the almost private beach once again delighted us. The welcome was very pleasant. The creation of the parking is a plus to get to the house even though I loved the a little wild side that forced us to reach the house through the beach. Thanks to our hosts and maybe see you next year. Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Eva July 2018 A house in a perfect quiet spot  away from the hustle and bustle. A mild beach suitable for children. Perfectly equipped  including a bathroom  kitchen  and children's toys. Suitable for relaxing with kids. Rent-a-car is required. Translated from Czech  Show original
10691883,Daniel June 2018 Everything positive is true in the previous reviews. But it is even better on site than in the pictures and in the description. Super friendly and helpful hosts. A well-equipped house that was furnished with a lot of love. A beautiful  well-kept garden with plenty of space (sun and shade). At any time of the day  the fantastic view of the beach and sea  right outside your own garden door. Wave noise  sunsets  the play of colors during the day  the view over the nightly bay  and   and ... In short: we had a perfect week by the sea and wanted to stay even longer. This is how vacation has to be! Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Natasha May 2018 Wonderful place right with access to the sea! Responsive and accommodating host! Thank you for everything! Translated from Russian  Show original
10691883,Femke May 2018 Home Maro is a piece of paradise on earth. Wake up and see the sea.... watching the sun go down in the evening. The cottage is charming and has all the basics you need  nice that there are screens and doors everywhere so you don't have to be bothered by the mosquitoes. We have made great use of the canoes  swam a lot (fine in early May) and look back on a wonderful vacation. Translated from Dutch  Show original
10691883,Julie & Yann April 2018 We had a great week at this house right on the water. Our daughters were able to enjoy the beach and kayaks made available safely as there is very little background. The water was very good this time of year and we had a swim every day! Thanks to Spyridoula & Panagiota for their attentive welcome and Makis for picking us up from the airport at a more than late hour. In the vicinity of the house  we recommend the Pétrakis tavern at the end of the beach  for its very friendly welcome  and also the Panorama tavern in Notos (a 20-minute drive) which also allows you to enjoy a beautiful garden and beach! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Marianne Houen October 2017 A really lovely place and stay; we were met at the airport and walked to the house even though we arrived very late; it was really lovely. Snacks and drinks were here-and some bread that the kids had when they woke up early the next day. Really thoughtful.  The house is right on the water-sandy beach with low water  which was perfect as a family with three kids. The two kayaks were used diligently - amazing.  The house had what we needed - beds  kitchen  washing machine  bathroom  wifi and a couch to relax on. But otherwise  most of the awake time spent in the garden and on the beach right outside the gate; it was nicely undeterred here in the outer season.  We used the local restaurant a lot - both for lunch and evening - and were also on trips on the island and to nearby Lefkimmi.  All in all a fantastic holiday - and a super base for this which we can highly recommend! Thank you. Show more Translated from Danish  Show original
10691883,Gabriele October 2017 It is a nice place  especially for a family with small children  quiet and safe  the pictures don't lie  the hosts are lovely and very helpful. Good swimmers might be annoyed: you have to wade through shallow water for a long time until it's really fun. But there are wonderful sunsets for this... Definitely necessary: a car. No supermarket is in walking distance and only a tavern. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Fabien July 2017 We had a lovely week. The house is very nice  the shaded garden is divine for eating... And the sea is just 1 meter from the house. Absolute calm  deserted beach and the water is very shallow which is great for children. A place to remember! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Alrik May 2017 We had a wonderful honeymoon in this  really unique  place. The 2 weeks directly on the beach have flown by.  Efcharisto Spưoula! You're a super nice  helpful host :) Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Anne-Sophie April 2017 We loved our stay! The house is ideally located  on the edge of a secluded page and very sparse. It feels like you're alone in the world! The house is well equipped  clean  nicely appointed. The owners are very careful  even offering to pick you up from the airport which is still an hour's drive away. They even have enough to fill the fridge the first night. Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Marion October 2016 It was a great place to stay in a quiet and natural location The hosts were very warm and welcomed us nicely  they were quickly available for questions. We will surely enjoy vacation in this house again. Translated from German  Show original
10691883,Stanislas September 2016 We had a great time at Spyridoula and Panagiota's house. Their welcome was very pleasant  they were attentive throughout our week in the house. Beforehand  she responded to all our requests very quickly which is really convenient. The house is perfect: in very good condition  clean  functional and well-equipped! The garden is shaded which allows you to be cool. The location is fabulous: we are really on a sandy beach  not very busy. And in a car  there are all the necessary shops. We had a lovely stay at home maro! And we'll be happy to go back! Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Patricia August 2016 Home Maro was our little slice of heaven for a week of real vacation. How nice it is to have breakfast with the sea as your horizon and to have only a dozen steps to go for a swim! The sea is shallow and the water always warm  making it an ideal playground for children who can't swim. The older ones will also have a lot of fun watching the small fish and canoeing (masks  snorkels and canoes are provided by the house). Spyridoula & Panagiota are remarkable  warm  ultra-responsive and attentive hosts. Beyond a basket - very - filled with local specialties  they had even provided little gifts for the kids! All necessary cleaning products are available. Same for hygiene products  bath and hand towels and bed linens. Polite Efcharisto  Spyridoula & Panagiota! The quality of the hospitality alone would be enough to recommend this rental. If you add the clean characteristics of the house (beautifully decorated  functional  fresh (we didn't have to use the air conditioning)  good bedding  etc.) and its dream location  you may be tempted to keep this excellent address for yourself! P.S. The house next door has the same type of features and S & P knows the owner. The 2 houses can then be rented for a vacation with others but where everyone can be at home - and have their own private beach! Show more Translated from French  Show original
10691883,Othmar July 2016 Our hosts were very friendly and likeable...... The arrival was very warm  helpful with a welcome gift and a very well prepared introduction......

Translated from German  Show original Response from Spyridoula & Panagiota August 2016 Thank you very much for your nice words !You are more than welcomed whenever you like!!!
10691883,Cécile June 2016 We had a great week at HOME MARO! Spyridoula was waiting for us at the airport despite the late time of our arrival. We enjoyed Spyridoula's availability before and during our stay to answer our questions or advise us. The house is charming  well-equipped as described. The internet speed is not very fast but sufficient to check emails. The place is quiet and really exotic  we only walk to the house by the beach (bring suitable shoes)! The island is beautiful and the corfiotes are very welcoming. We recommend the PETRAKIS tarverne near the house. To enjoy the stay  it is essential to have a car. We have great memories of our stay at HOME MARO! Thanks to Spyridoula for hosting us.

29914136,Tanja October 2022 The stay in Aris Bungalow was fantastic. The Bungalow is located directly next to the Akron Beach. The communication with Aris was perfect. He helped us to organize a trip to Paxos. The check in and check out was without any problem. If I would come back to Corfu i would stay again with Aris. Thank you!
29914136,Peter September 2022 A perfect place for a beach vacation in summer!
29914136,Catherine September 2022 Great apartment  lovely location and excellent service.
29914136,Victoria September 2022 Myself  my husband and nearly 2 year old had a fab stay here  it was s close the beach and everyone was so friendly and welcoming. As others have said  you need to book sunbeds but the staff go the extra mile for you when you're staying here. Loads of great restaurants around  including Akron beach bar. Loads of space for the 3 of us and the air con in the bedrooms was much appreciated!
29914136,Giles & Jo September 2022 We had a lovely stay in the bungalow and everyone was very helpful (especially George). The location is perfect in this less developed part of the island and as the listing suggests  just 50m max from the beach. The location of Akron beach bar/restaurant  set on Agia Triada beach is truly stunning and once you drop down the short  steep drive  it was like another world. The bungalow was very clean and has everything you need inc. a/c in the bedrooms. We would defiantly book again.
29914136,Brian August 2022 Aris is great to work with. His bungalow was perfect for our family of four. The location is amazing located right next to the beautiful Akron Beach Club. Easy access to boating trips and hiking trails as well. Hike to Lacones if you have time. We will be returning!
29914136,Mark August 2022 Beautiful beach  literally 50m away. Good restaurant and stunning views. Sunbeds and banana boats. Party feel to the beach. Make sure you book your sunbeds before you arrive in Greece  as they book up early. Aris was very attentive. Would recommend.
29914136,Valerie August 2022 We had an amazing time at Aris place. He is a great host. The bungalow belongs to Akron beach bar and all the staff treated us with priority when it came to Reservation for beach beds or Tables. Its super pretty there. Just 1 Minute walk to do a dip in the sea and enjoy the sun. Everywhere are good Restaurants  Supermarket and cafes in walking Distance.  Just the Internet isn't stable enough to properly work from there. The bungalow is really beautful furnished and prepared.
29914136,Emma August 2022 If you’re looking to base yourself just footsteps from paleokastritsa‘s best accessible beach  look no further. Light-filled and with a surprisingly spacious terrace  it’s the perfect beachside bolthole. And the beautiful Akron beach bar and restaurant is the cherry on the top (make sure to book ahead with your loungers for the beach  as it does get busy). Finally  special mention to George at Akron  who was so helpful and welcoming to our family during our stay - thank you!
29914136,Mark August 2022 This was a brilliant location the beach is very close by excellent for snorkelling and water sports. Three food places near the beach. Need to book early if you want sun lounger or sun bed. Aris and his team are very helpful.
29914136,Jessica July 2022 Excellent accommodation and amazing location - steps from the beach & Akron beach bar  as well as within walking distance to lots of nice Tavernas in the village. Aris and his staff were very nice and so helpful. Would recommend!
29914136,Alev July 2022 Perfect location  excellent communication  great bungalow! Everything about the stay was perfect! Especially waking up in the morning and going directly to the sea. The sea was the one of the best in Corfu and so was Akron Beach. The bungalow was exceptionally clean  even cleaner than my own apartment 😊 The veranda was big and comfortable. Some days we stayed at home  sunbathing on the veranda and goong to the beach on our doorstep.This was one of the best airbnb stays that we had so far! Recommend to everyone! Great value for money!
29914136,Georgina June 2022 This is the perfect place for a very relaxing holiday. Only wished we’d booked for longer!  The Akron beach bar is an amazing location and place to hang out in the sun; enjoying the sea and beautiful views.  Do not worry about noise from the bar - the bungalow so quiet and comfortable!
29914136,Lucille June 2022 The location of the apartment is great because there is a beautiful beach and a nice beachclub. However it is quiet far from other things on the island  like Corfu-town.  The apartment was nice and tidy. Enough space for 4 people and a nice terrace also!
29914136,Alexey June 2022 The bungalow is perfect indeed! It’s located 30 meters from the beach; the beach itself is a mix of sand and stones. The sea and the nature in the lagoon are extraordinarily picturesque. The house has two bedrooms  one with a large double bed and another with two single beds; both are equipped with air conditioners. The appliances are functional and new; there is a washing machine. The team of the Akron beach complex is incredible: they instantly fulfilled all requests. The sunbeds are in high demand  so I recommend booking in advance. Highly recommend this place!
29914136,Shannon May 2022 We were the first to stay here and it was beyond our expectations! It’s situated right by their beach bar and was walking distance to the water. The most beautiful bay in all of Corfu! Great location and situation for the price.
29914136,Sharon October 2021 WONDERFUL PLACE TO CHILL Great opportunity to take life at your own pace. The choice of beach on the doorstep or lovely couple of tavernas to have delicious food. One owned by Aris  Akron beach bar is spotless with kind friendly staff who will go that extra mile to ensure a wonderful time. Highly recommended 👌
29914136,Brooks September 2021 Wow! What a great experience. Aris was a great host. From check in to checkout we wanted for nothing. The house is as advertised. It was the perfect place to relax after a day of activities. Even better is the fact that Aris owns the beach bar/restaurant that is on the beach 50m away. There are lots of activities and the upscale beach restaurant is really good. Aris and his staff were always eager to assist with anything. I can’t recommend this enough.
29914136,Emily September 2021 Wonderful place to stay and Aris was a great host. The bungalow is clean  private with great access to the beach. We spent two weeks here and enjoyed all aspects. Excellent location for going to many beaches in Corfu.
29914136,Richard August 2021 Aris was a brilliant host and his bungalow is perfect for a stay in Paleo. 1 minute walk to a beautiful beach and Akron Beach bar. Well worth it
29914136,Duncan July 2021 We booked two weeks in Aris' Beach Bungalow. We have a family of 4 with 14yr and 12yr old daughters. Aris is a spectacularly great person. He was fantastic to deal with and always asking if he could assist to make the stay better. He provided priority bookings and accommodations with Akron's - an upmarket restaurant and beach bar with pool  which he runs in addition to the bungalows. He was close on hand for any issues and discussion - even social ones  being based at Akrons. The accommodation is simple  but perfect for our break. It is literally 40m from the water's edge  on what we would say is one of the special (best) beaches of Corfu. The internet in the area near the bungalow was weak on Vodafone  but there is wifi in for the accommodation. I expect this was shared across multiple accommodations as I could do limited work (emails etc)  but voice calls only (no video) were a challenge even on Whattsapp. Sometimes it would be fine  othertimes not. Just a caution on expectations which is important. I would highly recommend Aris' bungalow for a beach holiday.
29914136,Masha July 2021 Perfect place!
29914136,Jennifer July 2021 My family and I stayed at the bungalow for 4 nights and had a fabulous time. The location is amazing  service was great  the restaurant was delicious. We can't say enough. Aris is a most gracious host and helped with any questions we had. He helped with restaurant recommendations  taxis etc. He helped us put together an awesome boat trip with Yiannis which I would also recommend.
29914136,Mark Tony June 2021 Aris bungalow was super convenient. Simple  no fuss and had everything for a casual stay. We stayed 10 nights  and had an amazing time. Beach was super close... really elegant beach bar  which was chilled and no loud music...very relaxing. Aris and his team are super nice  helped with everything we needed  and allowed us to use the lounges on the beach whenever we wanted. Highly recommended. Thanks Aris and team!
29914136,Nina September 2020 Enjoyed our stay at Akron Villas. Fantastic location and staff at Akron beach bar were so accommodating and lovely. Stunning location.
29914136,Louise August 2020 We had the most amazing time at Aris’ place. The location is amazing  particularly if  like us  you enjoy a good beach bar/restaurant. You are steps away from I suspect the best one on the island! And yet the apartment is super quiet and private. Also only minutes away from La Grotta bar  which is fun  and lovely beaches you can only access by boat.  Akron is perfect - lovely staff  delicious food (the quinoa salad is amazing as well as the grilled fresh fish and great  although quite limited  children’s menu) and cocktails  quiet pool  serviced loungers on pebbly but beautiful beach.... I could go on! I would be very surprised if there is a better option on the island - we certainly didn’t find it! Really lovely with children too.  The apartment is set back from the beach (stunning - with some water sports and sea taxis/boat hire  but still quiet and gorgeous views)  but only a minute’s walk. It is perfectly located for people wanting a base for exploring Corfu or who want to spend most of their time relaxing on the beach. Whilst the apartment is super clean and spacious (with large wraparound terrace) there are no views and it is not somewhere to hang out all day - not when you are on the doorstep of an amazing beach bar anyway!  All facilities were great (hot water  air con  comfy beds  lots of storage  all super clean  etc) and Aris is really welcoming and helpful. We had no issues at all  but I have no doubt he would have sorted anything v quickly. Nice touches such as good quality local shower gel  shampoo  etc. Good screens to ensure no mossies get in.  The restaurant and beach staff all wore masks etc and we felt very safe from a Covid perspective. They were also lovely and you feel a bit of a VIP as you are staying so they start to know you and will reserve your loungers etc!  I would go back in a heartbeat! We all loved it! Show more
29914136,Cristina August 2020 We can’t recommend this place highly enough. We had a fantastic week with our 4 and 1 year old daughters. The location is brilliant  only a few steps from the beach. What it makes it so fantastic is Aris and his wife Elena- they are excellent  helpful and welcoming hosts. They go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. The beach club/restaurant is also run by them and it’s fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly  professional  knowledgeable and nice and the food absolutely great quality and delicious. It is also a very children friendly place which also made a difference This place is a hidden Gem Thank you Very much Aris and Elena for an unforgettable holiday.
29914136,Catherine August 2020 Lovely setting so close to a lovely cove like beach. Excellent restaurant. Bungalow very bright and spacious
29914136,Jo August 2020 Lovely beach bungalow only a few steps from the beach with the areas best beach bar and restaurant. Great host and friendly team made our stay extra special.
29914136,Steve September 2019 Top quality apartment and excellent beach bar. Aris and his team were always available and couldn’t do any more to help us enjoy a wonderful holiday. George and Stefanos looked after us everyday at the beach and gave excellent local knowledge of things to do. The area in which Akron beach and apartment is situated is the best in Paleokastritsa and there are many local tavernas and shops to explore. Would highly recommend.
29914136,Stavria September 2019 The beach bungalow is located just steps away from Akron beach Bar. Ari and his exceptional staff took great care of our family and made sure we felt like home during our 5days stay. We had the beach bar at our fingertips  providing excellent service  gorgeous beach and delicious menu. We highly recommend and plan to visit again soon. Response from Aris September 2019 Thanks for the tips Stevi  Kostas (chef) thanks you and sends his regards.
29914136,Marina September 2019 Great place to stay. Has all you need. Nice and private area with a big terrace. Loved being so close to the beach. Akron beach bar has a great atmosphere and delicious food.
29914136,Sonja September 2019 Akron bungalow is a beautiful place near the picturesque beach and amazing beach bar. Aris is a great host and he is always there when you need him. If you are on Corfu this is the place to stay!
29914136,"Stefani August 2019 We spent 3 days in Corfu at this spectacularly located bungalow. It was a stone's throw away from the beach  the famous ""La Grotta""  and a handful of great restaurants. The thing we liked the best though  was how private the property was. Even though it was really near all of those amenities  it was also tucked far back enough on the property that it gave a real sense of privacy. Also  Aris and his wife Elena were gracious hosts and all of their staff at the Akron Beach Bar were super friendly and helpful as well. If I ever go back to Corfu I would definitely choose to stay at the bungalow again!"
29914136,Tim July 2019 Highly recommend. The location is amazing. Just a few steps from the beautiful pebble and rock beach which was great for swimming  diving and snorkelling. A nice large  and pleasantly private  terrace area for lounging  with large dining table for al-fresco eating. The Akron beach bar and restaurant  right on the doorstep  is a very stylish place to spend time  and great for a special meal. Excellent food and service  and definitely a significant step above the other (perfectly decent) bars/tavernas in the area. Aris and his team were very welcoming  responsive and nothing was too much trouble for them. On a practical note  there's a choice of small supermarkets and tavernas within easy walking distance. Boat/kayak/SUP/pedalo rental available from the beach  plus water taxi to alternative beaches. Everything you could want or need. Loved it.
29914136,Erwin July 2019 The best is  you are near the best reelaxing Beachbar and Resteraunt.
29914136,Craig July 2019 You will not find a better location on Corfu ... we spend several of ours days visiting other beaches and discovered that we were staying in the best location (paleo) ... the Akron set up pool  beach and service was excellent
29914136,Wiebke June 2019 Aris place was just the perfect place for our vacation. The bungalow is clean and well furnished. A large terrasse surrounded by trees to chill out after the beach. The beach is only 20 m away. Aris beach bar and restaurant Acron beach is located on this beach. A great place to eat and have a drink by the way. Aris and his wife have welcomed us there when we arrived late in the evening. They were very friendly hosts. Whenever we needed an advise they gave us good tips what to visit or where to have dinner etc. I hope we will have the chance to come back to stay at Aris place one day!
29914136,Sarah August 2021 Very nice bungalow a short walk to the beach. And what a beach! The water is beautiful. Special mention goes to Aris  Georges and the Akron teams who have given us the best welcome. P.S. If you're a lounging enthusiast and go in high season  consider booking your deckchairs a few days in advance. Translated from French  Show original
29914136,Sylvie July 2021 Perfect! A very pleasant accommodation: air-conditioned rooms  magnificent terrace  small safe   private parking... all this a few meters from one of the very pretty beaches of Palaiokastritsa. After your day of walking  you can enjoy a beautiful sun lounger with your toes in the water while having your little aperitif while watching the sun go down. Aris and his team are extremely kind and do everything to satisfy you. The restaurant is excellent and a little problem less if you need to do a test for your return  the doctor is coming to you! Happiness. Translated from French  Show original
29914136,Caroline September 2020 Great  fully equipped cottage just a few tens of meters from the sea. The location is great  is next to a great restaurant /pool /private beach belonging to the owner  where we spent so much time we were nice . We'll be happy to go back!

17550859,Konrad September 2022 If you are looking for a villa with beautiful sunsets  this one is perfect for you. The pool is very large and the pool beds are comfortable. The villa is very large and even a large group of people will feel comfortable there. Each room has its own bathroom and wardrobe. There are 3 restaurants in the area and they offer really very tasty food.  Within 20-30 minutes by car you will find many great beaches  especially Agios Gordios is impressive  but the almost private Prasoudi Beach and the large sandy Halikounas Beach are also charming.  In the nearby Ag. Mattheos there is great supermarket with good prices and very well stocked. The villa has its own grill in the garden  we used it several times.  Summary: we were very satisfied  sunsets from Villa are beautiful.
17550859,Katie September 2022 The villa is spacious and airy and clean. The pool area and seating is good and great sunsets! There is a small beach 2 min walk away where you can hire loungers and parasols  boats  pedalos  paddle boards and kayaks. On the walk down to the beach you pass 3 restaurants  all of which are good. The nearest town is about 3km away and uphill  so is walkable once but not daily! We therefore learnt quickly that you need a car to make the most of this villa. The host arranged a transfer from the airport for us and back again at the end of our stay. We arrived late so we were not met at the property but the host was in regular contact and was very helpful. The cleaner came mid way through our stay as did the pool man. Lovely place to get away from it all.
17550859,Michael April 2022 We had an outstanding stay at Villa Cosembeli and the pictures on the website don't do the place justice.... it is simply amazing.  Where to start? The Villa is perfect for large groups and has all the space needed..... we were a group of 12 with 6x kids aged from 2-10 and they had the most amazing time playing in the pool and on the lovely nearby beach.  The hosts were great and everything was taken care of - great communication throughout the process.  The area of Paramonas is stunning with the the most amazing sunsets and a great little Taverna stumbling distance from the Villa.  I would highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a 5* Villa off the beaten track with amazing views and warm hospitality!
17550859,Anna September 2021 Villa Cosambelli is a wonderful  luxurious villa. We’ve just had an excellent two week break and boy were we able to relax!  The villa has fantastic views  in a lovely quiet area just beyond the mountains. The villa benefits from being a few minutes walk from the beach (where you can rent sun loungers and umbrellas for very little) as well as a lovely taverna and hotel restaurant (which the public can use).  The villa is well equipped with four double bedrooms each with their own en-suite. We even commented that each room was the same size as good sized one bedroom flats in London! 😂. Both floors have their own lounge area and kitchen.  We experienced some wonderful walks in the area; our favourite was the walk through the olive groves to Lake Korission (approx 1hr 45mins walk from the villa).  Villa Cosambelli is well situated to the west of the island  which means you can reach most areas of the island in under an hour. I would highly recommend renting a car as the villa is quite remote. Please also hire only from reputable hire companies as we were massively stung by our hire company. However  this was another massive plus to our hosts who quickly sorted the issue with the car rental company  when were unable to.  All in all  a fantastic holiday and a wonderful villa! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Show more
17550859,James August 2021 The Villa is wonderful. Incredible views and outstanding sunsets. Paramonas is quiet  but had everything we need/want: one minute walk to the beach  two reasonably priced tavernas within 3 mins walk and the larger village of Agios Mattheos (with a few mini-markets) only 5-10 mins drive away. We loved every minute. The sea was so warm  the Villa so well presented with all the amenities. And the hosts were excellent: great communicators  very supportive and very hospitable (meet  depart etc). We would love to return. Thanks
17550859,Ionut August 2021 The location was excellent  the host very nice and willing to help us all the time  while the villa was more than perfect. We hope to come back soon.
17550859,Linh July 2021 Wonderful hotel!!
17550859,Paul August 2019 We spent a wonderful week of holiday in villa Cosambelli during august 2019. Paramonas is a quiet place without too many tourists but very closed to beautiful beaches. Everything was perfect  the villa is beautiful  well-appointed and very clean. The view of the sunset from the villa is really amazing. All the family enjoyed the swimming-pool. On site  the father of Antonios was very kind and helpful.
17550859,Hakim May 2019 The villa is beautiful and the place ideally placed for a good stay. We had a great holiday. I especially thank George for his kindness and hospitality.
17550859,Benjamin April 2019 Despite being early in the season before the weather really heated up we had a fabulous time. Villa was perfect  well appointed and very clean. Antonio was great at communicating before and during stay. Views at sunset were amazing. Certainly worth having a car and exploring some of the tavernas along the coast and up in some of the local villages. Highly recommend.
17550859,Karen October 2018 This villa was everything and more quiet location close to the beach and 3 taverna’s. The hosts were great and quick to respond. Only thing I would recommend is a car to explore the rest of the island. Other wise an awesome holiday and would definitely recommend.
17550859,Julie September 2018 Villa Cosambeli is a truly beautiful house in a stunning location. The 4 double bedrooms with modern en suite bathrooms meant that our party of 7 were all very happy with their holiday. Well equipped kitchens  beautiful dining and sitting spaces and a fabulous outside pool area made this a holiday to remember. The villa has incredible sea views and is only a very short walk from the beach. We had 3 taverna’s to choose from on our doorstep - all were good but Taverna Plori was our particular favourite. Panamonas is in a quieter  less touristy part of the island but busier areas were easy to reach by car and scooter. Our host  Antonios  was very helpful both before and throughout our holiday.
17550859,Roger September 2018 Accomadation lives up to what u see on the pictures. Quiet and peaceful I would recommend a small car as it is off the beaten track but great if u want to get away from the madding crowds
17550859,Anna September 2018 A well-designed house  thoughtfully equipped and hosted by a very hospitable family. Location is perfect for direct access to a small beach away from the crowds  as well as nice places to eat within walking distance. We benefited a lot from helpful local advice  and a boat excursion with Giannis was a high point of the stay. A wonderful holiday overall for our group of diverse ages and interests.
17550859,Philip August 2018 Villa Cosambelli is a wonderful place to enjoy a holiday in Corfu. The villa itself is everything it says it is and more. The location is perfect if you're after a quiet holiday with a couple of tavernas within strolling distance. The beach is literally a 10 minute walk and is lovely and quiet with some loungers and umbrellas and motor boats which are fun to hire. There's a more buzzy resort about a 15 minute drive up the coast if you're in need of some excitement. Konstantina could not have been a better host. She met us on arrival  explained the villa and gave us some great ideas of what to do locally. She also invited us to the local village celebrations making us feel so welcome - she even got us doing the Greek dancing! Thank you!
17550859,Amanda August 2018 We booked without knowing much about the area. Turned out to be perfect for us. The village where the villa is located is quiet and right on the sea. Not at all touristy. There was a local Taverna that we loved. Our hosts gave us great information about the local beaches and activities and came to the house everyday to clean the pool and make sure we we having a good time. They were very responsive to all our emails before we arrived. There were so many things to do just a short drive away. The Villa was lovely. Clean and with plenty of space for us all. We didn’t want to leave. It was a perfect holiday.
17550859,Tomasz June 2018 Thank you Antonios . The house is situated perfectly  very close to Paramonas Beach . Everybody said that from the villa is one millon dollar view  beautiful sunsets and silence. Villa is very spacious  clean  well equipped with 4 big apartments with nice bathrooms. It is enough for 3 - 4 families because we have 2 big kitchens on each floor. At the end of the road ( 80 metres from villa by the sea is situated beautifull taverna PLORI. Food and atmosphere is perfect. Owners are very helpfull and very friendly. thank you for perfect cuisine. sea food was excelent. Taverna and villa are perfect connection for families who want to find silence and baeauty. In Paramonas you fell like in private beach faraway from crowded and overbooked holiday villages. George the villa owner is also very nice and helpfull. He cleaned a swimming pool every morning and we had nice conversation and he gave us a lot of good adivices. Thank you George!!. At the back of the house is small garden and lemontree and we were allowed to taste vegetables and fruits. Thank you George once again!!!! We highly recomend this villa to spend perfect holiday in Corfu.
17550859,Lisa June 2018 Very authentic Greek area of the island  accommodation was spacious  clean and modern with 4 luxurious en suit king size bedrooms and a large well equipped kitchen. The pool was very clean and not too ' chemically' . 3 nice Taverna close by  we especially liked Plori  were the food  prices and welcome was exceptional. Remember your mozzi repellent for the evenings. We found a hire car essential to explore and get bread from the local village every day. Nothing was too much trouble  the owner George brought us a new coffee machine and gas for the BBQ as soon as we asked for it. Can't wait to go back.
17550859,Avi October 2017 WE  a family of 8 members  had a wonderfull week at Antonio's place. the house is great  the privacy  the view  the small but almost private seashore and the service were excellent. The tavena plori nearby and rhe charming couple ho run the place: Aliko&Melani gave us a family feeling and good authentic food. we also love to cook and the kitchen was great. Dont forget your camera because the sunsets views from the house are astonishing ! We probably will come again
17550859,Steffany August 2017 I feel truly blessed to have experienced 7 days in this gorgeous villa. Despite my high expectations  it was definitely exceeded. (The pictures posted simply do not give the place justice!) From the jaw-dropping view  atmosphere and cleanliness... to the absolute impeccable service provided by Antonios  Konstantina and George (before  during and after our stay)! It’s the best place to go for a chillaxing break away from the buzz of the city with your loved-ones but still have the 5* standards… It was the perfect place to celebrate my 30th and now will forever be the place I got engaged! ;)
17550859,Isuru July 2017 I thoroughly recommend this villa! Set about 30m from the beach  it is a two storey villa with 2 bedrooms on each floor and a great swimming pool. The bedrooms are very big  each with an ensuite and dressing area. The villa is finished beautifully and is spotless.  Antonios and George (villa owner) are absolute gentleman and great hosts the pictures don't really do this place justice.  We had a great stay!
17550859,Yves September 2022 On the site the photos are magnificent  but unfortunately they no longer match reality  the gazebo is non-existing  the living area is the same  we found it in very poor condition behind the house with a lot of garbage. The house deserves renovation and outdoor maintenance Despite everything we had a lovely holiday and the house is very well located. Translated from French  Show original
17550859,Kerstin July 2019 The villa is beautifully and quietly located  elegant and modernly furnished  everything is bright and clean. From our point of view  the villa is comfortable for a maximum of eight guests  as the bedrooms are otherwise cramped  and the number of sun loungers and chairs at the dining table are also optimal. The villa is generously equipped  e.g. fly screens in front of most windows  air conditioning  blackout options  lighting  the kitchen equipment offers the most you need  there is a coffee maker for filter coffee and a Dolce Gusto machine (buy capsules yourself!)  as well as a kettle on each floor. The change of towels is twice a week  cleaning once a week. Washing machine and detergent are available  as well as two smaller stands to hang the laundry. Not provided are cosmetic products (small shower gel  small piece of soap in a small welcome box) and kleenex wipes. Dispose of the household waste is not clearly regulated. The gas grill with the covered barbecue area is great. A car makes sense  there are three small restaurants within walking distance  the nearest place with supermarket and ATMs is about 10 minutes away by car. Communication with the owner of the villa as well as the manager are great; they are always available and help in any necessary situation  give tips and are quickly on site in case of need.

13219734,Traian September 2022 We had an amazing 10 nights stay at the cottage. The property delivers all that’s expected: it’s charming and comfortable  somehow secluded (you need a car and decent driving skills) and very quiet. The garden is really nice  with an amazing playground for kids  fresh tomatoes  peppers  figs. Bill and his father really walk the extra mile to make everything comfortable; there were fresh fruits and water prepped for us and the following days they brought us home-made wine and olive oil and fresh eggs. One of the best AirBnb holidays we’ve ever had Response from Bill September 2022 Thank you for your kind words  it was a blast meeting you! hope we meet again!!
13219734,Angelica August 2022 The location is really great  in a calm environment inside a pinewood. We enjoyed the peace there. There’s really everything needed. The most important pro  by the way  is the host  Bill  who is really supportive and available during the stay. We really appreciated our time in Corfù and we’ll keep in mind this location for the future. Response from Bill August 2022 You were all great! Thanks for your kind words  hope we see you again!!
13219734,Ger August 2022 Bill was very nice..the house perfect and the views and garden absolutely beautiful. Good job Bill! Response from Bill August 2022 Thanks Ger! Hope we meet again!
13219734,Manuel August 2022 We spent 10 days at this house with three kids and this is just a perfect place for a familly. We had lots of space  wonderful view on the hills and forests of Corfu  a company of cats and rabbits  complete isolation  but just 5 mins car ride from a big road crossing the island from East to West. We recommend this house to anyone who wishes to spend some good time in calm and beautiful place. Response from Bill August 2022 It was a pleasure meeting you! Thanks again! hope we see you again!
13219734,Tanya July 2022 The house is spacious and located ideally to reach the beaches in every direction of the island or stroll around nearby Corfu Town. It has a big terrace with a beautiful view to enjoy after a day of exploring and away from the crowds of the busier areas. Bill and his father are exceptionally welcoming and generously shared vegetables from their garden  homemade wine and eggs from their chicken. The terrace is also lined with a wealth of herbs for cooking and we were lucky to also get some Bills's fathers homemade olive oil. We will definitely come again.
13219734,Frauke July 2022 We enjoyed our stay in Kompitsi. The location is very nice and pretty quiet and not far from Kerkyra. Bill was a great host and we loved the vegetables  eggs and wine we got from Bill's father. We appreciated the shutters which keep the light out of the bedrooms. The windows are equipped with fly screens. The animals (turtles  cats  rabbits and chicken) which live on the huge property are very cute. There are some nice beaches quite close by. A small car is necessary to explore the island. Response from Bill July 2022 Thanks for choosing our house for your vacation  it was really a pleasure meeting you ! Hope we see you again   take care !
13219734,Monika July 2019 We can only highly recommend this place. The villa is beautiful  comfortable and clean. Stavros is very kind  punctual and take care of guests at the highest level. The Stavros' hospitality is also at the highest level. The villa is surrounded by a big garden where You can meet cats  turtles and rabbits. In every window there is anti mosquito net. The place is quiet and cozy. Our family really do not forget the taste of cucumbers from Stavros' garden. This place is romantic but also great for families. It is exactly the place You need.
13219734,Elisabeth July 2019 This was a beautiful exclusive place to stay  fantastic views. Secluded in a pine forest we felt at home with the friendly cats (who don't come in the house). Stavros and his family were always available to help without being intrusive. All parts of the island are reasonably accessible provided you hire a car. All four of us as a family loved staying in the house and sitting outside in the evenings admiring the view.
13219734,Susan October 2018 A lovely comfortable house in an idyllic location. It's even better in real life than it looks in the photos! Very peaceful and relaxing  but with all modern amenities  we loved staying here! We had a hired car and found the cottage to be ideally placed for journeys out in every direction. Stavros was a marvellous host  met us at the airport and guided us to his place. He gave us lots of advice on places to go and places to see and messaged us several times throughout the week to see how we were doing and if there was anything we needed. Stavros was an exceptionally attentive host and this is a wonderful place to stay.
13219734,Thomas September 2018 We had 2 wonderful weeks in that beautiful house in Kompitsi. Stavros and his brother made a good job and it was a pleasure to meet them. A nice place to start a sightseeing tour through Corfu or go to one of the charming beaches of the island. The 2 bedrooms were perfect for me and my best friend as companion. And we loved the garden  the dog  the turtles and all of the cats!
13219734,Philipp August 2018 We spent an amazing time with our family in Corfu. Bill and Stavros property was the perfect base for exploring the Island - calm  plenty of space  fresh fruit from the garden  great view and after all the hospitality of Stavros and Bill and their family. Beeing back just a few days we already miss this place and hope to come back someday soon.
13219734,Ben August 2018 The pictures looked great and Stavros' very prompt replies to our queries gave us great hope for the holiday but it was even better. In August Corfu is hot  crowded in places and a little chaotic but at the house we saw no-one else for two weeks except for those watering the garden and providing us with an endless supply of vegetables and eggs. Response from Bill August 2018 Your family and you were great guests  we hope to see you again in the future. You are always welcome to our home!
13219734,Sorin July 2018 Totally recommended for those peoples thirsty for silence in a wonderful landscape painted with pines and mountain. Definitively  for us Kompitsi was a Heaven corner  in combination with the wonderful beaches  made happy our holiday in Corfu ! Response from Bill August 2018 Thank you very much ! you were ideal guests. Polite   kind and kept the house rules with respect. Thank you very much and we wish to see you again. Take care!
13219734,Petr July 2018 This gorgeous and fully appointed house has got everything  including a beautiful  secluded location  and great hosts who keep spoiling you with home-made and home-grown products  on top of regular house care. Our stay could not get better than this. Response from Bill July 2018 Thank you for you kind words  we wish we had time to get to know you and your family better. Best wishes from Bill & Stavros
13219734,Jane April 2018 It has been an amazing holiday at Stavros' and Bill's lovely cottage. Set in a wonderful scenery  among pine trees  it offered a relaxing and renovating accommodation  yet still close to the island's main attractions (beaches  monuments and main city). The cottage is very beautiful  clean and quiet. Bill has been an amazing host  making sure our stay was as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Totally recommended! Response from Bill April 2018 Thank you very much for your kind words. Was a pleasure for us too! Hope we see you again! Take care!
13219734,Sandra August 2017 Very nice and comfortable house. The air-conditioning in the bedrooms was highly appreciated considering the heat on the island in August. We enjoyed dining on the terrace with bbq and easy access to the kitchen. Stavros was a very nice and attentive host  we really appreciated all his attentions like providing delicious home-made food from his mother  letting us pick-up vegetables from the garden just outside the house  changing towels and bed sheets in the middle of our stay  emptying the rubbish bins so that we did not have to worry about that during our stay  driving us to the airport  etc. He also arranged for an additional bed for our 2 year old daughter in one of the bedrooms. These attentions made our stay at his place even better. A car is required to stay in this house as it is located in the middle of a pine forest on a hill. There is a small village nearby  but with the heat of August  we did not even try to get there by foot. The location in the center of the island is ideal to go and visit all parts of the island. We were driving around 30 minutes to very nice beaches (distance is not long but the streets are winding). There are many cats around the house which were coming to check if we would give them some food  which our 2 years old daughter enjoyed a lot. She also enjoyed looking at the turtles in the garden. However  she was afraid of the big dog staying there to safeguard the property. The dog is closed in a pen so it cannot get in contact with the guests  but it may bark quite loud. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at Stavros' place for a relaxing and comfortable holiday in the middle of nature. Thank you very much Stavros!

13219734,Ivan July 2017 The house is really clean  cozy and very comfortable. perfect for escape from a big city life. I was traveling with my wife and child 4 years old . we stayed there for 1 week. it was amazing holiday. the living room and the kitchen on ground flor provide enough space and coolness all day long. the terrace is a perfect place for family breakfast with a breathtaking view. the 8 cats on the terrace were waiting for my daughter every morning to feed them. she was so happy! the area around the house is very quiet and comfortable for walking around and meditation. the house is comfortably located in short distance from corfu town and pelekas. as i rented a car for the whole period it was very convenient to explore every part of the island. The Brothers (Stavros and Bill) are very helpful hosts. it was a pleasure to communicate. hope see them again one day! Response from Bill July 2017 Thank you Ivan  we were very happy to have you and your family in our Cottage! Hope we see you again  you are always welcome!
13219734,Susanne July 2017 We had a great time in our two weeks of holidays at the place of Stavros and Bill! The house looks as it is shown on the pictures. It is located in a forest close to a small village  there's no noise from cars etc. The view from the terrace into the landscape is beautiful and relaxing. Around the house is a big piece of land with a little garden with lots of vegetables. There was enough salad  courgette  eggplants  peppers to eat and cook everyday. The kids loved to pick the fruits! You definitely need a car to explore the island or to get to the next supermarket. But because of the position in the center of the island one can easily visit Corfu town or the beautiful beaches on the west coast.  Bill and Stavros are really kind hosts who gave us good advices about Corfu and helped us whenever possible. Response from Bill July 2017 Thank you very much for your kind words. Your whole family was great  we had a perfect communication and you took good care of the house during your stay. I totally recommend you as guests  hope we can have you back again some time!

13219734,Stepan August 2016 It has been an incredible experience. Located in the beautiful countryside near the best beaches to west and the Corfú town with Sissi's Palace to the east  this mansion gives you a real feel of the vacations that  once  nobles of those times were lucky to have. Stavros and his brother Bill passed every day to take care of the household  bringing some delicious food cooked by their mother. You also have a garden where you can collect vegetables for your healthy Greek salads Response from Bill August 2016 Thank you very much guys!

13219734,Anthony July 2016 Our holiday in Corfu  was the best short family holiday we have experienced; the island has plenty to offer  however much of this success was due to the caring attitude of our generous hosts Bill and Stavros and their parents at Kompitsi cottage. ‘You’ll appreciate the view in the morning’  said Bill  after guiding us by car from the airport to Kompitsi cottage  through the pine forest. A home cooked feast prepared by Bill and Stavros’s mother  plus breakfast provisions and more  was waiting for our midnight arrival. A new kitten Soosoo introduced herself and we knew from the first night that our stay at Kompitsi that it was going to be a memorable one. I woke early the next morning  and the view over the cool misty morning forest valley was breathtaking.  The Cottage  is more spacious than depicted in the photographs  the grounds are extensive  gated and private; all amenities are easy to use  the place is clean  tidy and well maintained. Kompitsi cottage is a great base from which to discover the island. An overwhelming plus for us was the plentiful  fully stocked organic vegetable  and herb and flower garden  we had the freshest and tastiest salads  and barbequed food.  The journey to the cottage  is via a steep winding road  passing through Kompitsi village  in the middle of the pine forest  it is totally off the beaten track  and therefore essential to hire a car. There are paths for short walks from the cottage  a farmers market 1km away  by car local shops  supermarkets  and petrol stations are 3-5 mins. The beaches Glyfada  and Kontogialos (NB. extremely steep ascent on return) are 15 -20 mins away  as is Corfu old town  the airport  and Aqualand. Some of the best panoramic views of the whole island are found at Kaiser’s throne near Pelekas  The Old Fortress and Achilleion Palace.  Kompitsi cottage is stand alone  up on a hill  therefore it is a place to take things to do  books to read and write  sewing  painting  whatever as there is no entertainment nearby. Kompitsi village is extremely quiet  and completely untouristy  there is one local friendly taverna  which does delicious traditional hot food and drinks. Concerning parking there is a relaxed attitude – however Corfu old town after 11am is difficult  better to visit either early am or late pm  parking is then available on the new or old port roads. A nice way to visit Corfu old town is to park on the Old Port road  (after 5) and walk the promenade into town  where everywhere is open until late.  Communication with Stavros and Bill was excellent. We would highly recommend staying at Kompitsi cottage  if you enjoy peace  cats! (lots of them)  fresh air  cooking  and a tranquil haven definitely far from the madding crowd. The only thing wrong with our holiday was that 8 days was just too short for us personally… we miss Bill  Stavros and Soosoo  and our time in Corfu.

You left the house in excellent condition and you were very caring and respecting about our property and its surroundings. We wish you the best! We cannot wait to have you back!

13219734,Christian September 2021 Beautiful cozy house with large terrace  in a quiet and wooded environment  with superb views of the surrounding countryside. Good location  close to Corfu  and in the center of the island for all visits. We had a great stay of 2 weeks with couples of friends. Translated from French  Show original
13219734,Igor September 2021 We were on this trip 3 times on the island of Corfu and if I ever come back I would definitely not rent another apartment like that of stavros. The house was beautiful the area and the garden around it idyllic. Our host picked us up from the port was always reliable and also at all times courteous and reachable. In the two weeks the house was completely cleaned twice and also the bed linen with the towels were changed. If you really want to relax  I would definitely recommend you to come here from the terrace you have a magnificent view and if you travel with children has plenty of space and also an entertainment factor in terms of the many animals that live in the garden  the cats have young this year. There are rabbits chickens even turtles and at least 10 freshly hatched were also in the enclosure. By car  you can reach the city super fast about 5 km away. In addition  there are many shopping facilities also a shop that was open on Sundays. Important for us as we arrived Saturday night and not too far was also a Lidl with many Greek variations of food. By and large  we are sure that Corfu is a beautiful place and the house we rented was the best decision we could have made. Translated from German  Show original Response from Bill September 2021 Thank you very much for your review  all your family were excellent as guests and respected the house. We will be very happy to have you again.
13219734,Marie August 2021 Stavros' house is great for discovering Corfu. Everything is done to make you feel good: from the vegetables you pick in the garden to the animals that live there. The house is very comfortable and the space and quiet allow to rest after a day of visiting. Stavros is very nice but also very professional. We highly recommend this rental. Translated from French  Show original
13219734,Pavlina August 2021 We stayed at Stavros' place already in 2019. Once again  a very relaxing stay with a great view  great connection to the beach and the city and with lots of peace and quiet on site. We just love it! We will be happy to come back. Stavros is a great landlord  he is very helpful  thank you very much! If you want to switch off from the hustle and bustle of everyday life  this is the place to be.

13219734,Maryline July 2020 Exceptional address: ideal location to visit Corfu  absolute calm  available surface area and amenities provided (air conditioning)  warm and personal welcome  faultless cleanliness  guaranteed charm (especially for families with children)... Address to be highly recommended... Translated from French  Show original
13219734,Pavlina August 2019 The property is as described in the pictures very authentically. Just a super nice place to relax and unwind. Still  it's not boring. There is a small area where eggplants  tomatoes  peppers and also plums can be picked and eaten. Every few days we got fresh eggs (from the chickens on the tinted piece of green) and tomatoes from Stravo's father. It is a huge terrain. There are still fenced off areas where there are still giant rabbits  geese  turtles. Watching her is very amusing! Of course  no cats are allowed in Greece. It's a great suburb. Very sweet and trustful! But not intrusive. We enjoyed the time very much. We stayed for 19 days. The proximity to the center  airport and beaches is very good. We would love to stay at Stavros on our next trip. He is a very accommodating and friendly host. Translated from German  Show original
13219734,Cristelle August 2018 Beautiful house surrounded by nature  very clean and well appointed  10 minutes from Corfu city center. Stravos is a great host  available  responsive and has good advice ! I would recommend this house to lovers of peace and quiet ! Translated from French  Show original
13219734,Oronzo September 2017 Stavros and his brother were very kind... they waited for us at the port. Upon our arrival  helping us with our luggage and taking us home... the same treatment we received when we left. The house is located in a strategic location 10 minutes from downtown by car and in an ideal location to go both north and south of the island. The house was very clean and we were delighted by the dessert offered by his mother before our departure. Excellent barbecue located in the garden where we could have a great barbecue with local meat... Very good!! The cats have kept us company throughout the vacation and are very polite as they never enter the house. There is also a dog but it is in the enclosure and not a problem... I would say a perfect vacation despite the somewhat rugged road to get home even if after a couple of days you get used to it... Thank you Stavros Thank you Bill!!

13219734,Primiano August 2016 We stayed in kompitsi for 12 days and had a great time. The house is beautiful  tidy and clean and super functional.

541236307370851600,Holger September 2022 Dimitra was the perfect host  always ready to support with anything needed. The apartment is fully equipped with everything including things for the beach  toys for the kids  umbrellas in case it rains… The apartment is literally on the beach so that the sound of the waves were bringing us down in no time. We really had a perfect holiday.
541236307370851600,Hazel September 2022 We highly recommend Dimitras apartment. Beautiful setting and a fabulous host. Dimitra could not do enough for us to make our stay enjoyable. Views were amazing and some lovely restaurants nearby. Thank you Dimitra for making our holiday so fabulous 💕
541236307370851600,Denise August 2022 From the warm welcome to the fantastic apartment Dimitra made our stay here memorable. The attention to detail shown in the apartment was amazing. Dimitra had thought of so many little things which made our stay perfect. I loved that Dimitra had painted the artwork in the apartment  she really cares about the apartment and how it is perceived by her guests. 10 out of 10 Dimitra  you are a fantastic host. We will be back Response from Dimitra August 2022 Your kind words really moved me! I thank you very much for that and for choosing to stay with us!!! I really hope we meet again in the future 😃
541236307370851600,Sophie July 2022 Dimitra is a wonderful host. She explained everything in the condo upon our arrival. Her communication was excellent- whenever we had a question about the area she responded right away. The apartment was emaculate. We would highly recommend!
541236307370851600,Lefteris April 2022 This Airbnb is heaven on earth! The house starts where the waves stop so even before you can think about it you are standing on the beach! The view of the whole beach every morning was dreamy! The house inside was brand new  fully equipped and very comfy and the hostess was just excellent! Best Airbnb experience!
541236307370851600,Stavroula April 2022 So much to say about our stay! Dimitra was a very kind and caring hostess. The house was super clean  brand new actually  and perfectly located on the beach front. Seriously takes less than a minute to get into the water. We were considering a house with a garden but this apartment left nothing to be desired. The balcony was a great choice because it offers a sense of privacy  perfect view and is honestly very spacious. In the past I've been promised a balcony with a view  but you could barely stand because of how narrow they were. Here we're talking about comfortably dining outside. Everything about our stay was ideal. The location is magical. Glyfada is wild and serene altogether. Waking up to the view was EVERYTHING! Pictures don't do it justice. This place is a must visit! One of our best airbnb experiences to date. We will definitely visit again. Response from Dimitra April 2022 We are so happy with your review!!! Thank you so much 😁
541236307370851600,George March 2022 The best beach house I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at! Gorgeous new apartment  and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk out on the balcony! High quality rooms  with huge TV and anatomic mattress! The best part..the fire place! Listening to the sound of the waves  enjoying THAT view and having a meal by the fire was the most amazing feeling! Many thanks to the hosts who made us feel like home! See you next year for sure!
541236307370851600,Karsten October 2022 There were two of us in the superbly equipped apartment of Dimitra for a week. The communication went well  Dimitra is an exceptionally accommodating  very friendly and attentive hostess. Superhost +++ The apartment was clean and equipped with everything needed for a perfect beach holiday. The highlight is the balcony with fantastic sea views. Just down the stairs and you are on the beautiful beach with crystal clear water. We have been able to enjoy our week to the fullest and give a clear recommendation for Dimitra's apartment. It costs a little more  but the location along with the full equipment in connection with Dimitra's service is certainly worth it. 5* Translated from German  Show original
541236307370851600,Anton August 2022 We highly recommend Dimitra's apartment in terms of amenities  cleanliness and extremely friendly helpfulness from the hostess - only not in summer  because we want to come back ourselves. Translated from German  Show original Response from Dimitra August 2022 Hahaha thank you and your beautiful family  you are always welcome back!!!
541236307370851600,Barbara July 2022 Perfect stay! The hostess thinks about every detail for the hosts' comfort. The apartment is very convenient  well decorated and on the beach. A restaurant just around the corner. Translated from French  Show original
20430498,Luke November 2022 Was an absolutely wonderful house to stay in with a very helpful owner that has a lot of knowledge of the area and is happy to help with anything he can  he brought us firewood for the nights and even delivered pizza for us when the store couldn’t. I’ll definitely be staying there again when I return
20430498,Christopher September 2022 The views and outside pool are great. The villa needs updating  bathrooms showers are low  toilet seats loose and broken. Cats shitting in pot plants around the pool while you are eating. Cats hanging around tables while you are eating. The road leading up to the villa is very steep and full of pot holes  dangerous driving. We paid nearly £2400 for 8 days and felt this price never justified what was wrong with the villa. Have rented other villas in Greece and by no means was this good value for money  very disappointing. When I contacted the owner about some form of compensation he said we were the last guest to be using it before they do upgrades. The condition was not mentioned in the Airbnb advertising of the villa. Would not go back even if they renovated it Response from Christos September 2022 I did not sccunb to the blackmail that you clearly did to me through your personal message.Your clearly asked me to return your money.Besides you were the one who assured me how great everything was.
20430498,John August 2022 We had a wonderful two weeks in this villa with spacious accommodation and amazing views. Our hosts  Spiros and Maria  went over and above to help us with lifts  gifts for the children and even cooking a Moussaka for us one evening. Highly recommended.
20430498,Marsha August 2022 A large spacious house with stunning views out to the sea. Lovely pool and close to airport and Kerkyra town. Spiros was very helpful in greeting us and guiding us to the house and responded quickly to any issues we had.
20430498,Uno July 2022 Wonderful place  great host!
20430498,Matthieu July 2022 Really smart and helpful
20430498,Carley July 2022 Fantastic views and great location. The pool area was amazing
20430498,Lucy June 2022 Spiros  Maria and son Christos were wonderful! Extremely accommodating and helpful. The house was beautiful with a beautiful view and great pool. We enjoyed our stay very much!!! Thank you to our Greek family!!! The Johnson family ❤️❤️❤️
20430498,Edmund June 2022 Once in a lifetime view. Beautiful pool and pool deck (with cumquat tree!) Very attentive host. Thank you.
20430498,Jessica June 2022 This was such a magical place to stay and the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had. It is hard to find the words to express how special it felt to stay here and the incredibly generous hospitality from Spiros. We are so grateful for the beautiful adventure and all of the help with our visit - couldn’t have been more fabulous!!!
20430498,Nicola June 2022 Great house. Pool and outdoor areas were excellent and the view was magnificent. Host was extremely helpful and welcoming. He met us at the airport  took us for a tour of the island and his wife even made us a lovely meal one night.
20430498,Joseph May 2022 Unbeatable views and everything you need
20430498,David May 2022 Very lovely and clean property. Hosts worked to accommodate our morning check-in after a flight cancellation and made us feel welcome.
20430498,Edward May 2022 fantastic villa with a truly incredible view. the owner is so helpful and really helped us make the most of our time. cannot recommend it enough.
20430498,Tim October 2021 Wonderful communication from Christos and a personal welcome from Spiros were perfect. The villa is spacious and has spectacular views across the strait to Albania. Functional  open and traditional the villa was everything we were looking for a week in Corfu. Just what we needed after being locked down in the UK to 20 months.
20430498,Toni October 2021 Very nice!
20430498,Aoife September 2021 We had a wonderful time at Spiros and Christos’ house. They were so accommodating and kind  nothing was too much trouble. Spiros (Christos’ dad) liaised with a travel company to give us options for expeditions and prices for all 14 of us. The house and the view exceeded our expectations and the pictures don’t do it justice. Thank you for a wonderful stay! We will miss you!!!
20430498,Lawrence August 2021 Spiros was a fantastic host! Very attentive  quick to respond  recommended some great spots and cooked us a excellent meal on one of the nights. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Casa T  could not recommend more!
20430498,Anna August 2021 We had a great vacation staying at the house! The hospitality of the host was incredible  Spiros and Christos picked us up from the airport  when we wanted to go to the beach Spiros took us there and he was always there to help us in anyway. The house is very big and spacious. It has great potential. The view was marvelous and we had great pleasure spending time outside durning the day and also at night. The pool was big and clean and helped us get through the high temperatures. One thing that we have expected more is for the house to be cleaner - but everyone has it's own standards. Spiros recommended us a great restaurant not far from the house with delicious food and wonderful staff. Spiros thank you very much for taking care of us! Response from Christos August 2021 Hello Anna .Thank you so much for your review. Be sure that we will examine in detail everything you describe to us and be sure that we will improve them at any cost.Thank you very much
20430498,Cristian July 2021 The worst experience ever ☹ Perhaps once a luxurious villa  very well located to provide a beautiful sea view  unfortunately now a wreak inside… It looks neglected  over and misused. Old and outdated furniture  smelly  greasy and rusty kitchen  almost emptied of dishes and cutlery. The tap was running and the kitchen sink… bleah! Almost fainted when I opened a few cupboards because of the rotting smell… The entire house was incredibly dirty  bad smelling and full of insects because of no insect screen at the windows. Unbelievable. We rented the villa for a week (6 nights). 6 bedrooms and 4 baths according to the presentation on AirBnB. We got 4 bedrooms and 3 baths  as the rest of the rooms were in the basement to which access was denied! Since we rented the whole villa  not only parts of it  we wanted to take a look and we were horrified. Damp  mold  sheets thrown away  dirt  dirt  dirt… like a dumped place. We could not believe this to be possible  especially now when everybody is so concerned about health  cleanliness and safety!!! Response from Christos August 2021 If everything you describe were true  the health authorities of the Island would not allow us to operate the accommodation. That alone is enough to make you understand that you are lying.After all  all the previous criticisms (and there are many) confirm that what you are saying are malicious lies that were intended to cover up your own energy.(as an Cristian Agency After all  all the previous criticisms (and there are many) confirm that what you are saying are malicious lies that were intended to cover up your own energy.)As an Cristian travel agency  you sold more expencive holidays) Show more
20430498,Alexandru July 2021 Tremendous views! The host was kind enough to show us around  gave us advices and showed us alot of cool places in Corfu! This really made our trip easier to manage! The place has everything you need  5/5 would come here again!
20430498,Sam June 2021 BEST AIRBNB AND AIRBNB HOST WE HAVE EVER HAD! the house was stunning with large rooms a beautiful swimming pool and amazing views. the Airbnb host was extremely helpful collecting us from the Port when we arrived  helping us bring shopping back from the supermarket as we did not have a car  spiros was very helpful and provided us with useful information about the island and gave us the best pesto we have ever tasted. if you are staying in Corfu I cannot recommend this airbnb more.
20430498,Aman November 2020 Hands down  the best airbnb I've stayed at and one of the most caring hosts. Amazing house  great location  attentive hosts. Thank you! I could not recommend more!
20430498,Ruth October 2020 The place was amazing  beautiful villa with even better views. Christos helped with everything and even let us stay longer to help as our flight was so late. Whatever we needed he did for us. 10/10. Thank you again.
20430498,Hannah August 2020 We can’t thank Spiros and Mari (Christos’ parents) enough for the hospitality shown to us during our trip. The villa is absolutely stunning but their warmth made our trip so much better - Spiros was always available to help us no matter what the issue was (booking taxis  driving to find us when we were lost) and even came over on a Friday evening to light the pizza oven for us! We really recommend coming to stay here - the pictures don’t do enough justice to how incredible the view is and how spacious the villa is. We would also definitely recommend renting a car as it makes it easier to get around the island.
20430498,Pash August 2020 Had an amazing getaway at this Villa with 7 friends from work. The hosts were incredibly kind and welcoming  and were always more than happy to help us (i.e when we needed to order food  get directions  order taxis etc).  The villa itself was even bigger than the photos. It was incredibly spacious and tidy  and in a peaceful spot. The pool was outstanding  and the views from the villa are remarkable.  Would highly recommend!
20430498,Callum August 2020 When we arrived at the villa we were all shocked at how big it was and the panoramic views out to the sea. Lovely hosts  Christos and his family were excellent. I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat!
20430498,Cynthia October 2019 An amazing villa with incredible views everywhere in the home. The most gracious family as your host and the island of Corfu is beautiful
20430498,Carlos September 2019 Great location and a spacious and well distributed house. View is truly spectacular. Hospitality was really superb and messages replied to very efficiently. Overall a great experience. Will definitely plan to go back with a larger party.
20430498,Arianwen September 2019 Good location for east coast and airport  fabulous view. Not an infinity as stated but lovely pool area. Comfortable loungers  lots of outside seating in sun and shade. Hosts very helpful.  Once a nice property but sadly photos are no longer representative.  A few things to note: * NOT AIR CONDITIONED There are wall hung units in the bedrooms that have passed their useful life. 3 blow air but do not chill. Host responded quickly to request for repair but they were sadly still not completed by the end of our 10 day stay. Freestanding fans in the lounge. Nothing in bathrooms  kitchen or other communal areas. * ‘3 showers’ are shower attachments with no wall fittings. There are no stand up showers in the property. * ‘hot tub/jacuzzi’ is a bath with jets that’s seen better days * Indoor pool empty and locked away. Would recommend you confirm availability in advance of booking. * Dish washer and fridge/freezer way past their useful life; fridge not cold enough to chill water. * Kitchen poorly equipped. Cooking meals at the house would be difficult. No coffee maker or toaster as specified in the listing. * Beds clean and comfortable and the bed linen and towels pristine  but the house itself is in serious need of a deep clean. * Internet connection intermittent and weak at best. * Ample bug repellant is provided for bedrooms and burners for outside areas but you’ll still need the strongest bug repellant on the market and lots of it!  Sadly would not say the quality of the property reflects the price charged. Show more Response from Christos September 2019 Thanks a lot for your review. But the indoor pool was neither included in the price nor in the pictures. So I can't find the reason to include it in your review.I hope you remember that the first air conditioner was repaired on the same day. The second air conditioner broke down on Friday.As you understund it was dificult for us to fix it because it was Weekend.On Monday we bought a new one.I would also like to remind you that since the air conditioner was damaged you could use one of the other three rooms.I believe that your comments were very strict.

20430498,Vemund Nordengen July 2019 The place and its location is great - it's just remote enough but also close to everything you want to see on Corfu. Christo and his father were super helpful with meeting us at the harbor  and helping us getting to the airport with all our luggage. The service and help they give is more than what I expected  and I would recommend to stay here very highly. Would visit again!
20430498,Dave July 2019 Amazing place. We were a family of 4 and booked the full place but we would like to return with our friends  2 other families as the stay would be even better socialising around the villa and pool.  Even though we had our own car  we were met at the airport by Spyros who kindly showed us the way to his home in the hills.  The villa itself is amazing. The most beautiful views and an amazing pool to chill out in and appreciate the countryside and local wildlife.  The hosts are courteous and considerate  pointing out all the best bits of the island and generally being wonderful people.  Looking forward to coming back.
20430498,Taryn June 2019 The pool and the views were incredible and Spiros and his family were so accommodating. Highly recommend.

20430498,Jeanie September 2018 We truly enjoyed our time in Corfu at this property. The views were amazing and there was plenty of space for everyone. I've stayed in countless Airbnb's and I can't speak enough of the host Spiros who was kindand and hospitable. He went out of his way to attend to our every need. When we found out that we couldn't drive because we didn't have international drivers license so he personally drove us around more than half of the island showing us wonderful things we would not have seen without him. He picked us up from the airport and give us rides back to the airport even though her flight was late. We highly recommend Spiros and his villa.
20430498,Angus September 2018 Beautiful space. Exceptionally friendly host who could not do enough for us. Really enjoyed our stay. He went out of his way to help us  even when we had left the flat by ferrying all our shopping to the yacht we had chartered. Too man and too family.
20430498,Ronit September 2018 A week in the villa in September  a family of four adults. Spacious villa  clean pool and warm reception at the airport. Thank you Spiros and Marie for the delicious breakfasts  and helpful tips for the beautiful places of beautiful Corfu. Breathtaking views at any hour. The location of the villa is great for exploring. No doubt we recommend the villa to make your vacation much more enjoyable
20430498,Aditi September 2018 The host met us at the airport which was unexpected and such a great surprise. They spent time wit us to show us where all local activities were located on a map. They had left basic essentials in the kitchen for us which was really helpful after a long flight. The coffee and the cheese sandwiches really saved us! The host also offered to have food delivered to us if we were too tired to go into town. Every bedroom in the apartment had an incredible view that was breathtaking. The stay was relaxing and the hosts were amazing  would highly recommend staying here. Response from Christos September 2018 Thank you so much for your good words.I really appreciate very much.
20430498,Taline September 2018 Incredible stay at the villa. We were 9 guests and we were very comfortable !! Christos’ parents were extremely hospitable. Picked us up from the airport  kept in touch with us daily to make sure we didn’t need anything  even made us a meal !! Outstanding experience on airbnb. We loved corfu very much :)
20430498,Phillip August 2018 Wonderful hosts  very spacious villa with beautiful views over Corfu & the sea view marina. Great value & lovely kind warm & friendly hosts. Juliet  london. August 2018.
20430498,Danielle August 2018 5 stars across the board. My friends and I stayed at Christos and his family’s place in Corfu arriving late at night (about 10pm) and to our surprise were treated to pick up from the airport. So unexpected and nice. When we arrived at the GORGEOUS house we did not want to leave the next day (to go on our sailing trip) the House was beautiful and we wished we could’ve stayed longer. Assuming we were tired from our long travels  the family ordered us delivery from their favorite local restaurant (as we do not speak Greek) and offered us wine. On top of that ahead of our departure the next morning  christos father made us a breakfast fit for Kings accompanied by his personally grown fruit and then was nice enough to come back just a few hours later to transport us to the marina. The family’s kindness was very much appreciated by my friends and I. Not only was the house and the city beautiful beyond words but the family running this air BnB was too.  5/5 recommend
20430498,Tom June 2018 A truly remarkable host and an awesome place  We were a family of 8 adults and the villa fit us amazingly  A great pool  kitchen  family room and just ample amount of sitting locations and gathering points  The best thing about the place is the view which is beautiful both in day and night  Lastly  our hosts were so gracious and caring  we were picked from the airport and were waited with the necessary items (water  fruits  cheese 😁)  I'm in love with Corfu and it's people  Enjoy   Tom Show more

20430498,İrem November 2017 Amazing house with the amazing hosts! The house is really big  has a breathtaking view and has the best location in the island. The House is located with the optimized distance to the best beaches. You can reach the best beaches which are on the west or eastcoast of the island in ca.15min. The house is also near to the city centre. Best thing about the house is it has every oppurtunities for every conditions. During the day we swam  in the evening we used the bbq outside and at night we had a beatiful bonfire. We were a young friend group of 6. Cristos's parents always helped us  we can't thank them enough. They took us from the airport at midnight and showed us the roads. Everyday they prepared the fireplace for us. Every day we have woken up to the most amazing breakfast. You should taste their lokmas and pancakes :) . They showed us the best places and best restaurants to visit and they were really beatiful. One night they cooked us delicious local dishes! They took us to the old town and told us about the historical background. We already missed our house in Corfu!
20430498,Jakub October 2017 Beautiful and large property offering exceptional views  delicious breakfasts  but first of all very helpful and friendly hosts offering outstanding hospitality made our stay at Casa T relaxing and enjoyable. We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Corfu island. Hope to be back soon! :-)
20430498,Nikolaos September 2017 Both our hosts (Spyros and Mary ) offered an unpresented level of kindness and hospitality. The estate had a magnificent view to the Island and the Marina as well . Very clean and well made  the house had a great exterior swimming pool and another one (indoor) under development ! Strongly recommend this property . Will defelently visit again !
20430498,Andrea September 2017 We had such a wonderful stay at this beautiful property! Christos and his father and mother  Spiros and Maria  are absolutely the best! From airport transfers  to fresh breakfast every morning  to the stunning views from the balconies and pool  we were so completely impressed by the property  but even more so by the hospitality of this family. We would highly recommend this home to anyone visiting Corfu. Our only mistake was not staying longer! Response from Christos September 2017 thank you a lot!! You are amazing people and it was our pleasure that you stay in casa T! We hope to see you again next year!!!

20430498,Αλεξινα September 2020 Outstanding hospitality Translated from Greek  Show original
20430498,Hanjo May 2019 The house is large and situated nicely. A little more attention to the details such as cleaning  replacing old dishwasher. It is necessary to make it a top location. Translated from Dutch  Show original
20430498,Gilles May 2018 I would recommend this villa which has a unique view and a central location for visiting the entire island of Corfu. The hosts are lovely. Translated from French  Show original
20430498,Sabine October 2017 Super views  great terrace with pool and a huge house! Mari and Spiros host with heart and soul. They help you wherever you go. Delicious breakfast every morning included (eggs  fruit  freshly squeezed juice  etc.) we were travelling with a 9-month-old baby and the two bought extra new baby utensils for this. In addition  we were picked up or taken from/to the airport. Translated from German  Show original
20430498,Heiko September 2017 Perfect place to stay  as described  over the rooftops of Gaios. Toler service  we were picked up at the airport  drove for dinner and also picked up again. Breakfast was a breeze! Absolutely top notch!! Translated from German  Show original

12194902,Luc October 2022 Wonderful quiet place. Totally recommended
12194902,Savannah September 2022 This beautiful home was such a treat to stay at. The views from the outdoor patio are incredible all times of day and the garden is lovely. The interior is also gorgeous  we love the way it is decorated with unique pieces and art. It is such a nice flowing space inside and we felt very at home there. Personally I loved the bathtub with the wide open window that looks out to the gorgeous view! The hosts of this home are very welcoming and kind  we felt like friends by the time we left. We would love to stay again in the future :)
12194902,Clare September 2022 We loved our stay in the cottage which was peaceful and charmingly decorated. A car is an essential to explore and obtain food. Having the two cottages together would be ideal for friends or family. We were just a couple and so only used the downstairs bedroom and not the two smaller upstairs.
12194902,Sioned August 2022 The view is quite something from this beautiful house  which has plenty of books  and the hosts were very generous.
12194902,Silvia July 2022 A place with a lot of charm  comfort  warmth  purity  character ... it is one hundred percent worth it! It is too obvious that Max puts all his heart in what he does! Will be back again!
12194902,Epco June 2022 Fantastic house! We had a great stay at Max his place. Spacious house  very nicely decorated with all modern equipment! Beautiful garden with a very nice view. Max went out of his way to deliver us a great experience  even brought toys for our kids and was available whenever we needed support. Also great to have a cot and a child seat.  Only comments: As there are no mosquito nets for the windows  whenever you open the windows  some grasshoppers and/or flying insects can enter the house. All the beds have mosquito nets  so no bites at night. No microwave (which we missed for heating baby food/ milk)  Other then that  highly recommended place in nice authentic village! Short drive (20 min ) to beach
12194902,Michalina May 2022 The best house and possibly the best vacation we have ever had. The garden invites you to a slow breakfasts celebration  the kitchen is equipped with everything you may need  the beds are comfy  and the views! It cannot be put into words. A week in this place was a real accelerated experience of the Greek way of living. Max is a great host and this home is a dream. We all feel we will come back to this place. I would recommend Max to everyone  he is an easy going person with lots of great island recommendations and always ready to help when needed. I recommend this experience 100%. P.s. Everything looks even better live than in the pictures😊
12194902,Stephane August 2021 Very nice house in a typical village ! Great host always available providing with the best locations to visit 😎
12194902,Dan July 2021 Beautiful cottage in a very peaceful location. The house was tastefully decorated and spotless. The patio area is great with views down to the sea. The village is very quiet  so a great place to relax! The hosts were very welcoming  and Max's tips where to go on the island were excellent. Highly recommended!
12194902,Artyom July 2021 great place in old  small village upper in the mountains not far away from beach. Beautiful to stay and relax.
12194902,Maren July 2021 The White Cottage was a perfect getaway for our family. We were looking for a peaceful place away from the tourist strip but still close enough to access the beautiful beaches. Maximilian was a very kind  gracious and helpful host throughout our stay. We’d recommend this place to anyone in search of serene views  starry skies and the more authentic side of Corfu.
12194902,Gabby September 2020 This is a completely gorgeous village house  beautifully restored and very peaceful. We loved being away from the tourist crowds and enjoyed exploring the mountain villages and their amazing old houses. Beautiful beaches are a short drive as are lots of places to eat. Hans and our neighbour had lots of good recommendations. Wish we could have stayed longer!!!
12194902,Philippe August 2019 Great place to stay when you visit Corfu. Old house recently renovated with taste - successfully mixing IKEA style and local furniture. Great views from the terrace. Good location to visit the Northern part of the island. Fully recommended.
12194902,Bronwyn June 2019 For anyone visiting White Jasmine Cottage you will not be disappointed  it’s been done to the highest speck and even has a jacuzzi bath which was an unexpected delight. The location is outstanding with beautiful views over the hills down to the sea . It’s within easy reach of all the main resorts and airport . We had a great time and will be going back
12194902,Richard May 2019 The villa is a beautiful retreat with stunning views and in a nice quiet location. It accommodated my family (two adults and three children under 5) wonderfully. I would recommend hiring a car/bike but it's location is close to a number of different beaches and to Corfu Town so picking up supplies isn't too difficult. Max was a wonderful host and provided so much information and help that we really felt like we were at home by the end of the stay and were very sad to leave - we could happily live their!
12194902,Rowena October 2018 You'll arrive to a calm  welcoming place. The cottage is secluded with beautiful views to the east and a gorgeous sun trap patio. The village has all you need and everyone is so friendly. The beaches at Arillas and Paleokastritsa are small but perfect and our favourite was Liapades. I can not recommend Corfu enough just out of season for the weather  the sea's warmth and the lack of crowds and busyness. Would love to come back and so would our 2 teenagers!
12194902,Angela October 2018 The cottage is in Ano Korakiana village which is a typical mountain village  away from the crowds while also located a short drive to Ipsos and its shops  beaches such as Barbati and Agni and an easy drive to Corfu town. There is a village parking area a short distance from the cottage.  The White Jasmine Cottage is a destination in itself  with beautiful views  charming rooms  a large well equipped kitchen and dining area  and a lovely outdoor space where kids can play. Max and Jiota gave us a very warm and informative welcome and took a lot of care to provide everything needed for an enjoyable stay. We would love to return one day!
12194902,Massimiliano July 2018 Very Good house
12194902,Cecile August 2017 The house was really comfortable and exactly like the pictures The décoration was beautiful and the view from the terrace is really amazing The village is pretty
12194902,Benjamin June 2017 We spent a wonderful family time Response from Maximilian July 2017 Ben   Margot   Yann & Mia  thank you for all  it was great pleasure to host you at our cottage. You will always be welcome here . Best wishes Jiota Show more
12194902,Janett July 2016 We had an absolute wonderful time at the beautiful little Jasmine cottage. The house is tastefully decorated with so much charm. Everything was just as peaceful and comfortable as you would expect in a holiday. We would love to stay at this house again! Hans  Thank you so much for everything!
12194902,Bertrand September 2022 Charming village house arranged with great taste  very quiet. Quality bedding. Beautiful outdoor. Easy parking. In short  everything you need for a pleasant stay. Please note  the slope to get to the house is steep (but short)! Translated from French  Show original
12194902,Bénédicte August 2022 Perfect stay to discover the beautiful island of Corfu.🇬🇷☀️😎 The house is absolutely perfect! It is beautifully decorated  well equipped and extremely clean. Great location too Maximilian's hospitality and availability are great!! 🌟🌟 Translated from French  Show original
12194902,Pauliina September 2021 The house is an absolute dream! You live directly in the village and still have your own peace and quiet  especially on the beautiful terrace with the garden. The pictures and the description correspond exactly to the reality  the bathrooms are freshly renovated and a highlight. Reception and communication were also very nice and accommodating. 10/10 Very happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original
12194902,Alessandra August 2020 The Cottage is a real gem  exactly as shown in the photos  cozy  very clean and with perfect spaces for a family or couples of friends. The outside is very nice  perfect for breakfast and dinner  absolute silence and lots of stars. it is essential to have a car and want to drive to the local tavern or the beach about 15 minutes away. The cottage gave us a chance to explore part of the island and get back home and enjoy the tranquility of fantastic summer evenings. Maximilian is very helpful and kind. Translated from Italian  Show original
12194902,Sabine August 2018 We had a wonderful week in Ano Korakiana. The house is very lovingly restored and as can be seen in the photos very tastefully decorated. Only on the large  sunny terrace would a parasol have been very pleasant on these hot August days. Translated from German  Show original
12194902,"Antoine August 2018 Very nice house with all the comforts carefully decorated and without unnecessary sophistication. Ideally located in a small village away from the crowds  we were able to travel around the island. Do not hesitate to ask the host for their recommendations of beaches  restaurants  tours and boat rentals (to be done absolutely to see the island of Corfu on the sea side). These are just places of great qualities and far from ""mass tourism."" The absence of a pool is not an inconvenience  on the contrary. The house is also ideally located for a morning run in the mountains overlooking it. Very nice route with a magnificent view of the bay. Translated from French  Show original"
12194902,Justus April 2018 First of all: the house is highly recommended. There were four of us (parents and adult sons) there in April. Corfu is great and especially easy to discover in the off-season  as there are few tourists on the otherwise quickly crowded island. The house is located in Ano Korakiana  an old village where there is practically no tourist. The village is located on a slope and so from the terrace you have a great view of the Corfu city bay  the sea and Ano Korakiana. In the village there are two or three very small shops  but already in Ipsos there is a larger supermarket (AB-market). Unfortunately  there is no restaurant in the village  but also in Ipsos (e.g. Moby Dick with good Greek cuisine). Parking is done with the rental car  which is almost necessary  in a central parking lot in the village and you then walk about two minutes to the house. The villagers are very friendly  as are Max and his family  who look after the house on site and speak German. It makes you feel like you've known each other for a long time. The old house was lovingly renovated two years ago and consists of a large modern kitchen (it really has everything  also dishwasher and washing machine) with dining table  a living room with fireplace and well-stocked bookshelf (+TV)  a large bedroom with master bed on the ground floor and two smaller twin rooms upstairs. Large closets! There are also two bathrooms with shower. Our only criticism here is actually our only criticism  as the bathrooms have not been completely renovated. Showering in the bathtub offers little comfort and there is no window or ventilation. However  everything is clean and towels are sufficiently provided. In the kitchen and in the two upper bedrooms there is an air conditioner with which you can also heat well. The fireplace also has a fan (instructions may be helpful here). The outdoor area has a large terrace with said view and two more shady spots behind the house. The garden with many plants and especially the adjacent wall remnants of old houses  which are covered with ivy  create a great atmosphere. A sphere grill is provided. We can recommend the house to anyone who does not want to stay in the direct hustle and bustle of tourist beach resorts. The ambiance of old house and modern is really successful.

The bathrooms are directly the closest project. Greetings to the family. Translated  Show original
12194902,Rosa August 2016 We had a wonderful time! The house is very pretty and lovingly equipped. From the large terrace you have a great view of the land and sea. The house is located in a quiet  nice mountain village. From there you can reach many fantastic beaches in 10 to 40 minutes. The hosts Jiota and Hans are very helpful and friendly. Thank you for everything  especially for the beautiful shared celebration! The only reminder: the dishwasher was broken for the entire three weeks. I'm sure we'll be back!

20595631,Nancy November 2022 What an amazing apartment! Newly renovated with high end finishes no detail goes unnoticed. The views are tremendous no matter what level  inside or on the balconies. All rooms are very spacious. Loved the quietness of village  steps from the beach  pier and restaurants. The location is a little remote but that’s what we enjoy  it had everything we needed. Andreas our host was amazing  totally hands on  with lots of info to guide us. Andreas even had supplied us with basic food to get us by for the day  so thoughtful and welcomed. Would definitely recommend this apartment  one of our favorites.
20595631,Kateryna October 2022 This villa is located in a small fishermen's village  so if you enjoy slow living far from crowds  this is a place to go. Andreas gives great tips on the island and the food in the nearby places is amazing
20595631,Rosie September 2022 Andreas' place is a perfect base for a family or group of friends. He has provided everything needed for a very comfortable and convenient stay. He was always available to sort out every detail of our stay  from organising transfers  boat trips etc. to providing clean towels and any other household needs. He was truly a 'super host'.
20595631,Kelly September 2022 Beautiful place to stay in Corfu  accommodation is great and the sea views so welcoming. Andreas is the perfect host. We would stay and go back in a heartbeat! lots to see and do close by  great food and nearby beaches.
20595631,Jill September 2022 We had a fabulous holiday on Corfu  Andreas is a brilliant host and couldn't be more helpful. We definitely recommend that you hire a car and explore this quiet part of Corfu with lots of lovely beaches within a short drive. We also had some amazing meals in the local restaurants where all the staff were incredibly friendly and the supermarket round the corner owned by Andreas's family had everything we needed. The apartment is enormous  clean and very comfortable and the views are amazing. We would definitely return.
20595631,Kelly September 2022 Thank you so much Andreas for sharing your beautiful home with us. We had the the most amazing two weeks in Petriti. The house is spacious  beautifully decorated and the cleanliness is first class. The views of the sea from all the rooms are breathtaking. Andreas was so helpful with organising airport transfers and car rental. He helped plan beaches and tavernas to visit and in his recommendations were perfect. Everyone in Petriti was so friendly and kind. I visited with my husband and 3 daughters who range from 12 to 22. There was something for everyone. I had such a relaxing holiday and hope to visit again one day. Thank you Andreas.
20595631,Marlene August 2022 Amazing host and apartment. Both were perfect and we have had a wonderful break. Andreas was a wonderful super host.
20595631,Caroline July 2022 Beautifully designed house  full of thoughtful touches. Amazing taverna opposite and a few lovely beaches in walking distance. Andreas was an excellent host and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend his place.
20595631,Candice July 2022 Well equipped and decorated house with a very kind host. Andreas is always willing to help  whether with tips or tours. Thank you!
20595631,Alex June 2022 First of all I have to say that Andreas may be the the best Airb'n'b host I've ever dealt with  such a friendly and helpful guy  he stayed out of the way but when we needed him he was instantly available and super-helpful.  The apartment is beautifully designed  with luxury materials  good quality fittings and numerous pleasing touches. The rooms and coridoors are really generously sized. It feels like a special place to spend time in.  The balcony gives you magnificent sea views and a nice feel of the bustle of the sea front tavernas whilst maintaining a sense of privacy.  We were bowled over by the many generous touches  like the stocked up fridge when we arrived which included much more than we could have ever expected.  Within 3 mins of the apartment you can reach the beach  a swimming pool  a cafe and your choice of top quality fish restaurants. What more could you want?

20595631,Ashleigh June 2022 I can’t recommend this air b n b enough.

20595631,Thilo June 2022 Best Airbnb ever! Andreas is a perfect host  and he and his brother provided us with lots of helpful info about the island and the area around his place. The apartment is really nice and comfortable and clearly has always been kept sparkling clean. Andreas even provided some groceries upon check-in  which was very helpful  when you arrive after a flight and the drive from the airport to Petriti. His family also owns a convenience store within taking distance that has everything you'll need for your stay. We also enjoyed the location. A good number of restaurants are nearby. Nice  sandy beaches are within a short driving distance (yes  I'd recommend having a rental car or scooter to get around). Also  the distance to the city of Corfu is definitely manageable and we took a number of trips to explore the city. We were only 2 and really enjoyed the spaciousness of the apartment  but of course this place would also be perfect for 4-6 people. The bedrooms are perfectly sized with comfortable beds and there are 2 beautiful large bathrooms. The living areas are fantastic with enough comfortable seating for everyone. We also like the large balconies with views of the small fishing port and beach. I can only highly recommend Andreas' Airbnb and I hope we'll be able to come back again some day.

20595631,Linda May 2022 Amazing host who gave us loads of wonderful suggestions and was very accommodating! Best holiday we have had in a long time. The location was great with a lot of restaurants either accessible by a walk or car. We do however recommend you to rent a car or two  depending on how many you are  so that you can really experience Corfu. The apartment was very clean and the area was quiet with restaurants nearby.

I wish you to have always safe travels and great adventures.
20595631,Helen October 2021 We have had a truly fabulous time staying at Andreas' property. The house itself is perfect  it is beautifully decorated and finished with the most amazing views of the sea. The village of Petriti is not at all touristy and has a very authentic feel to it with the fishing boats coming in every morning with their catches. Andreas and his family were so welcoming and Andreas could not do enough for us. He was always on hand to help us with any queries and gave us really good advice as to where to go. He helped us hire a car which I would advise doing as you can get to some amazing beaches on the other side plus the Olive Oil museum which is well worth a visit. We went on several walks from the property as well. The supermarket that Andreas' family own is extremely well stocked and it made eating at the property really easy especially with the fish that we bought from the boats. There are a few really good Taverna's in the village as well with great outside seating areas overlooking the port. We had an absolutely perfect holiday and felt very sad having to leave to come home. Thank you Andreas and your family for making it so. We will be back.
20595631,Assaf September 2021 If you are planning to stay in south of Corfu this place is really recommended. The host  Andreas  is amazing. Super friendly and helpful.

20595631,Nancy June 2021 Truly incredible!!! Andreas is a perfect host. The best I have ever experienced in years of staying at Airbnbs. His home is incredible! Every aspect of his home is perfect. It is sparkling clean and has amazing touches everywhere. There were 4 of us - we could not have been more comfortable. Beds were incredibly comfortable with such wonderful bedding. Views from every room are breath taking. Andreas was more than a host - he became a friend. He provided the best recommendations for restaurants and activities. Our holiday in Corfu was enhanced more than we could have ever imagined because of his assistance. We were fortunate to meet his family who run the grocery store walking distance from the Airbnb. Their grocery store has everything you need - including wine and a large selection of alcohol. Wonderful days and evenings in Corfu were topped of by a relaxing night on the beautiful patio that wraps around the Airbnb. The pictures are wonderful and do a great job representing this perfect Airbnb - however - it is even more amazing and comfortable than any picture. We will be returning to Andreas Airbnb - and HIGHLY recommend it. Would not even consider any other property on Corfu. Andreas Airbnb is perfect!!! We can’t thank Andreas enough for being such a perfect host and providing such an amazing home for us while we were in Corfu. Show more Response from Andreas July 2021 Dear Nancy  it was great having you and your beloved friends on Sopra IL Mare. When guests arriving on our property we want to make sure that they will feel safe and welcome. That's the reason why we point out all the must see places and the activities you should not miss while you are on the island of Corfu. Nobody knows better a place than the person who lives there. That's why Airbnb is a great idea  because people come together. Travel have changed the last years  tourists become travellers and they would like to try new things  they would like to be active  adventures and taste all the experiences that every destination offers. Those are they keys to understand this amazing world we live in. Thank you for choosing us and for taking care our property. You are always welcome here Show more
20595631,Ali October 2020 Andreas is an exceptionally helpful host. He took time to share great local tips on places to go and was always available to help with any requests.

Petriti is a delightful little fishing village and totally unspoilt by tourism - it is a great base for those wishing to explore the island of Corfu away from hotels and crowded beaches. Andreas gave us guidance on the best places to visit and we went to all .. and more. In all  a wonderful stay and we would definitely return.

20595631,Anne August 2020 What a great location  and such a beautiful  stylish apartment! We loved our stay here with a number of great restaurants near by  and a couple of small supermarkets a 5 min walk away. This is a working fishing village so there is plenty of delicious fresh fish in the tavernas. These are all directly on the sea front with their own small strip of beach to sunbath on. The water is sparkling  clean and warm with a gentle slope - perfect for young children  spotting fish and relaxing.  The apartment has a lovely balcony overlooking the sea  great for watching the sunrise and boats sailing by  plus an area for a BBQ. The apartment is really lovely and spacious  the only things missing for me was a dish washer and microwave. There are stairs up to the apartment so it's not suitable for those with access difficulties.  Andreas couldn't be more helpful  with excellent advice on where to eat and places to visit.

20595631,Sasha August 2020 A truly beautiful villa and remarkable host. The views truly are empowering and certainly resonated deeply. After a crazy LD in 2020 the villa boosts relaxation  serenity and truly rejuvenated me from within. The small resort has a strong greek traditional setting  with a lush taverna that serve outstanding food and service. The Host Andreas has a wealth of knowledge and connections and arranged trips during our stay; would highly reccomemd Georges speed boats! All of which Andeas negotiated discounted rates. A beautiful villa  host and outstanding villiage & family.

20595631,Gonzalo July 2020 We were very happy at Andreas’s flat!  The apartment was beautiful and well furnished with everything we needed  all the rooms were clean with a warm decoration. We found it pleasantly welcoming and comfortable.  Andreas also made us feel at home with his generosity and attentiveness: he always remained very kind and reliable  he gave us advice and recommandations and was willing to help at all times.  We gladly recommend this apartment for a peaceful and enjoyable stay in the south of the island.

All the best thoughts and vibes.
20595631,Kelly-Krette October 2019 Very nice place to spend your vacation in Corfu. A lot of space and very stylish. We really liked BBQ place outside  where you can spend warm evenings. Bedrooms are nice and bedsheets soft. Beach is close by and restaurants and shops as well. Petriti is not like a lot of other tourists towns  but that’s what we liked. Quiet and small town where you can see local life. Nothing is too far if you have a car or scooter.  We felt like this is our home where we want to come back every night.  Host is friendly  helpful and he respond fast. Good tips and recommedations! We really enjoyed our vacation and recommend others to stay there!

20595631,Maren September 2019 My business partner and I stayed at Andreas's Maisonette for a working holiday / strategy session and couldn't have picked a better spot. The house is absolutely lovely  well-designed with peaceful sea views from every room. The Taverna just in front is also fabulous and apart from the beach just outside  you can take a short walk to another charming beach. Andreas was super helpful  accessible for questions / concerns and very quick to respond. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend and would definitely consider a return trip!

20595631,Doron September 2019 We stayed 2 weeks at Andreas house. We had a fantastic time.

20595631,Vani August 2019 Staying at Andreas' place was outstanding. The rooms had a beautiful view of the sea and the rooms were stylish and spacious. In addition  the place was immaculate and the facilities and accessories were 5 star quality. Upon arrival and every morning we were greeted with a day trip planned and a map which he talked us through to ensure we got the most out of our stay. Meeting Andreas' family was also a pleasure they were very welcoming and helpful. The beach being less than a minute walk away was beautiful with bright and clear blue sea. Petriti and Corfu is a wonderful place  but Sopra Il Mare - the house  made our trip! The balcony and outside areas are beautiful and calming. After having discussed our passion for music we were greeted home with Andreas' brothers guitar which was a wonderful surprise and touch. The hospitality from this place is wonderful. We were left in awe about the place. Would definitely recommend! Response from Andreas August 2019 Dear Katia  Thank you for choosing our place for your summer vacation.

20595631,Dusan August 2019 I don't usualy write good reviews since i don't want to spoil someones expactations  but Jesus this experience at Andreas Sopra il Mare is something outstanding in terms of everything and fully deserves recomendaton on any level. Modern high end & stylish accomodation with 3 bedrooms  2 bathrooms and fully equiped kitchen like a dream house you want one day to own with terace 30meteres from the sea like a top on a cherry and bbq garden in the back. Petriti might not have the perfect beach but small fishermans village offers you the best taverna in Corfu - Limnopoula. Closest perfect sandy beaches are just 15 minutes drive away so it is realy not a drag. And Andreas  the host and his family  let's just say you are having not a host but a friend maybe even an brother there. Hospitality is his/theirs DNA  he simply couldn't do much more for us  so i really hope that sharing this honest recomendadtion for his next guests is just one small way of saying thanks for everything bro. Will meet again for sure very soon. Response from Andreas August 2019 My Dear Friend Dusan  thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure to host you  Martin and your families at our property. We are grateful for your visit and we hope that you will come back in the future. Always safe travels and great adventures! Show more
20595631,Attila July 2019 It was such a great holiday! Andreas and his family was very kind  always there if we needed something. The apartment was gorgeous. Everything was put together carefully  little details were considered. It was really like being at home or even better :) Great hospitality  very welcoming atmosphere. Beach was very close and nice for families with children. Great private place to grill  beautiful lemon trees in the garden. Fresh fish available at the port 3 minutes walking distance. Very calm and nice village  and great taverna in front of the apartment. Hopefully everybody will handle carefully the house so that it remains like now. Thanks for Andreas and his family for everything! We hope that we can come back next year as well:) Response from Andreas July 2019 Thank you for choosing our place for your summer vacation.

20595631,Polina June 2019 I suppose it is the first time I leave a comment for a place I have visited  as I can truly say that this was really the most wonderful place I have visited. First of all  I did not feel like a guest  I felt like home. We travelled with my family and friends and this appartment suited greatly my small kid of 1 year and 3 months (our host made it as safe as possible  as well as comforted us with a children bed and a baby monitor upon our request) as well as adults - everybody found their own way to relax and have fun time. The appartment looks amazaing  it has two floors with a big studio with an well equiped kitchen on the the first floor and three comfy bedrooms on the second one. There is a lot of space for everyone  you may even get lost :). The balcony is worth a separate mentioning as passing time there might be regarded as some sort of meditation - as the sea is just a few steps away from you. On the ground floor we passed amazing evenings near the grill area with some barbeque  music and drinks. The best part is that the sea and the beach are really just a few steps away  meaning less than 1 minute from the appartment's entrance. The village where the appartment is located is quiet with not so many tourists and really beautiful places around. To some of them we travelled by walk  for others we rented the car. We also enjoyed the old town with beautiful orthodox churches and houses in Italian and French styles. But anyway one of the key feautures for us was the warmth and kindness our host Andreas welcomed us  he did his best and I suppose could not had done more to make our stay like home!

20595631,Matthias August 2019 In August 2019 (48/49) we spent a wonderful week in 'Sopra IL Mare' with our three daughters (9/13/16). We never had such a tasteful and clean Airbnb before  with such nice landlords! The view of the Ionian Sea is fantastic. Andreas and his family were always there for us; communication in English was easy and straightforward. For reception  the fridge was already stocked with delicious  local products. Within walking distance you can reach a small supermarket run by the landlord's family; the shop is open almost 24/7 in the high season and offers everything in very good quality for basic services. A few steps from the front door is the beach of Petriti and a good (fish)tavern. It's only about a 10-minute walk to 'Notos Beach' - our whole family was delighted by this dream beach! We rented a car to explore the island; in the neighborhood there are two small car rentals. We were surprised at how green the island was in late summer. We spent our second vacation week on a sailboat that we took over in 'Marina Gouvia'; Petriti is also a good starting point for this combination. Land & People and the Greek hospitality have taken us by storm. - We will definitely come back!

20595631,Katia August 2019 Andreas's home is wonderful. And it was wonderful to get there in the evening to discover it in front of the sea  as we did not expect. Our boys and girls were thrilled. The large rooms with windows overlooking the sea  boats and plants entered and ran through the rooms on the first and second floors. So close that it seemed to touch them. The photos do not make the beauty of the house  the light  the atmosphere  the curve of the details. Petriti is a spell  ten seconds from the garden gate to the pier  the restaurant downstairs is one of the best in the area for fish and shellfish  the specialties of the place  a small fishing port. Sand and water are transparent  we might not have moved but with five kids (not so little) it would have been impossible. Andreas also took care of this. He had left us some slides in the kitchen with beaches and places to see in Corfu and a map with secrets written in pen that he was happy to explain to us every morning. He was always available to resolve every request and requirement. Corfu is large and has lots of things to do  but the thing that we liked most about the whole vacation  was going home. Every evening.  Andreas' place is wonderful. And it was wonderful to arrive at night to discover it by the sea  as we expected. The kids were excited. They entered and took classes through all the rooms on the first and second floors  the large rooms  with windows overlooking the sea  the boats  the plants. So close that they felt like they were touching them. The photos on the site do not show the beauty of the house  the light  the atmosphere  the curve of the details.

20595631,Bettina July 2019 Andreas is a Superhost for us  a great  committed host who gave us a great stay in Corfu. For example  he offered to pick us up from the airport and organize leisure activities (like a tour by motorboat) for us. During our stay  he was always available to help us with lots of tips and insider information. Communication with him (in English) was easy and uncomplicated. On our day of arrival  our daughter had a birthday and Andreas had decorated the apartment wonderfully: with huge balloons and everything a girl's heart beats. Our daughter loved it Andrea's apartment is great layout  extends over two floors and is modern and stylishly furnished. We felt like we were in a design hotel. Our kids loved the big comfy sofa and the XL TV. We enjoyed the evenings on the terrace and the fantastic view of the. Another beautifully designed outdoor seating area in the garden invited you to barbecue. We lacked nothing in the house  every detail was harmonious  practical and there to give us a pleasant stay: From the deliciously stocked fridge with local products to the available charging cables for our mobile phones to the towels: the blue ones for the beach and the white ones for the two bathrooms. On foot we were on the (pebble) beach after a few meters. Right on the water was a very nice tavern  where we liked to eat in the evening (it is always recommended to have some bug spray with us at sunset). There were no problems with insects in the apartment as all the rooms were equipped with insect screens and air conditioners. After our stay with Andreas  we spent a few more days in the north of the island. In retrospect  however  we found that we enjoyed the south much better. The beaches were less crowded  there was less tourism  and people in the south were much more relaxed. The Greek hospitality has absolutely impressed us here.

35102096,Stuart September 2022 My wife  mother in law and I have just returned from this amazing villa. We had previously read all of the reviews and thought the experience might not live up to the 5 stars it has been awarded awarded. It didn't..... our experience exceeded this rating. Every positive comment made in the reviews are 100% accurate. Alex and Hara genuinely wanted us to have a great holiday. Communication between them and us was excellent and greatly appreciated. We took our paddleboards with us and went out as and when the sea and wind were most favourable - which was most days. (No guarantees in mid to late September). The beach and sea were ideal to paddle on. The sea is calm compared to the west coast of Corfu which is only a 15 minute drive away. Gardenos beach  on the west coast  has two great tavernas... we highly recommend them. They are literally on the left and right hand side of the beach. Not much else is there  so you'll not miss them. Taverna Aristos on the beach at Perivoli is also amazing. There is shallow water there enclosed by a very small and simple harbour. 5 minutes from there is the Savvas Taverna  where the views are truly outstanding. Alex kindly took me out on his boat hand line fishing for Dorado (mahi mahi)  it was an amazing experience! I cooked a 1.5 kg fish on the bbq - fantastic! We also bought 1 kg of fresh prawns one morning from a local fisherman who was taking the fish and prawns out of his net  again... you can't get better than that if you eat prawns. We cannot speak any more highly regarding Alex  Hara and their amazing villa. If you want hustle and bustle or to watch hoards of people then this is definitely not the place for you. Tranquility and serenity are in abundance at this superb holiday escape. Show more
35102096,Paul&Georgiana September 2022 We rented the house for 8 days and barely wanted to go anywhere else. This is due to the fact that you have there everything you need  sandy beach  taverna  terrace  bbq place  AC. The owner waited us with pleanty of water and groceries   so you do not need to immediately go to the store. I would rate this as 5+star as this accomodation changed my perspective of future holidays in Greece.
35102096,Mihai September 2022 We spent two weeks in Hara's and Alexadros place and we enjoyed every moment of it. The house in reality is just as presented in the pictures and has everything you need. It is a perfect house for spending quite time with the children playing in the water (which is very shallow for almost 100 meters and very warm  at least in the second part of August when we were there). The location is very quite and not very tourist-lead (basically a small village and port where mostly the locals are coming to enjoy the beach there  with just a few other beach houses to rent up and down the shore). There is a good beach tavern just 2 minutes walk and plenty of other taverna options and supermarkets at a 10-20 minutes drive distance. Finally  we need to mention the hosts  who are a very nice and friendly couple. They really took their time to make sure we will have a wonderful vacation: very responsive in our pre-arriving conversations  they prepared a wonderful welcome basket when we arrived and they were constantly checking on us to make sure we have all we need (without being intrusive or anything like that). All in all  it was a very enjoyable experience and we look forward to come back here.
35102096,Keith August 2022 Great place to stay  loved the village and the sea - having a car was even better as could pretty much go anywhere. Really useful having a food parcel as flights arriving were delayed. Managed to get to the house at 3am after delays and Alex & Joy were very helpful and accommodating!
35102096,Jon August 2022 Wonderful place  great communication from the hosts from the beginning through to the end. Everything was easy. Sea right out front with red sky sunsets  sea waist height for 100m so our 3 year old could play in the sea no worries. Everything you could need from the place from parasols to deck chairs. Alex took us to the family vineyard and showed us around  throughout was a star checking everything was good for us. Really can’t say enough good things  would come back in a heartbeat
35102096,Ollie July 2022 Beautiful villa  stunning location  seconds to the beach and bar. The host was very helpful  we had an amazing time but would recommend a car as the shops are a little to far to walk comfortably. Would highly recommend and would definitely go again.
35102096,Annemarieke July 2022 We had the most wonderful time at Panos beach house. Alex and Hara are excellent hosts and did everything to make us feel at home. Hara prepared a very generous welcome basket and Alex took us on a tour in his vineyard  about a 10 minutes drive from the house. It was very interesting and the wine he makes is really good. The house was very comfortable  right next to the sandy beach with shallow and warm waters. We liked Petrakis beach tavern too  a 50 meters walk away. We highly recommend this place and hope to be back again.
35102096,Anne Marie July 2022 We had a wonderful stay in this lovely house. There are stunning views across the bay to Corfu town and the mainland and we saw some beautiful sunsets. Alex and Hara are very hospitable and welcoming and the generous welcome pack was much appreciated  especially as we arrived on a Sunday when large supermarkets are shut. Alex and Hara checked regularly that everything was okay. We had no issues at all but we are confident they would have done everything to put things right  if there had been a problem. The house is well equipped and comfortable with direct access to the beach. The beach is ideal for families  as the water remains shallow for a long way out. The location is very peaceful but there is a good taverna just a few minutes walk along the beach. You also have a range of other beaches within a short drive  if you feel like a change. We recommend highly and hope to return!
35102096,Vaida June 2022 There was amazing week in Alex and Haras home. They are very helpfull and caring hosts. This place is perfect with kids  the beach is in front of the house and its perfect with kids. At home you can find everything you need: beach towells  umbrellas   big terrace  well equiped kitchen  air conditioning in every room. Also is very clean. Alex was very friendly  he taked as to excursion to his vyneard. Recommend this place!!!! We love it!!!
35102096,Stefan June 2022 Great place  we loved it. Not much else to say If its party youre lokking fore  keep looking.
35102096,Tobias June 2022 If you're looking for an awesome place right next to the beach  lots of space (we were 5 and had room to spare)  super friendly and helpful hosts  good food next door and lots more look no further. The beach is also perfect for kids as the water stays shallow for a long time. Can highly recommend and will for sure be back.
35102096,Cindy April 2022 Definitely one of the nicest places we've ever had the opportunity to stay. The space was welcome and inviting  comfortable and clean. We needed a place to recharge our batteries and found it here. Everything needed in the kitchen  a comfortable bed and super fast internet. One couldn't ask for more. Our host/hostess were there for any questions  they provided us with a welcome basket full of supplies   and offered advice on shopping and how to buy fish from the local fishermen. The pictures don't lie  the beach is literally 3 steps off the sidewalk. Can't recommend them highly enough.
35102096,Marlon October 2021 Best airbnb!! We stayed for a month in Alex and Hara's beautiful house in Lefkimi right next to the beach. The house is wonderful  super clean  it has everything you need and more. Alex and Hara are the best hosts we have ever had on airbnb and we have been to quite a few :) They asked us frequently if we needed anything and if everything was ok. It was our first vacation with our baby (8 months old). The house is very good for families. It has a crib  a highchair  toys and much more. We asked for a baby bath and they bought one extra for us. The kitchen is great and with all amenities. The fridge is huge and fits all the greek deliciousness inside. You can get fresh fish from the small port  which is 5 minutes to walk there. The taverna on the beach is also great and it is open the whole day. The bedrooms are very cosy and the mattresses were super comfortable. All the windows in the house have mosquito nets. Heating is available in the whole house as well as air conditioning in the bedrooms. Highly recommended!!! :)
35102096,Samuel September 2021 Amazing! This summarizes well our stay in Hara and Alex’s house. The place is very well suitable for small children with a lot of space and one step close to the beach. This beach is low without any waves. Our 2 5 years old daughter loved walking into the see. The hostility of Hara and Alex is memorable. We enjoyed a lot the Sunday morning collecting grapes with them. Thank you very to both of you.
35102096,Iuliana August 2021 Alex’ s house was wonderful! Everything was perfect. The house is located right on the beach  it has big sleeping rooms  very well equipped kitchen  all very clean. The beach was very nice  with swallow water  ideal for children  and above all very quiet. We really appreciated the welcome gift ( fresh fruits  something to eat  and the house wine). Alex was very helpful and extremely friendly and welcoming! I hope to come back here again!
35102096,Claudia Aidee July 2021 Amazing! First of all the best location  you can’t get a better one. Big front garden and then you have the beach. We went with our kids and had an amazing time  the beach is just perfect for kids as it is sandy and it is not deep. They also have beach toys  sun beds and umbrellas so you are all covered! The house is just lovely and you have everything you need. The kitchen is super complete  everything you might need is there so that was convenient. You have a washing machine and there is air conditioner in the 2 rooms. You have a restaurant just walking distance and 3 super market options close by but for that you need a car. Hara and Alex were the best ! Amazing communication  hospitality  just great people  we will love to go back! Also a lovely gesture is they leave some fruit  juice  water and snacks for you when you arrive and that is just lovely. I really recommend this place!
35102096,Bernadette October 2020 Alex house is beautifully situated directly on the beach in the quieter south part of the island. The beach is sandy  the waves shallow and you can walk ages into the waves with still being able to stand! It’s the perfect location with children! The house is fully equipped with everything you need including a big basket of goods Alex‘s wife bought for us and several additional gifts including a self made wonderful white wine from Alex! The WiFi may be a bit slow but that didn’t bother us as we did have time. The only thing that might be missing for some is a dishwasher but as I said - we weren’t in any hurry so it didn’t bother us either. We loved taking breakfast on the terrace with views of the ocean and sleeping to the sound of the waves! Alex and his wife even provided sand toys for our child! Several supermarkets are only a short drive away and only 100 meter down the beach in front of the house is a tavern that offers breakfast/lunch/dinner from 9am right into the night! The food and service are great there! In the area you need a car to go around and also reach the house. I highly recommend this holiday home - we’ve loved staying there and can only send a big thank you to Alex and Joy! We’ll be back!
35102096,Maicon September 2020 Fantastic! I highly recommend Alex's place. We stayed for 2 weeks and had an amazing time. We enjoyed the quietness of the place as well as the well-equipped house. The house has literally everything you need - all amenities. Our 2-year-old baby had a great cot and a super cute pillow. It is a fabulous place for families. The sea is just 30 steps from the house. Both Hara and Alex are fantastic people and were there for us. I highly recommend the place. Will come back again and recommend to all my friends.
35102096,Thomas September 2019 Alex and his brother are really wonderful  very friendly hosts. The check-in was without problems  we could immediately in the house. The house is beautiful and lovingly decorated  everything is new and nothing is missing - okay  maybe a dishwasher ;) The house is located directly on the long sandy beach  the water is always nice and warm as it is also very shallow (it is ideal for small children). Alex was always available to help and advice  he has every day with us  if everything is OK. As a farewell gift  there was even a bottle of homemade wine which we liked very much. Since the place is a bit out of the way  we recommend a rental car. Thus  one remains flexible and can do the necessary purchases to the nearest supermarkets (5 minutes drive) quickly and easily. From us a very clear recommendation for those who like it quiet and relaxed. If we are back on Corfu  we will certainly come back again.
35102096,Georgios February 2022 Beautiful house right on the quiet beach. Delightful indoor and outdoor spaces  modern decor  amazing terraces overlooking the infinite blue of the Ionian Sea. Ideal for quiet getaways  but also for multi-day family vacations. Wonderful and very friendly hosts. We highly recommend! Translated from Greek  Show original
35102096,Xavier August 2021 Very nice house by the beach. The house is very clean  very well equipped. The area is quiet  the sea is beautiful. Very good welcome with a large topped basket. We also had a bottle of wine from the owner's production who was kind enough to show us around his vineyard. The area is not next to the main tourist sites  but it makes it very pleasant on the contrary. Private beach limit. Nice little restaurant at the end of the beach. We recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
35102096,Arnaud August 2021 Very well located house that really overlooks the beach  close to a restaurant with magnificent views of Corfu Bay - the beach is perfect for small children because the water is shallow and very hot in the afternoon The house is spacious and very clean. This is not a rental house but really a secondary residence of Alex and Hara  so you will find everything you need for the stay Alex and Hara are extremely welcoming and remain available if needed. We really had a dream stay and hope to come back another time. Translated from French  Show original
35102096,Viktoria July 2021 We had a lovely time at Alexandros and Hara's place. The house is a semi-detached house in a series of beach houses where the Greeks mainly vacation. It is well equipped and tastefully decorated. The sea is right outside the garden door. However  the water was very warm in July (about 28 degrees  my husband says) and actually no more cooling. We were able to park the car on the property. Alexandros makes wine of his own and guided us through his vineyard. The cats were nice too. Translated from German  Show original
35102096,Beata July 2021 Beautiful place with everything you need to do your best work. The home is well equipped  clean  and right on the sea. The view from your patio and windows is amazing. The beach is not crowded and the depth of the sea is ideal for direct relaxation with kids. There are lots of shops and restaurants within a few kilometers  but you'll need a car to get there. Hosts are so welcoming and helpful. Over the course of their stay  they made sure we had everything we needed. It's definitely a place he wants to come back to  and we hope to have it back soon.  A beautiful and perfect place in many respects. The house is perfectly equipped  clean and right by the sea. The view from the terrace and windows is amazing. The beach is not crowded and the depth of the sea is perfect for a direct vacation with children. There are quite a few shops and restaurants within a few kilometers  but access by car is necessary. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. Throughout the stay  they made sure that we did not miss anything. It is definitely a place where you want to come back and we hope to come back soon.

35102096,Nikita October 2019 We loved it. A very nice house  equipped with everything you need. Fantastic view. They wake up to the view of the sea and the sound of the sea in their ear. There are two bathrooms  which is great for several people. The terrace leaves nothing to be desired. Netflix and good internet connection will bring the rest of the world a little closer. The beach is reserved for you alone. The sea was very clean (we discovered many species of fish  annemones and starfish)  very shallow on a longer stretch  and wonderfully sandy  in 30 meters there is a small tavern on the beach. It is a house for quiet holidays  away from big holiday trips. A car is necessary. Translated from German  Show original
35102096,Marie France September 2019 Alexandros' house is very well located in a very quiet place  by the water The house is very well equipped  impeccable  very welcoming and very clean. The hosts are very attentive  very responsive and discreet. We highly recommend it. Translated from French  Show original
35102096,Catherine July 2019 Great welcome. The house is very comfortable. It has an ideal location by the sea and the views are stunning. Alex is always ready to do a favor. A car is essential. Translated from French  Show original
33991377,Sven October 2022 A fantastic stay. The Description of the Villa fits on every point described. A pure Villa for relaxation right in the middle of the Nature! A very clean and modern Place. Holidays in the LoS is highly recommended by us. We would come back without any question! Thank you  Kristos!
33991377,"Michael August 2022 Christos and his family are wonderful hosts. ""The Land of Sirius"" is a charming villa. With a cosy interior and a large open outdoor area with an awesome deep pool. Hilltop location made for incredible view of the sea and mountains during the day  night time is full of countless stars. Chalikounas area is very quiet place with a number of stunning beaches near by. I highly recommend having a car so you can see as much of the beauty Corfu does offer."
33991377,Sylvie August 2022 Lovely house and a lovely pool  perfect host and perfect Holiday  thank you for everything!
33991377,Quy August 2022 This is the best place to go for an unforgettable summer vacation in Corfu !
33991377,Andrew July 2022 Charming villa in a very quiet area. Well equipped outdoor area with plenty of seats and a lovely pool. There are 2 good local restaurants only a short walk away with some decent vegetarian options. The beach is only a 5 minute drive as well. A car is essential as Corfu town is 45 minutes drive away.
33991377,Susan June 2022 The Land of Sirius is a wonderful place to stay and have a relaxing break. It is even more breathtaking on arrival than you would imagine from the pictures. Christos and Vasilis are most welcoming hosts and very accommodating with arrival and departure times. The house is beautifully cool  spacious and comfortable. There are 2 upstairs balconies  giving wonderful views over the bay. The kitchen is very well equipped for preparing meals and there is a shared BBQ area outside with table and seating. Also in the kitchen is a small dishwasher and washing machine.The water is drinkable  saving bulk buying of bottled water. The outside area is just stunning. A beautiful pool with natural filtration and a system of water renewal to remove insects and bugs. Plenty of sun loungers and seating and a hammock.The surrounding garden area is beautifully planted and there is usually a cool breeze from the sea. The house is very private and secure  on a hilltop and with views of the bay. There are 2 tavernas locally about a 15 minute walk away and the local beach is about a 5 minute drive. It is fairly quiet and beautifully sandy. There is a beach cafe there. We enjoyed our stay and I would not hesitate to recommend the Land of Sirius if you want a peaceful and relaxing holiday.

33991377,Christian June 2022 We stayed with our 6 years old daugther 11 days. We had a fantastic time and would book the house again!  The absolute highlight is the pool: 1m at one end with stairs and a bank to sit on and 1 6m at the other end. It was the whole time totally clear and the water neither smells like chlor nor burns in the eyes because of the salt electrolysis cleaning. Beside the pool is a great barbeque area - even with a small fridge.  The house is well equipped. The WLAN is not fast but is was fast enough to stream videos. The view from the roof terrace to the ocean and mountains is wonderful. In the area live a lot of animals - we saw a hedgehog  giant green lizards  a sand boa (harmless)  beautiful butterflies… The long sandy beach that slowly gets deeper is ideal for children. If you look for a great (but more expensive) restaurant we recommend the Archontiko (15 minutes drive).
33991377,Martin May 2022 Villa and location are superb  the hilltop location meant that we had a nice breeze whereas it was much hotter down nearer the beach. Landscaping and planting of the garden is also great. Villa is very comfortable and excellent double glazing ensures that it stays cool during the day  although it was upper 20’s during the day we didn’t need to use the aircon at all.
33991377,David May 2022 We really enjoyed our week in this comfortable and well equipped villa with views of the sea and local mountains. The outside area was even better than in the photos with a lovely pool and garden of which we made good use. The area is particularly peaceful with no traffic noise. It is 15 minute walk to the beach and lake and there are two good tavernas within walking distance. Christos and Vasilis were excellent hosts  meeting us for check in and check out  and really reactive and helpful in sorting out any issues we had. Would strongly recommend this villa for anyone wanting a relaxing and peaceful holiday.
33991377,Peter September 2021 Still a great place to stay  the villa is lovely and Chalikounas is very quiet with a stunning beach.
33991377,Josep-Maria August 2021 Land of Sirius is an amazing house in a very nice area. It’s a superb place that we recommend without any reservation. The pool is fantastic and the house has a lot of privacy.
33991377,Dinos July 2021 Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. What a suitable name for this magnificient residence in which  my wife and me  experienced one of the most beautiful vacations we've ever had! We choosed this place after seing the photos to celebrate our 30th anniversary but the truth is that reality exceeded our expectations. An astonishing villa  perfectly isolated  offers you complete privacy and serenity. If you wish  you can live as close as it gets like Adam & Eve in Heaven. Without the snake this time. (Lol). All you may need  and further more  is provided by the very polite and sophisticated owner  Christos. The only thing you'll need to bring with you is your good mood. Nothing else. I don't know what to mention first: The self-cleaned pool that gathers almost no bugs  the view of the sun diving into the sea from the upper terrace  the barbeque  the plethora of sunbeds where you can relax for hours by the pool  the more than adequate kitchen equipment  the washing machine  the dish washer  the dvd player...the...the. The water is not only potable but very clean and tasty as well. I could talk for hours witout ending. It's the only place we felt we could spent all the time there. However  if you want to swim at the sea  there are several beautiful beaches nearby but you'll need a car. Our favorites: Chalicounas and it's extension  Issos and in top of all  Prasoudi  5 km from the villa with the breathtaking sunset. Overall  staying in Land of Sirius is an experience unforgetable  a lifetime memory. Dinos  Maria Hellas   June 2021 Show more Response from Χρήστος July 2021 Your kind words fill our hearts with joy. We are immensely satisfied you had such a memorable holiday  and we are grateful to meet such positive people. Accommodating you again in the future will be a bliss.

33991377,Peter September 2020 Very nice villa  garden and pool in a lovely secluded position. The pool is especially good as it doesn't attract leaves and insects like others always seem to. The water is also very clear and there is no chlorine smell. The Chalikounas area is unspoilt and quiet and the beach is spectacular. Only a few tavernas within walking distance with the Alonaki Bay being the best by far.
33991377,Marco August 2020 We are a family of 4 and we had a super 8 days in Chalikounas. The Villa has eveything you may need and the outside space is as good as it looks and perhaps better. The pool is a very good size with shade and places to relax etc around the pool. The Villa is located amongst olive groves so is very private and peacful. The nearest beach was quiet and watching the sunset as the sun disappeared into the sea is something we will remember. There are a couple of good local tavernas and we loved the nearest town which was very authentic with little or no tourism. A car is a must. A perfect spot on Corfu to relax and enjoy the swimming pool and the quieter beaches of the south west. Would would love to return one day.
33991377,Rachael August 2019 This lovely villa is tucked away around 1.5 k from a lovely  quiet sandy beach.  The villa is clean and very well equipped with lots of lovely modern features (automatic blackout window shutters  dimmer lights in the lounge  all doors have insect nets to stop bugs getting in).  The kitchen has everything you need to cook meals and snacks.  The outside space is incredible with a lovely pool and relaxing space. The pool uses natural filtration and is pristine and you don't come out smelling chemically.  The hosts have invested in good quality sizable and comfortable sofas indoors and sun loungers outside and lots of other comfortable outdoor seating. With an amazing outside BBQ space.  The balconies are lovely providing a great place to sit and watch the sunset in the evening with stunning seaviews from the upstairs bedroom and balconies.  The hosts are very friendly and welcoming and have gone out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Providing a few essentials and treats to get us going on our self catering stay.  It's great that the villa has high quality drinking water so you don't need to shell out on expensive bottled water.  The villa is a little remote so a car would be advisable.  We found some fab local tavernas and the local beach is large but not too busy but it doesn't have too many amenities (there are toilets and a basic and reasonably priced cafe and a surf hire place). There were lots of people wakeboarding there  I think the much needed sea breeze makes it a good place for wakeboarding.  If you go the more rural way to the beach (walking or driving) there is a lovely little spot where you can watch the stunning sunset over the sea.  Overall lovely stay nothing was too much trouble for the hosts who were super helpful and accommodating. Thank you for having us at your lovely villa. Show more
33991377,Carol July 2019 This is an amazing place . The house is well fitted out with modern and high standard fittings - sitting in the spa bath enjoying sea views and the sunset is a unique experience! There are fantastic views from the balconies and from the garden and around the pool . The pool is very special. Not only does the filtration system mean no chlorine but the design clears the pool surface as well. The way it is spaciously set in the landscape adds to the serenity and privacy of the place. Having the sheets and towels changed and bins emptied mid week was an added bonus. The owners go out of their way to make you welcome   with lots of lovely little touches that add to the overall luxurious feel of the villa. They are on call whenever you need them but are never intrusive. The house does not have a washing machine machine  but this wasn't a problem for us . You do need a car to get around and to the shops   the nearest beach and taverna were a little too far for us but others may well be better walkers ! If you want a peaceful  tranquil and relaxing holiday I can really recommend the Land of Sirius . It is a fabulous place and we had a wonderful time there . Thank you so much ! Show more
33991377,Ieva July 2019 First of all the hosts are really nice and caring. We were welcomed as soon as we landed and escorted to villa  hosts offered welcoming treats and were very caring during the whole stay. Thank you again! The place is beautiful inside out. It has everything you need for comfortable stay: fully equipped kitchen  big lounge area with tv  DVD player with plenty movies to choose from  books (even cook books)  cards and even fireplace. The interior is really nice  bedrooms are big and cozy  plenty of room to keep your belongings  all the rooms have A.C. The master bedroom is exceptional with nice jacuzzi and beautiful terrace with sunset view. Pool area is where you want to be all the time  it has everything: comfortable sunbeds  couple of lounge areas to chill and even fully equipped grill area with separate table. Villa surrounded with beautiful and well preserved trees  flowers and other plants that creates unique atmosphere. Villa offers a private stay  and you are always safe with two beautiful guard dogs :) It has a sea view from the upper terrace and also the view to the mountain which is just behind. Villa is just few mins drive from nice sandy beach where we spent most of the afternoons. There are few restaurants around and also the town is really close. We had a great stay and hope to be back soon! Show more

24283798,Eoin October 2022 Absolutely stunning place to stay - can’t recommend more. Close proximity to Corfu town (15/20min drive) and a great hub to explore the rest of the island from.  Vicky (the host in Corfu) met us in the first day to let us in and show us around. She is always on hand to help with anything. A great Airbnb and a great holiday.  Thank you Aphrodite and Giorgios Response from Aphrodite And Giorgos October 2022 Dear Eoin   Your generous feedback warmed our hearts  thank you so much.

24283798,Laila June 2022 If you’re looking for a place to stay in Greece  you don’t need to look any more. This villa is absolutely stunning  inside and outside. The inside is perfectly cleaned  beautiful minimal decor  AC in every room and the views from the balcony are gorgeous of the sea.

Aphrodite  George  Niki  Theodora  Christos and Vicky  are waiting to welcome you again with great pleasure!
24283798,Sophie June 2022 Such a beautiful villa with loads of space for the whole family. We took full advantage of the pool and outdoor dinning area. I would recommend getting a car as this made it easy for us to get around the island and do a bit of exploring. Would definitely recommend the villa and the host was so accommodating and would do anything to help make your stay enjoyable. ☀️💛 Response from Aphrodite And Giorgos July 2022 Dear Sophie! Our whole team thanks you very much  for your criticism which is a great motivation and encouragement in our work! We look forward to seeing you again! Greetings to all!
24283798,Tamara June 2022 We stayed in the villa with 9 girls of our soccer team and we can say it was the best trip ever. The villa was just gorgeous and a perfect stay for that many people!! We had the best time in the villa  everything required was there and it was super clean! Vicky  who did the hospitality there was our favorite. She is such a lovely woman with the biggest heart ever. She put so much effort in everything just to make us happy and it worked out pretty well. I can just say  we will definitely come back!!! Response from Aphrodite And Giorgos July 2022 Dear Tamara! Thanks so much for the nice review! The whole team strives to do the best for our guests! Again thank you for your kind words! We are sure you will come again!

You are wonderful! And we greatly appreciate every word of yours! We really want you to come back!
24283798,Anne April 2022 everything was perfect! had the best hostess! would love to come back:)
24283798,Ryan November 2021 The villa was super clean and the location was quite beautiful. We booked it for a family reunion after not having seen each other for quite a long time. Hanging out by the pool was super relaxing  and the balcony had an amazing view of the ocean. Thankfully  there was also enough space to take a break from the family when needed! The hosts were quick to reply to all of our questions with kind and thorough responses. They gave us great recommendations for restaurants and beaches (I highly recommend the restaurant right next to the villa  it was really good!). We didn’t rent a car as the local buses were very handy to get around and stopped super close to the villa. So  yeah  overall an excellent choice. A great holiday indeed!
24283798,Alice September 2021 What an amazing villa! Beautifully furnished with thoughtful design touches throughout the house  it is the perfect blend of new and old. It is spacious and homely and is equipped with everything you need. The garden area is beautiful too. The whole experience is amazing value for money.  Aphrodite and Giorgos have exquisite taste and are also the perfect hosts. Giorgos even paid a visit to the house to say hello and make sure everything was in order and to our liking. Check in was easy and Giorgos was communicative throughout  including allowing us an early checkin and later checkout.
24283798,Eleni September 2021 Our stay at Villa Pietra exceeded our expectations. Because it is actually rare to find all these qualities combined. We felt that there was provision for our comfort in every little detail. The villa is located in a vast garden full of different kinds of fruit trees and beautiful flowers and the view of the sea is just stunning. We were literally surrounded by nature at its best. All the indoor and outdoor spaces of the villa were super clean and beautifully arranged. What we enjoyed most was watching the sunrise from the balcony and of course the endless hours we spent by the pool. Also  there is a really good restaurant right outside the villa which serves delicious local dishes and fresh fish. Well  there isn’t much more we could ask for. The only downside is that we didn’t explore the rest of the island as much as we were initially planning to  because we just couldn’t get enough of the villa! And last but not least: The hosts were genuinely kind and helpful with all of our questions. 5 well-deserved * for our overall experience!
24283798,Savvas September 2021 We feel very lucky to have found this villa! The comfort and luxury in every small detail  the amazing private swimming pool  the view of the sea just in front of us  the spacious and really beautiful house  the super kind and helpful hosts… well  if you want to spoil yourselves  truly relax and feel like a rock star on holidays  this is the place to go! We also appreciated a lot the restaurant just around the corner and the fact that we could easily drive to town  but also explore a variety of fantastic beaches. Thank you Aphrodite and Giorgos for your warm hospitality  we look forward to coming back!
24283798,Ingrid September 2021 A stunning villa with beautiful views from the top balcony. The pool area is gorgeous with views of the mountains and glimpses of sea through the trees. The cleaner came twice during the week and the pool was also kept spotless. Corfu town is a 20 minute drive away and well worth visiting. We also particularly enjoyed a trip to the beautiful and quiet Halikounas beach and afterwards ate at Alonaki bay taverna. The local taverna at the end of the drive is also very friendly with excellent food. The only negative is that the villa is close to a busy road and the local lido hotel which had bands playing on a couple of nights during our stay. Mainly traditional Greek music which was ok and stopped by 11pm. I would definitely recommend this beautiful villa.
24283798,Katie August 2021 Lovely villa  really clean. Beautiful pool and well decorated. Very helpful hosts  providing cots and high chairs. Easy check in and check out. Quite a few beaches nearby. Cars are a must so that you can explore the island  though being at the villa is lovely too. The road beneath the villa can be quite noisy  though this was not an issue for us (it wasn’t noisy in the evening).
24283798,Lydie August 2021 The villa is very spacious  renovate with good taste  near the sea. Be aware if you are noise sensitive  the villa is near the road. Amazing pool and beautiful garden. Giorgos is very reactive and available. We recommend it !
24283798,Nevo July 2021 Wonderful place for vacation! Very recommend for anyone who wants to travel to Corfu with family or friends
24283798,Svetlana October 2020 We can honestly tell  that Afroditi and Giorgos are the best hosts we ever met. Comunication was super quick and easy  when we arrived we found lovely fruits and wine. Villa is super clean  and is actually even better then on the pictures. We been lucky to book it. Definatelly will come back. Just keep in mind even villa is near the water  there is no direct acess to it  and all nice beaches you will need to drive  so hiring a car is a must.
24283798,George October 2020 Afroditi and Giorgos were always very quick to respond  and super helpful with any questions we had - either to do with check-in/check-out or local recommendations. The villa is very spacious and stylishly decorated. Would recommend!
24283798,Millie September 2020 We could not fault our stay at Afroditi and Giorgios villa! The location is perfect  the villa is beautiful and clean but more over the hospitality that was provided was exceptional. They were always on hand to offer tips or help us book restaurants and transport and the regular visits by the cleaner  gardener and pool guy made us feel like we were staying in a 5* hotel. Highly recommend walking thew 250m to the beach down the road there is a beautiful jetty that is amazing both mornings and evenings. We would highly recommend this villa to anyone looking to stay in Corfu!
24283798,Ivan July 2020 We have enjoyed an unparalleled feast of hospitality  mixed with tremendous facilities matched and surpassed by the great logistical effort of ours hosts Giorgos and Afroditi in the most challenging circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The villa has provided our large family of 10 with the dream platform to explore the island. Our hosts have collated for us remarkable detailed informational planner  jam packed with wonderful local tips ranging from best beaches  carefully selected tavernas  particular grocery stores  sightseeing info and so much more. We felt pampered and spoiled for choice and made the most of our 8-night stay at this picturesque villa with lush mature manicured grounds  pristinely clean and maintained swimming pool and well equipped kitchen. We highly recommend the villa to prospective families and/or group of friends who are looking for great facilities only bettered by the unparalleled service of the hosts.
24283798,Desi July 2020 Wonderful house  sparkling cleanest   the most helpful and kind hosts... Everything was amazing!
24283798,Sian October 2019 Such a beautiful villa  with stunning views and great location! The villa was super clean and had everything you could need. The hosts were extremely kind and helpful and had great communication. They also gave us suggestions of what to do in Corfu. We did not have a car and found getting around not that difficult. There are bus stops right outside the villa which took you into Benitses and Corfu town. There were a few quiet beaches that were a short walk away. I would definitely come back to this villa without a doubt. Such a beautiful place.
24283798,Caeli October 2019 Our stay here was absolutely perfect! The villa is even more beautiful than you could imagine! The location is so peaceful  the pool is amazing  and the house is sparkling clean! The hosts are so helpful and wonderful people! Our stay here was more than we could have ever asked for!
24283798,Riga PBSA October 2019 We had an amazing time of 8 ladies in this wonderful villa. We did not expected such a hospitality  help with trips  transport  shopping and other  such as cleaning service when needed. Even locals supermarkets were so friendly that brought some food to our villa when asked. We are super happy that we chose this place. We definetly recommend it to everyone and hope to come back here too. Thank you Giorgos and Afroditi very much!
24283798,Erko October 2019 If this villa is available at your dates  stop searching and book this villa. It is absolutely amazing. We stayed there with three families. That modern villa is big enough for four families and it is very child-friendly. The pool area is nice and big with enough sunbeds for everyone. The kitchen is large and well-equipped. There is also a plenty of room for just relaxing and chilling. Having breakfast on the upstairs romantic balcony with a sunrise and sea view is an absolute “must have”. The location is perfect. As it is about in the middle of the island  you can reach every part of the island within a reasonable driving time. If you are travelling by bus  the bus stop is less than 100 m from the villa. You feel yourself like in a 5 star hotel. The cleaning lady cleans the rooms and changes towels often. The hosts are the best host you can have. They are always there for you if you need anything  and they always think one step ahead of you in order to make your vacation memorable. Will definitely recommend!
24283798,Suzi August 2019 The villa is amazing and the pool fantastic.
24283798,Pierre-Emmanuel August 2019 The house is very comfortable . The garden is a paradise and Afroditi and Giorgos are very kinds and have a lot of attentions for their guests. Thanks a lot for your warm welcome !
24283798,Lisa August 2019 We loved staying at Afroditi and Giorgos’s villa.  They are wonderful  friendly and responsive hosts and the villa is simply beautiful. It’s a well designed and stylish space with lots of thoughtful touches... perfect for relaxing on your own with a book in a shady spot  barbecuing and eating as a family or splashing in the lovely pool.  Close to tavernas  shops and really nice beaches... walkable or 5 minutes by car. Also a handy bus stop right outside.  We can’t think of much that can be bettered and look forward to staying again in future.
24283798,Dina July 2019 This villa is even more gourgous in person. It was beautiful  modern  and spotless. Everything we expected and more. Afroditi and Giorgos were amazing hosts and made sure we had everything we needed including suggestions for the area. We had a lovely family weekend.
24283798,Natalie July 2019 We had a lovely stay  the villa has recently been refurbished and looks amazing. The villa is well appointed and we had a very comfortable  relaxing stay. The pool and the area surrounding it is beautiful. The upstairs balcony has lovely views and is a great place to sit whilst having a drink or eating dinner. Giorgos and Afroditi are lovely hosts and any issues or questions we had were dealt with promptly.
24283798,Krystal July 2019 Amazing villa in a beautiful spot with lovely gardens pool the perfect place for a great getaway
24283798,Callum July 2019 This Villa is an amazing space  very clean  beautiful garden & pool area. Our group had a fantastic time. Afroditi and Giorgos were very kind hosts  with great communication before and during the stay  and they were also very helpful and understanding when we had a delayed flight on arrival. We highly reccommend. Thank you both!
24283798,Doina Simona June 2019 The place is very nice  it is a pleasure to stay here. A lot of lovely flowers  wonderful view of the sea. I was very happy with my big family there. I recommend with all my heart!We want to comeback there.
24283798,Imogen June 2019 A stunning villa - recently refurbished to a very high standard. Very comfortable both inside and out and well equipped. Spotlessly clean. The garden looks and smells fantastic and there is plenty of space for everyone with shady spots for siestas under the olive trees! Great location with beaches  towns and tavernas easily accessible. Afroditi and Giorgios couldn't have been more helpful - any (very small) issues and questions dealt with almost instantly. You can hear the road from time to time  but you can't see it and it's easy to tune it out. A blissful haven for rest and relaxation - highly recommended.
24283798,Irini June 2019 A wonderful place to be!!! We recommend this villa 100%!!! We were 5 adults and 4 kids. Everybody was fully satisfied. The hosts are very nice and helpful and their staff too. The villa is both inside out very luxurious. At the beginning and the end a surprise awaits you. The inside is stylishly furnished  very clean and you have everything you need. Almost every day the cleaning woman cleans the house. The pool area is very clean too and the garden is wonderful taken care with much love. In the garden you have the possibility to barbecue. We did it a few times. And last but not least  the view was breathtaking!!! Thank you very much for everything Aphroditi and Giorgos!!! You deserve more than 5 stars!!!!!
24283798,Anne June 2019 This is a fantastic find!! The beautiful villa  garden  and pool were just what we were looking for to wind down after a busy travel schedule. The island is gorgeous and there are many fine restaurants and beaches nearby. Our hosts were especially thoughtful and attentive—we had a lovely basket of wine  fresh fruit and local spacialties waiting for us when we checked in. A small glitch with the washing machine was fixed immediately. They truly made our stay perfect.  This is one place we will be sure to recommend to family and friends. we would return in a heartbeat!!
24283798,Sharon June 2019 Fabulous villa and pool  really clean  the cleaner came several times  just a bit close to the road but didn’t bother us.
24283798,Thomas May 2019 The villa has recently been renovated and is very attractive with lovely views. The facilities are good and bathrooms are very nice. The pool and gardens are very attractive as well. You will need a rental car to get around. The hosts were very helpful and kind.
24283798,Ben January 2019 The host canceled this reservation 217 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
24283798,Ramzi August 2018 Great place for a short stay in Corfu!
24283798,Piet May 2022 Beautiful spacious villa  clean with nice pool. Perfect for large families or multiple groups. Despite the fact that the bus stops practically in front of the door with which you can be in the center of Corfustad in half an hour  renting a car is necessary to explore the island further. Great service by the always accessible and nearby manager. Conclusion  it is highly recommended to rent this villa. Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Aphrodite And Giorgos May 2022 Thank you so much! So happy and happy to always be! We will be happy to host you again! Translated  Show original
6779432,Pascal October 2022 This villa is perfect to relax and the vue is outstanding. The host’s are really amazing  they respond really quickly and are welcoming. The beach is easily accessible and there’s many great restaurants around. We will be back in this location for sure .
6779432,Mikaela October 2022 Julia and Anthony are welcoming and helpful. The Villa is in a wonderful location with plenty of beautiful walks to small beaches and excellent tavernas. The view from the pool is very special  and the house has everything you need for a relaxing stay.
6779432,Erinn September 2022 We had a wonderful stay here! The pool has the most amazing views. The rooms are comfortable (each with an AC unit) and 2 bathrooms are nice for a bigger group. The town is a hard and steep 15 min walk away but it has a lovely waterfront  some restaurants and shops. There’s also a bus stop right outside the flat if you don’t have a car. There are lots of cats in the area who may try to come inside if you don’t shut the doors.
6779432,Jane June 2022 We fell in love with this villa. Wonderful pool that wasn't overlooked but had an amazing view out over Kalami  the sea and Albania. Relaxing setting  a very easy villa to live in (water cooler for a small charge  towels  everything needed in the kitchen etc). We were sad to leave.
6779432,Rajan May 2022 Villa is in prime location for wonderful photos  very clean  neighbours are friendly and helpful. Anthony and Julia are superb hosts and helped us a lot
6779432,Sue May 2022 Nice location. Perfect for visiting Durrell house and restaurant. Views were stunning from the terrace. Shower and bathroom could maybe benefit from an upgrade. Welcome and help from Anthony very good  and instructions for how to find the house were excellent. We felt welcome and well- supported.
6779432,Anna April 2022 Most Beautiful Place
6779432,Jamie April 2022 The place was fantastic and Tony/Julia were very welcoming and helpful. The views are incredible and the siting of the pool is unrivalled! The rooms are well furnished and the house is well equipped for small children (has a travel cot and a high chair (T/J were happy to replace the high chair on short notice when we noticed a missing clip!)  The house is approximately a 15min walk down to Kalami. There is a footpath starting just over the road but I would suggest good footwear as it can be slippery and probably best not attempted at night.  The only negatives were completely out of Tony's/Julia's control so for advice only:  We travelled in March/April and were really unfortunate with the weather (storms/rain/cloudy) so the the house was a little cold to begin with. There are heaters in the house but as with most Mediterranean homes the floors are tiled so remain cold to the touch. My advice is to bring socks  we came with a slightly optimistic wardrobe.  Corfu has a surplus of cats (whether they are owned or stray is unclear) and there were several hanging about begging for food and we once caught one sneeking into the kitchen to help themselves to leftovers. They seem friendly but best to make sure food is not left out.  People have mentioned the steep drive and struggle with access. We had a fairly large car and managed ok.  If you're travelling before May it's important to note that all the restaurants and supermarkets in the walkable villages are shut. The closest we found were either in Kassiopi or Ipsos but for a proper shop you're best heading to Lidl in Corfu Town.  Tap water shouldn't be drunk unless boiled. Tony has a water cooler and replacement bottles for a small fee or you can buy bottled water in the supermarkets (about €1 for 6 big 1.5l bottles).  On the whole this place is amazing and we can't fault the hosts. Would happily come again  just in the Summer ☺️ Show more
6779432,Charles October 2021 This is a really lovely villa. It’s in a great location with wonderful views. It’s peaceful but at the same time within minutes of awesome beaches  restaurants and olive forests. The villa itself is well kitted out  spacious and has a lovely feel to it. The pool is very private and has unbelievable views.
6779432,Mike October 2021 Fantastic location and facilities  spotlessly clean. Thank you for being so hospitable.
6779432,Fons October 2021 Beautiful location  beautiful views  nice beds and typical Greek styling - amazing stay!!
6779432,Katja September 2021 Dear Antony and Julia  thanks so much for this last minute welcome! The pool with its stunning view is the highlight of the house!! All the best and stay healthy! Katja
6779432,Todd July 2021 Idyllic. A perfect location  tucked onto a hillside  in a quite part of Corfu. Tony and Julia were gracious hosts who are proud of their villa and its history. Communication was top notch  the villa was well-furnished and supplied  and the views...  We hope to visit again soon.
6779432,Wilko July 2021 Beautiful villa with lovely hosts made our stay with baby and toddler a wonderful experience. Highlights were the swimming pool and deck with great views of the Kalami bay  the comfortable outside dining area and homely feel of the property.
6779432,Geoff November 2020 Amazing views and all the amenities you need! Bars and beach are a steep trip away  which we only did by car. Could be done walking if you're fit! Lovely quiet area of the island
6779432,Fabien October 2020 Amazing house with a wonderful view & super hosts!!! I would highly recommend this house if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing place!
6779432,David October 2020 We really enjoyed the time in the villa! The pool is clean and big  the view is amazing!We can highly recommend this place and Tony and Julia are very welcoming and friendly hosts! Thank you for everything!

6779432,Anna September 2020 Amazing house in unbelievable location. We loved hanging out next to the beautiful pool admiring the views over Albania  thank you!
6779432,Jenny August 2020 Such a beautiful and unexpected stay in Corfu. The villa was beautiful and the pool overlooking the coast was exceptional. The inside of the villa isn’t anything special but it doesn’t matter because the outside is amazing. The bbq and dining area was lovely for a group dinner. The owner was very helpful and made us feel welcome. The only thing to mention was how difficult the driveway was to get up to with such a large vehicle - so park on the main road if you too have a big car.
6779432,Hassan October 2019 The host canceled this reservation 294 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6779432,Manuela September 2019 Beautiful villa  with a great pool and amazing view! Super clean  neat and very spacious villa with a great flexible host. We had a wonderful stay at the villa  we all loved the pool! The beautiful quiet beach in Kalami is only a short drive away  as is Kassiopi with all its lively restaurants and shops.
6779432,Ed August 2019 Well kept spacious villa with great views from the pool  but a steep walk to the beach.
6779432,Amelia August 2019 Tony was very hands on deck  making sure our stay was seamless. Amazing views from the pool and the location was ideal in terms of beaches  restaurants and the nearby Kassiopi. My family and I really enjoyed our stay  it was perfect for what we needed.
6779432,Sebastien July 2019 Superb villa  fully equipped  lots of space  view to die for... Tony and Julia were very friendly and welcoming. We spent 4 days in their villa and we had a great time.
6779432,Corie July 2019 This property is a fantastic find. Great pool with spectacular views. Tony and Julia were wonderful hosts. They were very quick to respond to all communication  left a thoughtful welcome basket and just made us feel at home. We are already talking about when we can come back.
6779432,Irene July 2019 Lovely place  wonderful terrace and swimming pool  perfect for families with children.
6779432,Linda July 2019 A lovely hilltop villa with amazing views  gorgeous pool and wonderful host who helped us have a great holiday.
6779432,Catherine June 2019 This villa is in a stunning location between Kalami and Agni. It is amazing value and is very accurately pictured and described in details. The view from the pool terrace is amazing. The perfect location for a Durrell inspired holiday.
6779432,Chris May 2019 Villa Chrysoula is a truly wonderful place and our party of 6 was very happy with everything. The facilities  location and the especially the view were amazing. The only drawback was the steep and narrow access to the villa but once we had navigated it a few times it was fine. Tony and Julia  many thanks for everything!
6779432,Paolo April 2019 One of the best spot to visit Corfu and stay in peace when you come back home. The pool and its panorama on the sea is something of incredible. The beds are confortable  there is the barbeque  two places to have your dinner outside and one inside. All the rooms are the A/C and there are two bathrooms... what do you want more? You have all you need to spend your holiday time in the best way possible.
6779432,Chris April 2019 Villa Chrysoula is a wonderful place. It is clean and has all the equipment you need for a relaxed holiday. The pool is super clean with comfortable sunbeds and a stunning view. There is plenty of space in the lovely garden and you have the choice between 3 terraces at the villa to eat outside. The village of Gimari is very small  but the surrounding villages and beaches are very close by. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the closest beach. We went cycling and horse riding  both within half an hour by car from the villa. Tony is a wonderful and thoughtful host. We highly recommend staying at villa Chrysoula.
6779432,Will October 2018 Villa Chrisoula is absolutely perfect for a family holiday. Everything is clean and tidy  the rooms all a decent size  and the children loved the pool and the BBQ  and there was plenty of terraces outside to sit and eat or read a book. The views from the villa towards Albania were amazing too!  It is a short but steep walk down to Kalami where there is beach  shops and restaurants  although we'd recommend hiring a car to get around and see the island. The best thing though was our hosts  Tony and Julia who were just super lovely and so helpful  making our holiday one that we'll never forget  we'd love to come back again soon!
6779432,Liz October 2018 This is a lovely villa with fantastic views. The location is great with some really nice tavernas within walking distance. The welcome pack was much appreciated and our hosts were extremely helpful. Would happily stay again.
6779432,Colette September 2018 The view was amazing  amazing place to stay. Best choice on the whole island. The villa has plenty of room and is a nice location.
6779432,Paul September 2018 A family of four  we stayed three days and nights and loved it. A quiet spot in Gimari  a village overlooking Kalami bay with lovely views out to sea from the house and pool. It’s possible to walk down to the beach in about fifteen minutes. Tony  the owner  was there to see us in. Easy going and friendly  he made us very welcome and was helpful with advice about the locale—best places to shop for food  who best to speak to to hire a boat  etc. Just a really good place to stay. We’d definitely return.
6779432,Sarah July 2018 We had a great week at Tony's place. The accommodation was spacious and well equipped. There was plenty of outdoor space with amazing views from the pool terrace. We cooked on the barbeque a couple of times. There are lovely walks down to the sea from the house  but don't try walking back up in the heat of the day! Looking forward to going back one day. Sarah Tony and family.
6779432,Seb July 2018 Great views from the villa which has a lovely pool and outside area. Tony was a great host and always responded quickly to any of our queries. AC in the bedrooms as well which helps during summer! If you are staying longer than a day or two then a car is probably essential - some beaches are walking distance but the roads are very narrow and it will be a hilly walk back up to the villa.
6779432,Adie June 2018 Fabulous place  awesome views  In a beautiful quiet bay.Lots of info/ little extras provided . Discounted boat hire well worth it for a different view of the coastline.
6779432,Esther May 2018 We absolutely loved staying at Villa Chrysoula! The garden and swimming pool are beautiful with a amazing view on Corfu. Wished we could stay a couple days longer! Toni was very kind and helpfull. The villa also include towels (also beachtowels) which is very handy! We definitely recommend this Villa!
6779432,Edith May 2018 Nice family house (sleeps 6)  located on a hillside  with beautiful terassed outside area and a stunning view from the swimming pool terrace. The house is located at the end of a small road  in a very private location. The owner (Tony) is very friendly and helpful. There are 2 beautiful bays on walking distance (Kalami and Agni)  other facilities to be reached by car.
6779432,Charlotte April 2018 Stunning view  great villa  nice quiet village  beautiful garden  the view is exceptional. Much more beautiful than you see online. Tony and Julia very kind. Day trip to Albania big fun. Hire your car at arrival in Albania (100 meters past the customs building on the right site). Boat goes daily (Ionian cruises in Kerkyra town).
6779432,Joseph April 2018 Absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much!
6779432,Upi April 2018 This is such a lovely gem tucked away in the beautiful mountains. The views from the house are absolutely breathtaking! Tony and Julia were such amazing hosts who made sure that all our basic needs were well catered for.  A truly memorable holiday and would love to go back for more!
6779432,Caroline October 2017 This place is lovely. The position and view is great. The local Kalami beach a nice walking distance of 15 minutes. We really loved the walk. The villa is really clean and well provided  other than quite hard beds - otherwise no criticism. The hosts were lovely and really responsive if needed. We even got a free boat for the day (just paying the petroleum) which was a great perk. The pool was chilly but that's the time of year for us (October half term) - the sea was fine though although not many people swimming other than us - nice! The only other warning I would say is the little road up to the villa is very steep and narrow so don't be tempted to get a big hire car if you don't need it. I'd highly recommend this place though
6779432,Virginia October 2017 Villa Chrysoula is in a spectacular position with outstanding views East  North and South. The garden area has been lovingly designed and the pool a work of art! Our hosts  Tony and Julia  provided a beautiful  clean home and we wanted for absolutely nothing. A welcome pack awaited us  chilled wine  fresh eggs  butter  bread  cheese  ham and fresh fruit. The crowning glory was having a water cooler in the kitchen with 10 litre bottles  brilliant!
6779432,Wendy September 2017 Tony was an excellent host  who greeted us at the villa and helped us with our suitcases. The villa was tucked away from the main road  with fantastic views across the water and very clean accommodation. We were able to walk to the local taverna's which was nice. We had a nice stay :-)
6779432,Edward September 2017 Great pool.  Amazing views.  Great bbq and outside area.  Comfy and clean rooms.  Great host - very helpful
6779432,Christiane August 2017 Great House & Pool  awesome views!!!
6779432,Rosy July 2017 Lovely host. Clean. Private. Not in tourist area. Great pool. Excellent view. Country villa.
6779432,Sean June 2017 Fantastic host and amazing views. Pool is fantastic. Anything we needed during our stay tony was able to provide. Would highly recommend
6779432,Pat October 2016 Wow. I don't really want to write this review as I want to keep this gem just for us but that would not be fair to our hosts  Tony and Julia.  We were delayed almost 5 hours but even though it was 2am Tony was waiting patiently at the Villa and gave us a full tour. He had left a welcome pack of a bowl full of fruit  bread  eggs  jam  milk  orange juice  ham  cheese and even a bottle of wine! The villa is quite isolated from shops so the food was brilliant.  The worst thing about the villa is the very steep and narrow drive up to villa  especially in the dark  but as long as none of neighbours drive at same time  you get used to it. All the roads in Corfu are challenging when compared to UK.  The charm of the villa and the spectacular views took our breath away. We loved it!!!  Take your mosquito repellent and plug ins as even in October and despite nets on all windows  we were bitten.  The pool was cold (unheated) but if you wait until late morning it is warm enough for a swim.  Kalami beach is the nearest village and we ate at The Durrells White House  Vitamins in Nikasi and at Tavernia in lovely Kassiopi. Nice walk along the coast with a footpath joining Agni beach to Kalami. If you are up for a challenging walk down to Kalami  turn left at the bottom of the drive and at the sign to Kalami walk between the houses to a footpath that comes out near The White House. It is a steep downhill walk so keep enough energy for walk back up.  When driving to villa  it is in Gimari (Tony's detailed directions are spot on) but when you get to the only traffic light on the coast road (outside of Corfu town) turn sharp left and go up  up  up...  We will definitely be going back.  Pat  Paul & Matt Show more
6779432,Jenny September 2016 I went to Villa Chrysoula with 4 friends for a week this month and we had a fantastic time! From the moment we booked in February the communication with Tony and his wife has been excellent and they are brilliant hosts. The photos are a true likeness of the villa and we couldn't fault anything when we got there. The villa and outdoor area is very clean  tidy and very well equipped - we had a couple of barbecues and had everything we needed. Kalami is a short walk away for shops and the lovely beach  few restaurants/bars. We hired a car to explore the local area  but would recommend getting the smallest car possible due to the narrow  uphill driveway (our car hire company gave us a Mercedes instead of our preferred option!!) We'd recommend Dimitri's and White House restaurant  Dimitri's kindly offer a local lifts and can pick you up :) Tony was brilliant in providing local information and popping over the look after the swimming pool during bad weather we had. He also came over midweek to change towels etc. We'd definitely recommend this villa and would go again. Thank you again to Tony and Julia. Show more
6779432,Will July 2016 Villa Chrysoula is a hidden gem. It is truly beautiful and the perfect place to enjoy a break in Corfu. Tony is a fantastic host and has such attention to detail. I would recommend staying here to anyone.
6779432,Martin May 2022 The villa is located on a hillside in a cute little village  the place is large  with plenty of outdoor living spaces. A large pool is our joy after a long day of exploring the island. The three bedrooms are comfortable and the kitchen well equipped with some surprises left by the owner. We had a wifi outage but the owner took care of it quickly and effectively. Translated from French  Show original
6779432,Marian May 2022 This is a fantastic place. The house is really very top! Everything is there  on arrival there was fruit and water and there are plenty of towels. Even play things and water shoes for the kids. Even a cooler for going to the beach. Also in the cupboards  sugar  tea  coffee  salt and herbs everything is ready. Toilet paper is provided and hand soap. Also a dishwasher with dishwasher tablets. A beautiful pool with an amazing view. The owner and his wife are hugely hospitable and everything is possible. However  a car is necessary! So you can get anywhere to the most beautiful places. We will definitely come back. Translated from Dutch  Show original
6779432,David November 2021 We had a lovely week in Corfu even at this time of year. It's very nice because it's a lot less crowded and the weather is still very mild !

6779432,Loeske July 2020 Incredibly nice holiday home in a beautiful place! We would definitely recommend this place! We stayed here for 2 nights with 4 adults and 2 children (for very small children the house is not very child-friendly. There are many stairs in and outside the house  this requires attentiveness. There is a camping bed and a high chair available  very nice and convenient!) A rental car is necessary  we found the distance to the beach too far to walk. The distance to restaurants and supermarket is also not within walking distance. With a car  this is all not a problem. The swimming pool is wonderful  the equipment in the kitchen is ample so you can cook for yourself whenever you want. The double bed is lovely  softer than most other beds in Greece. The neighbors came several times to bring fresh vegetables from their vegetable garden  very nice! Communication with host went very well! We were allowed to check in early and check out late. Translated from Dutch  Show original
6779432,Ingrid October 2019 The house is within walking distance of a beautiful bay but nice and quiet a bit up the mountain. This gives you a spectacular view by the pool. The pool is lovely. The kitchen is a nice space and you can walk to your terrace in no time. Inside  there is another lovely sofa on the loungers. All in all a top house! Translated from Dutch  Show original

Fully equipped (e.g. 2 bathrooms: 1 with bath  1 with shower). Very clean  well maintained '70s style interior. Tony is an enthusiastic host who welcomes you with fruit and wine. Nice walk to the sea below (about 20 minutes). Our 15-year-old son would love to come back! Translated from Dutch  Show original
6779432,Maurizio June 2017 House in a beautiful location and beautiful pool. George is very attentive and welcoming.

6779432,Alessandro May 2016 The welcome and stay were great  the house is really beautiful and equipped with everything you need  including a barbecue  dishwasher  washing machine  and coffee maker. The view from the pool is breathtaking  you can see the Epiro mountains rising over the sea. Two things I think are important: It's not really close to a village\village  so just in case you need a car! Translated from Italian  Show original
6779432,Noortje May 2016 We were in Corfu with 5 friends (+/- 26 years) for 4 days. We enjoyed ourselves very much. Of course because of the beautiful green island with the beautiful bays  but also certainly thanks to Tony's hospitality! A cozy Greek who will take good care of you during your stay. His villa was lovely. The view from the pool is incredibly beautiful. You can see Albania and there is a beautiful blue sea in front of it. The photos don't lie about it.  Tony thank you for everything! And maybe see you soon. Translated from Dutch  Show original

39039346,Amelia September 2022 We had the most amazing week here! The apartment was so spacious and clean  and we really enjoyed breakfast in the sun on the terrace every morning! Really comfortable beds and they come in to change sheets and towels during the week which was a nice touch. Would recommend having a car to explore the island and the free parking right outside made this super easy!  Highlight of the week was the bottle of wine and homemade cake we had given to us by the host and his wife  which so kind and absolutely delicious! Would defiantly recommend staying here!

39039346,Adriatik August 2022 We had a pleasant stay and were made to feel very welcome despite a few hiccups with the check in. The cleaner was super helpful and helped us to book a taxi to the ferry port. The Apartment is in a decent location but for the price it needs to have a washing machine.

39039346,Michael July 2022 We really had a good time in Corfu and the house is located in a silent side street. You can get to the beach in an 5-min walk. There are some but not so many tourists in the area. Don't miss the local restaurants and markets for shopping. The modern and renovated apartment itself was very tidy and there can't be said a bad thing about it. All went flawless. We can totally recommend booking with Sofronios. Michael and Jenny.

39039346,Louise October 2020 My partner and I have just come back from an amazing stay at Sofronios’s place! Upon arrival we had a lovely welcome basket with local snacks and a bottle of wine. The owner lives in the same building and he greeted us on arrival and ordered us some food as we arrived late and the island has a midnight curfew for bars and restaurants. He even came the following day with a freshly baked cake for us. Any questions we had  were answered very quickly and they couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly. The location of the apartment was great! Close to supermarkets  the beach  local activities and bus stops if you want to use public transport. Plenty of things to do in the area and easy if you want to travel out further to other parts of the island. I have never been Corfu before and it’s honestly a beautiful place  the apartment made our stay even better and would recommend friends and family travelling to Corfu to stay here! We definitely will again next time we visit. Thank you for everything! Louise and Harvey x Response from Sofronios October 2020 Dear Louise  Hello from Eos Villas.

39039346,Simon October 2020 Wow! What a fantastic apartment.  Centrally located  peacefully tucked away from the main road yet within a stones throw of a supermarket  a lovely coffee shop and bus stop to enable you to conveniently access the island. The local beach is a less than a five minute walk away and there are plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from.  Our apartment was spotlessly clean  ultra modern and had everything we needed. Lovely sofas  cooker  microwave  fridge freezer  kettle  coffee machine  pots  pans and ample glasses  cups  plates etc. Iron  hairdryer and great sized TVs to the living area and bedroom. Fantastic shower room  soft towels and high quality bed linen. The black out curtains were very much appreciated for our relaxing time away. There is an outdoor seating area leading area off the bedroom and a wonderful spacious terrace to the front with table and chairs and additional shower.  Our hosts left us a welcome bottle of wine  bottled water  local snacks  sweets and oils. A lovely touch.  We will certainly return.

39039346,David June 2022 The apartment in Dasia is very modern and tastefully furnished. Check-in was easy and independent via the key safe. We were surprised by the hospitality and the attentions such as vinegar/oil  biscuits  crackers and 2 bottles of water. The space is very good and spacious (about 40-50 sqm). The kitchen is functionally furnished and the equipment is sufficient for 4 people and the occasional cooking is completely sufficient. The bedroom is cozy and you have peace out the back (in front it is also quiet) and a small balcony  accessible through a large sliding glass door. The bed / mattress is comfortable and we slept well. There is also an LCD TV with satellite TV (including German channels) and Netflix  Amazon Video  etc. On the wall is a wall shelf with hanging facilities for clothes. The bathroom and shower are spacious and there are 2 shower heads (rain shower / hand shower). We particularly liked the fluffy and good smelling towels. In our week  these were even changed. In total  there were also 2 cleaning dates (announced in advance by EOS Travel) of the entire apartment. That was also fine. There is plenty of space in the living room and next to the entrance to the bathroom there is a built-in wardrobe for clothes and a hotel safe. The couch is cozy and you sit/lie very well on it. The large TV is also well positioned here on the wall. Here  too  is a large sliding glass door with access to the large front terrace with a table and four chairs  an outdoor shower and a small green area. Everything very neat and well maintained. Here you can have a nice breakfast or enjoy the evening. The apartment is located on a quiet side street without through traffic. From Dasia you can easily explore the island in all directions. If you have a rental car  you can park right outside the door.

11557264,Ran October 2022 Disclaimer: This review is lacking in that it cannot in any way truly convey the real quality of Xenonerantzia  its hosts and the stay that you can have while on Corfu. I am sure that after staying here you will agree that only seeing (and experiencing this place) is believing. It is really far too good to be true (but it is!!!).  After having stayed at numerous accommodations around the world  I can honestly say that Xenonerantzia easily outrates them all. The house  its location  and  last but definitely not least  its owners are in a class of their own insuring that a stay with them will not only flawless  but also the best that can be had.  The house  which is located in central Corfu allowing easy and quick access (by car) to almost anywhere on the island (nothing is more than an hour away  the airport and the old town of Kerkyra about 20 minutes  the beach  restaurants and shops less than 10)  will stun you upon arrival. This is no regular  average house – it is a work of art situated in a landscape which is second to none.  I can only describe in superlatives the qualities of this property – the most beautifully decorated and fully equipped rooms  the most modern infinity swimming pool with the most breathtaking view  best ever atmosphere  closest to nature – I can go on and on  but as I stated in the disclaimer  only seeing is believing.  Not only the property itself  but the hosts too  live up to the same unbelievable standard – simply the best and nicest hosts that I have ever encountered. Always available buy never bothersome  always helpful and amiable and full of surprises (Julia and Yorgos will spoil you with their exquisite culinary treats). Any requests will be dealt with immediately.  If you are looking for a special holiday  I cannot recommend any place more than Xenonerantzia. Show more
11557264,Sandie September 2022 Do not hesitate to book this Villa. Gorgeous from top to bottom and every detail is beautifully thought out. The view and pool are magnificent and it’s very close to everything but peaceful and serene on the property. Julia was an amazing host bringing us fresh baking daily. She had food and wine waiting for us and her husband made fresh crepes the first morning. There were plenty of towels  all amenities for cooking anything you like and and a beautiful outdoor kitchen dining room. We wish we could stay FOREVER.
11557264,Kevin August 2022 We have just returned from a week stay in Julia and George's amazing villa. We have stayed at several other Air BnBs in Greece and Majorca and this was a cut above the rest. The main feature is am amazing outside area with infinity pool and views across the Adriatic to Albania. The inside has an a very well appointed kitchen with stocks of the basics such as oil  herbs  tea  coffee which are often missing from rental properties. However the main thing that made the stay special were the hosts  Julia and George. It is very obvious that this is their home  not just a holiday rental  and they have put a lot of love into making it a lovely place to stay. Julia dropped round freshly prepared food most days such as a traditional cake.  On a more practical note  the property is 1-2 km from Gouvia which is a tourist town with small beach and lots of restaurants. It is 20 min drive to Corfu Town with easy parking  historic streets and shops. I would say a car is essential  supermarket and restaurants are not quite within walking distance.  Overall  the best property we have ever rented  I would recommend. Show more
11557264,Mark August 2022 Wow. Just wow. If your looking for a home with breathtaking views  kind and attentive hosts and a space that just oozes creativity and love then Julia and George’s is the one for you.  Xenonerantzia is just a stunning villa that blends in beautifully to the luscious green hillside.  Each and every room is beautifully decorated and contains countless pieces of hand carved art made by its owner George that gives the whole space a real creative family vibe. The piano and board games is the lounge room were a particular highlight.  The outside spaces are just to die for. The view from the pool is simply stunning and we genuinely struggled to drag ourselves away from it each day to visit the island.  The pool itself is super clean and more than big enough for a family of four. The multicoloured pool lighting was so inviting that we spent most evenings floating away staring at the stars without a care in the world. If you like astronomy then George’s telescope is also a must.  The bbq kitchen  multiple balconies  woods and hammocks (oh my word the hammocks) kept the whole family occupied from dawn to dusk. And if you love food then Julia’s food parcels (cakes  stuffed peppers  ice cream and ouzo) are the perfect tonic after a long day exploring this beautiful island.  One note though is that you certainly need a car to get around as the villa is on a steep hill and not the easiest place to walk to.  I have to say that I couldn’t fault the place even if I tried and it’s by far and away one of the best places I’ve ever stayed (hotels included). We have already started talking about coming back again next year.  Thank you so much George and Julia for a wonderful stay. Show more

11557264,Jon August 2022 We were looking for something that extra special for our family holiday  and we really found it in Villa Xenonerantzia. Julia and her husband George were so welcoming  and Julia’s traditional food and cakes were a lovely treat. The views and the outside pool area were absolutely stunning  and we happily spent most of our time there. The villa was extremely clean and well stocked with all you needed and so much more. The feel of the house and it’s grounds  with pieces of art and well thought out areas  made our stay perfect. We loved the outside kitchen and dining area. We would love to return to the villa and Corfu again. Thank you again.
11557264,Gretchen July 2022 Julia & George’s home is beautifully appointed and super comfortable. Our entire family loved the house—we had a hard time leaving it! The view of the sea and Corfu Town is spectacular. The pool area was where we spent most of our time—lounging on the sofa  in the loungers  swimming  playing in the shade with our toddler. The home had everything we could have needed/wanted and more…. Julia and George frequently brought us food  everything from cake to moussaka. Julia bought a truck for my young son and a ring for my pre-teen—so thoughtful! George taught us to make Greek frappes and arranged a painting workshop for our children. We painted wood fish to take home and remember our trip! The house is in an amazing location in the hills above town. It was easy to get everywhere on the island by car  and the family gave great recommendations. Communication was excellent. You won’t regret booking this home—it was our best “home away” experience ever and by far. Thank you  Julia and George! Our trip was so special!
11557264,Kathryn July 2022 My friends and I had the most wonderful time at Julia & George’s house! Everything was as it appears in the pictures  the beds were comfy and the views amazing. We felt so looked after by Julia - who gave us great tips of things to do on the island. A car is definitely a must to stay here - and having a car in corfu allows you to see so much more of this beautiful island. We are already making plans to come back here we loved it so much!
11557264,Emily July 2022 Best Airbnb experience we’ve ever had! Julia’s villa is gorgeous - beautifully designed but with a home-y and personal feel with lots of lovely touches throughout. The pool is perfect and no chlorine which is a joy. The inside space was perfect for two families and another adult ( 5 x adults  1 x toddler  1 x baby in total)  with a terrace and bathroom for each room. The villa feels lovely  creative and personal  with a piano  record player and lots of lovely art and cook books. The whole place is very comfortable with aircon in each room. The kitchen is amazingly well stocked with equipment and feels like a cook’s kitchen.  The view from the pool over the bay and across to the mountains in Albania was just stunning. The villa is set on beautiful lush land and the rich sound of crickets. The outside bbq area is fantastic and very well equipped.  You will need a car to get to the beach and supermarket but neither are very far and the island has some beautiful beaches to discover by car. But we didn’t leave the villa that much as it was so perfect!  Julia and George were also the best hosts! They waited up late for us when our flight was delayed to welcome us in  gave us tips for the island  dropped off delicious home cooked food (almost like magic exactly when we needed it)  checked we were ok  showed us how to work the record player  dropped off arm bands for my three year old son  set up the baby monitor and so much more - they generally made us feel so welcome and looked after.  We would highly recommend staying here and plan to come again! Show more
11557264,Marcus June 2022 The best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed! We will be back! Photos don’t donut justice. Perfect setting  perfect view  perfect new pool  homely kitchen with everything you could need plus wonderful outdoor kitchen. Perfect host Julia and her husband have huge hearts and spoilt us. We went for my wife’s birthday and she baked a cake for us. Guided us on where to go  not that we wanted to leave the amazing house and outdoor cooking with beautiful new pool  surrounded by woods and swings and adventure.
11557264,Jennifer June 2022 Julia's villa is absolutely amazing and even greater in real life! Her and her husband are the best hosts we have ever met. They were so welcoming and never failed to surprise us with some Greek treats. Their place truly feels like a home and you discover new things everyday as it is decorated with so much love. Their infinity pool was just finished and it's just perfect to be able to jump in right before having bbq outside on the patio. It's a bit up the hill and you can see the city from up there. Location wise it's also not far from Corfu town and the airport but you could definitely stay in and spend the day at the villa as well.  All in all we had a great time and would recommend this to everyone who wants to experience Corfu in the best way possible.
11557264,Yasir September 2021 Without question the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. You won’t be disappointed.  My wife picked Julia’s place as a last minute break and the whole experience was fantastic. It’s the first time I have felt at home abroad - that sounds like a cliche but it’s true. There’s a lot of love that’s gone into the place and you can feel it in every detail throughout. I just love the structure of the spaces  Clean  spacious  all the amenities including a lovely kitchen and outdoor space  WiFi  comfy sofas  Netflix  the VIEW. What else do you need? At any price  We can’t wait to back. Thank you Julia any George….I really needed it.
11557264,Theo September 2021 Our stay at Xenonerantzia was just perfect. The house is really beautiful  clean and we had everything we need in it. Julia and her family are very kind and made our Hollidays easier by advising and helping us. The house is located not far from beautiful beaches  and there is a small town with supermarket and renting agency at 5min. There is a beautiful view from the house. You won't be disappointed of your trip.
11557264,Marina August 2021 This is an awesome place that will exceed all your expectations! It is very creative  cozy and stylish with the attention to every detail and has all the amenities you can imagine. Real gem not to be missed. Julia and George are super welcoming hosts. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. Please  bear in mind that the car is necessary because there are no spots like supermarket and cafes or so that can be reached by foot.
11557264,Baptistine August 2021 We had a great stay in Corfu thanks to Julia and George. The house is very beautiful and perfect for a family  the view is incredible. We were very well welcomed and Julia and George were very helpful in planning our holiday programme in Corfu with lots of advice. We would recommend this villa 100%. Thank you again!
11557264,Francesca July 2021 The house is perfectly located in the north of the Island with a wonderful seaview. The hosts are very kind and welcoming  the communcation is perfect : they helped us immeditaly when we had a problem and they advised us many beautiful places to go to in Corfu. Also the house is very well decorated  peaceful and very well equiped (even with stuffs for the beach). We had a very pleasant stay and we recommend the place 100% !
11557264,Markus July 2021 We stayed with our two young children (4 and 8) at Julia's and George's house for 10 days towards the end of June and it was fantastic. The villa is conveniently located within a 10 minute drive to the east coast beaches but also within 20 minutes of the west coast with it's other beautiful beaches. Corfu town is also within 20 minutes from the house  so it was just very convenient to get a variety of experiences from this location.  The house itself as described  even better as it comes across the images. The terrace has a beautiful view towards Corfu town and the east coast  which I think comes across better in real life rather than through the pictures  and the house is equipped with everything you need. A place to barbeque  outdoor dining area  grounds to walk on  a lounge area  etc. A beautiful art room attic space for our daughter who loves to draw  an extensive collection of board games and card games for days at home  and multiple terraces  one off of each bedroom. The house is clean  well cared for  and full of character and charm. Julia even provided us with homemade delicacies like moussaka and a fig yogurt dessert which we so enjoyed! And a cake for our arrival. The children each received a sweet gift as well as a farewell. Julia and George are exceptional hosts.  We highly recommend staying at the villa. It was a lovely introduction to Corfu and the charms of island living. Thank you both for the memories! Show more
11557264,Simon July 2017 We had such a lovely time at Julia and George's  the house is very comfortable and the views are incredible  the photos really do not do the place justice. Julia and George are great hosts and we're very helpful  Julia even made a cake for us on our arrival! I cannot recommend Julia and George high enough as hosts and their house is a wonderful and relaxing place to stay.
11557264,Simone August 2016 We were so well in this beautiful and comfortable home that we didn't want to never go away. Julia and her husband George were very hospitable with us. The first night we arrived they made us find the table set with dinner prepared with typical traditional Greek dishes. Julia also prepared for us homemade cookies for tomorrow's breakfast and a chocolate cake. In the fridge they were made us to find fresh milk  a bottle of homemade wine and seasonal fruit. Every morning George brought us two fresh eggs from his hen house that we used to make a delicious eggnog.Thanks to Julia's advices we were able to visit the most beautiful places of Corfu Island.The house was very spacious  organized  hospitable and so beautiful that we taken care of it as if it were our own. From the large window in the living room it was possible to admire an amazing view of the sea. We found peace  silence  and the relax we looked for. To make us pleasant company there were a little dog Nina and Magnus  the cat.We felt at home throughout all our stay.
11557264,Giannis August 2016 Hi guys! Where to start from? We rented this unique villa from 6.8 to 20.8.2016. The first thing i can state is that the reality is by far better than the pictures and what Julia told us in email or on the phone. The view is fantastic and the property is enormous and the facilities are great. BBQ  spacy wooden table in the garden and all u need to feel like home. What to tell about the landlords?? They know how the hospitality should be. They organised painting days for our children cooked for us delicious meals and were very discrete. Thank u again Julia and Giorgo and we are looking forward to visiting u again in the future. Many greetings from Germany.
11557264,Xavier August 2016 Amazing  peaceful and perfect are the words to describe our stay at the house and how Julia and George have been with us from the start to the end. The house itself is very well located and its configuration is just ... perfect. Julia and George themselves actually became the nicest and the more welcoming hosts we've had the chance to meet since we started using Airbnb. Anyone who expects simplicity in a beautiful environment in Corfu island should just go ahead with this choice. We'll come back for sure !
11557264,Guido Paul September 2021 The house is truly wonderful. Spacious  cozy and with attention to detail. The different terraces allow you to enjoy mountains of real relaxation. Unforgettable aperitifs under the porch overlooking the bay. Comfortable and very practical bbq area!! Julia and Georg made us feel truly at home with their warmth. Translated from Italian  Show original
11557264,Lena August 2021 With so much love for detail and coziness  you will very rarely find a house. We felt more than comfortable and really enjoyed the house with two kids. It's just gorgeous: the panoramic view  discovering the small and big things  everything very clean and just beautiful. Avbsolute recommendation. Julia & George are very warm and great hosts. Help wherever they can  bring small delicacies. We will be back! Thank you. Translated from German  Show original
11557264,Marco July 2019 We were a team of 7 guys  we all had a great time as well as for the generous hospitality also for the spectacular view from the house's porch. Very spacious rooms and garden as mentioned above  very large and with an exceptional view. The owner is very helpful and reachable  even very generous  she made us find a nice welcome basket with attached bottles of their wine. I highly recommend this beautiful house  it made our stay in Corfu fabulous!! Translated from Italian  Show original
29281446,Clare October 2022 We loved every minute of our stay and it was so lovely to be back. The villa and it’s incredible view didn’t fail to take our breath away a second time. It is such a comfortable villa and so perfectly positioned to local beaches and delicious tavernas  even in October. The weather was beautiful and we are so grateful to Daphne for another wonderful holiday. Sea Breeze has become very special to us. We’ll be back!
29281446,Georgia September 2022 We had a such a lovely stay here  we booked for 10 days and all instantly fell in love with the place! The location is lovely and views breath taking. The villa was very clean and spacious and we had a fantastic holiday! Thank you for making our trip so special :)
29281446,Anna September 2022 We enjoyed a magical week at the Sea Breeze Villa in Corfu. The villa is located in the best part of Corfu island  and while we drove around the island everywhere else had us wishing we were back at our home. The villa is a 10 min walk down to two beaches - both magical and with great tavernas. It’s a steep walk home but you can jump in the amazing pool that looks over the Ionian Sea to cool off. The villa itself is so warm and inviting. Aircon in all the bedrooms. Three upstairs bedrooms and a very seperate downstairs bedroom and bathroom which makes it great for two groups. Just perfect!
29281446,Sarah July 2022 The house was exactly as per the photos. Absolutely gorgeous. Great location in the north east with incredible views. Walking access to 2 beaches with great tavernas which was ideal. We loved our stay in Corfu because of this amazing property!!
29281446,Lesley June 2022 An amazing home in a stunning location. We had a wonderful break and would definitely recommend the property.
29281446,Stephen May 2022 This villa lived up to expectations. It was peaceful and well appointed. The location is excellent with wonderful views across the sea. The various balconies offered shady lookouts for anyone wanting some time out of the sun. The beach at Kamanaki immediately below the villa is a lovely alternative to the large pool at the house and has 2 tavernas. We ate at the taverna on the beach a couple of times and would highly recommend it. We were a group aged from 2 to 63 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay even with the challenge ( for some !) of the steep steps down to the beach.
29281446,Michael October 2021 The location is stunning with panoramic sea views. The pool was immaculately clean. Beach access down a rather steep but easily accessible private path from the Villa was an added bonus. Sea was remarkably warm enough to swim in comfortably even in late October. Corfu old town and Kassiopi easy journeys and added to our enjoyment.
29281446,Clare October 2021 The villa was perfect  beautifully considered interior and in the most stunning setting with views to take your breath away. Being able to walk down to a small relatively secluded beach was wonderful and the swimming was heavenly even now in October. We rented paddles boards there and small boats just down the road in San Stefano which was great fun. Daphne and her family couldn’t have been more helpful and available for anything we needed and the lovely welcome basket was very gratefully received. We had a really lovely holiday and will definitely return.
29281446,Amr July 2021 Great host  great house  great view
29281446,Christoph June 2021 Wonderful.
29281446,Charles October 2020 We loved staying at this house. It has amazing views and is very comfortable. In late October it was particularly peaceful in this part of Corfu and a joy to be there. There is a charming walk down below the villa to a very nice beach and a particularly welcoming taverna. Daphne  the host  was very welcoming and gave us great restaurant suggestions. Thank you!
29281446,Rachel October 2020 Wonderful stay. Great location with amazing sea views and lovely restaurants a short drive away. Alternatively walk down and visit the great Yiannis for food and drinks on the front.
29281446,Keith October 2020 This villa is simply stunning. A beautiful location with a beautiful panoramic sea view. A 5 minute walk to beaches and tavernas  and a supermarket that can deliver fresh fish and meat every day. The perfect holiday. Daphne was a great host  quick to respond and made sure our stay was perfect. We’ll be back!
29281446,Hollie November 2019 Wow! What an overall amazing stay. Sea Breeze Villa is absolutely beautiful  extremely clean  light and airy. The decor was gorgeous and the fine details all over the villa really made our stay extra enjoyable. The views are absolutely breath taking! We holidayed in late Oct going into Nov and the weather was beautiful still  mid 20s and sunshine almost everyday. We noticed the holiday season had finished  as nearly all the Tavernas were closed but we were more than happy to eat and drink at Sea Breeze and enjoyed sitting on the terrace with the view. There were many local supermarkets close by who source you with fresh meat  veg and bread amongst all your other essentials. We also spent a few days exploring the neighbouring towns like Kassiopi where you could enjoy meal out by the sea too.  The villa suited everyone’s needs especially the needs of the children with us aged 7 & 8. It was private  safe and enclosed. The children LOVED the pool they swam almost all day everyday. There were plenty of pool and pool side toys on offer  we didn’t need to buy anything when here. The sun bathing areas are all perfectly thought out and there’s plenty of little escapes around the villa with the balcony area up stairs and the little sunbathing retreat out from the downstairs bedroom. There’s a hill path leading down to a lovely little stone beach which you can get to in under 10 minutes. The children enjoyed snorkelling in the clear blue sea water.  Daphne was brilliant and on hand to answer any questions and her lovely Mum greeted us at the villa and came to assist when we needed. Thank you both so much for such an amazing stay  we would highly recommend this Villa to all reading this review and we will be telling our friends back home about it. We definitely hope to stay again in the future. It was an all round perfect family holiday. Show more
29281446,Paul October 2019 Sea Breeze villa is as close to idyllic as you can imagine. Breathtaking views from the front and a delightful swimming pool adjacent to the house. Daphne and her mother Nana were attentive hosts and thoughtful of every detail. We will definitely come back.
29281446,Taylor October 2019 If you're looking for a beautiful  comfortable home with gorgeous views and total privacy  book this place! My husband and I spent be first week of October here for our honeymoon. We were so happy with our choice to book this villa  for many reasons.  First of all  the place is gorgeous. The pictures online don't do it justice  especially the thoughtfully-designed outdoor spaces. The view from the little terrace is incredible - every morning  we would have breakfast at the big table and watch the boats crossing the bay while we drank our espresso. The beds were comfortable  and there were plenty of additional amenities - a full kitchen  in-house laundry facilities  a Nespresso machine  complementary toiletries  extra towels  etc.  The villa is located in the cutest town. Nissaki is friendly to visitors without feeling too touristy. While we visited at the end of the season  there were still many restaurants and shops open. The supermarket Aphrodite's just down the road is perfect for grocery shopping. Try their baklava too! We also had several meals at Yianni's Taverna  which is a family-run restaurant on the water  just a 5 minute walk away from the house.  There are two small beaches that can be reached by a private path  with many larger beaches located a short drive away. We recommend visiting Sidari in the north and Kontogialos beach in the west. On the one rainy day of our trip  we visited the historic Theotoky Estate vineyard and had dinner in Corfu Town at the Venetian Well. There's so much to do in Corfu  we wish we could have stayed longer!  Daphne was a great communicator and extremely helpful. She sent us a list of recommendations for local shops and restaurants  and helped us find the villa after our navigator took us to the wrong place. Her mother Nana greeted us at the villa with the sweetest welcome basket with champagne and cookies to celebrate our wedding.  It was an amazing trip  and we were so glad we chose to stay at Sea Breeze. Show more Response from Daphne October 2019 Dear Taylor  I am so glad you really enjoyed your honeymoon in our villa! Thank you so much!  Daphne Show more
29281446,Alice September 2019 What can I say! The villa was absolutely perfect and was the base for a truly incredible and memorable holiday. The view was out of this world  the pool was fabulously refreshing and there was plenty of room inside for us all to feel relaxed and not on top of each other. We were met on arrival by Daphne’s mother who was extremely warm  welcoming and knowledgable and then helped along the way by the very kind lady at Aphrodities supermarket who delivered fresh meat and fish every day to the villa (what a luxury). We will definitely be back and will definitely be visiting Toula’s Restaurant at Agni Beach which was absolutely fabulous!! Thank you Daphne for everything. It was just fantastic.
29281446,Karin September 2019 We had a lovely week at Sea Breeze  the villa was great  very clean and comfortable and the outdoor space  including the pool was perfect. The views are amazing.
29281446,Myrto September 2019 Great house  clean  spacious. Awesome views of the sea and Corfu town. The pool is great and the outside spaces offer excellent opportunities for al-fresco dining or enjoying cocktails. Will love to go back again
29281446,Jonathan September 2019 Great villa  superb location - better than described
29281446,Marie France August 2019 A beautiful place all is perfect
29281446,Lilla August 2019 Blissful views of Corfu bay and wonderful early evening skies. Fantastic hosting in a beautiful family home that is clearly still loved.
29281446,Meshal August 2019 It was a lovely stay at the spacious and beautiful “Sea Breeze” villa. The pool was the perfect size and temperature; definitely refreshing in the hot summer Corfu air. The house was almost entirely air conditioned  perfectly clean  and well-maintained. In addition  Daphne was kind enough to leave us a welcome basket with food and drinks  as well as clean towels and house slippers. Thank you Daphne for the excellent stay  I will definitely recommend this villa to friends and family!
29281446,Michelle June 2019 Sea Breeze Villa was a highlight of our trip. Daphne was prompt and accurate in all communications and her mother  Nana  met us at the property  showed us around  and introduced us to Aphrodite at the local store who delivered our groceries. The Villa itself was fantastic for our party of 8  lots of space for privacy as well as plenty of communal areas to gather together. A short walk down to Kamanaki beach with a great taverna meant that we had no need for a car. We will be recommending this Villa to friends and family and will definitely be back.
29281446,Rob June 2019 Spectacular panoramic views and location. Fabulous swimming pool  with night flood lights. A short 8 minute walk down a private path takes you to Kaminaki Beach  which is small and picturesque with two tavernas. This has been a wonderful home for our family's get together. Everybody loved it and wants return. Thank you Nana and Daphne.
29281446,Rachel June 2019 This is a really beautiful villa in an idyllic area of north east Corfu. The pool was fantastic with amazing views and we all loved the walk down in the morning to kaminaki beach which is stunning and unspoilt. And some lovely extra touches like the mid week clean  flowers  hamper and lovely korres products. Also we loved the area especially kaminaki beach and the coast line north. Highly recommend for families.
29281446,Inga April 2019 The Sea Breeze Villa is a most wonderful location. It‘s designed with love in every detail and has a spetacular view of the sea. It was very clean. We highly recommend it.
29281446,Janina November 2018 What an amazing villa and what a view! Sea Breeze Villa is the most lovely  welcoming home I have ever stayed in. Stunning views over Corfu and the Ionian sea  great outside area and the most wonderful pool. Swimming in both the pool and the sea were daily highlights  as there is a private path from the house leading to two different beaches. There is also a great coastal footpath to Agni and Kalami Bays  which we found so romantic. The villa is beautifully decorated and fully equipped with everything you might need. There was also a welcome basket with tea  coffee  bottled water  bread and even milk  eggs and butter in the fridge and a bottle of wine. Communication with Daphne was great  as she was always responding quickly to all our messages and was available anytime. All in all a romantic  luxurious and memorable stay. Response from Daphne November 2018 Thank you Janina! It was a pleasure to welcome you at our villa!
29281446,Finn-Rasmus October 2022 Staying at Daphne's villa was a nice holiday for us (two couples) at the end of September. Unfortunately  we were not lucky with the weather for the first few days  but that is just because of the season. Otherwise  the location is very nice and quiet. The path to the beach leads over many steps  which was no problem for us. The amenities in the house were also great. From mosquito repellant to cooking utensils (olive oil in the gift basket👍🏻)  everything was available in sufficient quantity. It is recommended to have a rental car with which you can explore the island from the house or simply come from/to the airport in about 45 minutes. The poolguy and the cleaning lady were discreet and came once during our week-long holiday. All in all we highly recommend the place. Translated from German  Show original
29281446,Eva May 2022 The accommodation is a real treat with fantastic views. Very tasty taverns within walking distance right on the beach. It exceeded our expectations! We will be happy to come back. Translated from German  Show original
29281446,Benno September 2020 Villa Sea Breeze is fantastically located and equipped. It didn't work for us. Absolutely clean  even with unobtrusive interim cleaning.

29281446,Emmanuel August 2020 Very nice house with splendid views with olive trees and sea below Located about 40 minutes from Corfu capital  it is on a very beautiful part of the island (pretty coast  elegant and privileged environment) Very complete and outdoor indoor equipment (bbq  many deckchairs) Efficient and valuable air conditioning Access to two beaches below the house via a small path and then stairs (a 5-minute walk) is a real plus to enjoy the sea daily Possibility of renting boats on the beach to discover the coast further north with swimming in the coves The proximity to the road passing over the house is not an issue and does not cause noise pollution Everything is perfect and I highly recommend this villa which is a real balcony overlooking the sea and the perfect place to spend a relaxing holiday Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Brian September 2022 There were two of us and the house was perfect and it would be ok for a young family of four. Stathis was great  very quick to communicate and really flexible with check in. We made good use of the excellent bbq and garden and the terrace outside the main bedroom is a nice place to sit and watch the sun set. Pentati is a lovely quiet village with a fantastic little shop and three small tavernas. All in all highly recommended if you are looking for a peaceful holiday away from the crowds.
18288635,Gad August 2022 Good location to discover the whole island  Stathis is a great host  loved the garden and the view. Very private. Nice touches that they left us ample biscuits and water and moskito spray. A good car is needed to go up the hill.
18288635,Valentina June 2022 Great place for vacation.
18288635,Cristian June 2022 The host is a great person that responded quickly to all our requests. The location itself its fantastic. The position  the garden  the mountain cannot be catch in a few pictures. The house is very clean. Beside the usual kitchen crockery(pots  plates etc) we found a few basic ingredients for you to cook(pasta  oil  eggs  water) which was pleasant surprise for us. You'll need a car to have access to all the beaches in Corfu. Definitely a great place to came back to.

18288635,Barbara October 2021 The house is located in a nice little village not far from the sea  from the terrace with a wonderful view of the sea and the coast. The house is big enough for 4 people. The terrace is oriented to the north  which is definitely an advantage in summer. The house is in an ideal location for excursions to the island and is located in one of the most beautiful stretches of coast. A place for a relaxing vacation.
18288635,Yann Et Gaella September 2021 Stathis and his wife are the best hosts you can have! thanks again for everything! Yann and Gaëlla
18288635,Ciprian Edmond August 2021 Location is great with a beautiful view! A bit hard to get there without a car but the experience is an amazing one if you gonna choose this place!House is fully equipped with everything what u need if u want to cook some food also a bbq place can be found in the garden!Pentati is a village and that’s why prices are so good for a house of this size! 2 local Taverns are 2-3 minutes far away from from the house ( food is a local one and is really tasty also the wine is really good) prices good too Agios Gordios is a beach next to the house (7-8 minutes drive) and there u can find a super market and loads of taverns and places where u can eat and drink.The beach is a sandy one with beautiful weather but small stones are in the water 1-2m after that is Sandy and nice!  The owner is a really nice and kind person who gonna try everything to help you if u need! For me and my family was a nice experience so yeah I’ll highly recommend this place
18288635,Erich June 2021 Nothing else can better describe the place as my previous review from last September. As I wrote already  we will come back to this place anytime we want to visit Corfu Island. Big thanks to Stathis for sharing his beatiful home. Erich and Felen
18288635,Jan October 2020 Stathis is a very responsive and nice host. Apartment ja very well located at the west coast on a hill but in a quiet area with an fantastic view on the sea. We recommend a car for this apartment. The garden is lovely with nice hang out areas. The kitchen provides everything you need to cook! The internet is a bit weak if you use it with 5 persons. All in all totally recommendable to relax on and explore Corfu. Good value for money!
18288635,Erich September 2020 Very nice house in a beautiful quiet and small village of Pentati with complete privacy. The views from the house are gorgeous and the house has everything what you need for couples or for a family with 2 kids. The house looks even better than on the pictures  although the road to the village is a little bit tricky. Definitely you need a car  so you can explore the island and the beaches around. There are 2 great tavernas in walking distance and also a small mini market with basic supplies. Stathis was a very nice a generous host  he let us check-in earlier and also check-out very late. We really highly recommend this place and in case we come back to Corfu  we will come back for sure. Thanks very much Stathis
18288635,Renata September 2020 Wonderful two-story house overlooking the Agios Gordios Bay. There's nothing like waking up in the morning and having a coffee in the garden and watching the sea. Perfect point of access to the beaches on the western coast of Corfu. A car is highly recommended. Stathis and his wife are very kind and hospitable people! Thank you very much for our pleasant stay in Pentati
18288635,Mario August 2020 The house is authentic but well equipped and clean and Sthatis is a very nice host.
18288635,Gabrielė August 2020 Stahis place is really amazing. Located in authentic little village with wonderful views. The place itself has everything you could possibly need - from coffee maker to washing machine. Kitchen is very well equipped  you can make your own delicious meals from fresh local produce. But the best part is the wonderful owners Stahis and Ula  who not only made us welcome with homemade pies  but also provided us with a baby chair and crib and even helped us arrange boat tours. The holiday at Stathis' was a dream come true.
18288635,Dina August 2020 The best views of the island from this property!! The gardens are stunning  you can see that the hosts put a lot of love and work into them. Maybe not the most suitable for families with toddlers as the views are thanks to the house being perched on a cliff amd the garden is not completely fenced off. Entirely safe with constant adult supervision though.
18288635,Iulian September 2019 The house looks better than the pictures.
18288635,Florence July 2019 We recommend this house for people traveling by car. The view is amazing. The hosts are very great. The house is spacious and has a beautiful garden.
18288635,Tiziana September 2018 Mr Stathis is a wonderful host. Very precise  very reliable  very warm and generous. It was easy to deal with him before and during our stay in his home in Pentati  on the west coast of Corfu. The description of the house and the pictures are perfectly corresponding to the reality. Mr Stathis and his wife have a beautiful house with an amazing garden full of orange and lemon trees and a stunning view upon the coast and the sea. The house is fully equipped and incredibly clean. Mr Stathis and his wife came during the week and cleaned the house and changed the bed linens and the towels. They also left for us a delicious home made cake. The small village of Pentati is a little bit isolated on the mountain but very peaceful and relaxing  perfect if you are looking for rest. The next village on the coast  Agios Gordis is a very touristic spot but in this time of the year  i.e. end of September  pleasant with some good tavernas and a beautiful  long sandy beach  the water is very clean. In general Corfu is probably very crowded in summer but very relaxing in the other months. In Pentati you have probably always the best conditions for restful and Relaxing holidays. We would recommend Mr Stathis house to anyone who loves nature  peace and relaxing surroundings. Also families with children will enjoy to stay here. Show more
18288635,Kremena August 2018 Stathis was helpful and provided fast response. The house is very nice with beautiful view. Perfect for 2 couples but there is one additional room on the 1st floor with a single bed. Stathis added for us an additional foldable bed as we were 3 couples.  Don’t miss to go to Sofia’s restaurant 100 meters from the house. Very nice Greek kitchen  big portions and cheap.  Quiet place and perfect for family with kids.  Fully equipped with washing machine and to cook. There is also a barbecue.
18288635,Jędrzej July 2018 Wonderful expierience  far away from crowds  stunning view.. Stathis is a perfect host!
18288635,Leen June 2018 As a family of 5 with 3 adult children we really enjoyed our one week stay in the house of Stathis in the village Pentati. The house was clean and in perfect state. The view from the garden is amazing  and the garden itself is very beautiful as well.
18288635,Maciej April 2018 Very nice
18288635,Elisabeth April 2018 Our stay at Stathis’ house was beyond our expectations: the house is very comfortable for our family of 4  it was incredibly clean  everything we needed was present - they even bought a new baby bed for our youngest son so we wouldn’t have to bring ours on the plane! We were welcomed with a basket with chocolate  red vases and eggs for traditional easter celebrations  which was a very kind touch. Stathis and his wife explained all the details about our stay  and they were easy to communicate with during the week we were at their house. Of course the view deserves to be mentioned  it is spectacular to have breakfast in the morning or an glass of wine in the evening while overlooking the bay - awesome! We went to Corfu a few times for the easter festivities  which is only half an our away. Also the beautiful beach of Agios Gordios is really easy to reach. We’ll definitely come back!!
18288635,Evgeny September 2017 It was unforgettable experience. The house of Sthatis is very comfortable and cozy. It has everything you need including washing machine and hairdryer. There's a gorgeous seaview with olive and orange trees around the house. Grocery shops and several nice restaurants are in a walking distance. Sthatis was very nice and hospitable  we really recommend his place.
18288635,Clemens August 2017 I highly recommend this comfortable house in the small village of Pentati. It is located away from the busy tourist centers  higher in the mountains but with a great sea view from the main terrace. Still  it is located close enough to good swimming locations. The house is surrounded by gardens with abundant flowers and several fruit trees. The village itself has two tavernas and a minimarket. Stathis and his wife gave us a warm welcome  complete with wine and home-baked cake. Small queries and issues were resolved swiftly and without ado. Response from Ευσταθιος September 2017 Mr Clemens and Sophie Thank you very much for your good words.I hope to see you again in the future. Be well Stathis Show more
18288635,Masha July 2017 Pentati is a quiet small village with two taverna and one market.Doesn't have it's own beach.The nearest beach is on 5-10 minutes with car  so you must have a car or other vehicle. The house is very nice with an amazing sea view and big garden for true relaxation and enjoyment with beautifull flowers and lemon tree   so you can make your homemade lemonade :) the backyard is perfect for barbecue and dinner in nature . it's on a good location  if you don't like other tourists to step on your fot :) peacefull place  far away from noise. The house inside is nice clean and comfortable.Contains some things that belong to the owner  such as souvenirs on the shelves  dolls  clothes in some part of the closet. the kitchen is fully equipped. The bathroom upstairs is big and nice. the toilet downstairs is useful. each room has it's own balcony with table and chairs  so everyone can have their one privacy. Every fourth day is cleaned  and changed bedding and towels. the hosts- Stathis and his wife were so lovely and really made us feel at home. they come every two day to water the garden  so if you have any question or problem  you can solve it immediatly with them. They are so sweet   that they even prepared us a suprise cake   olives and tradicional drinks ! we would thoroughly recommend this property to anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay . it really made our trip to Corfu a memory we will never forget.We want to come again ! the most important of all is that are dog enjoy everything with us as well :) Show more Response from Ευσταθιος August 2017 Dear Masha Thank you very much for the good words for me and my house.

18288635,Maria Mercedes August 2022 Stathis welcomed us to his beautiful house that has a wonderful view  better than what you see in the photos. The house is very equipped. Perfect cleaning. The only difficulty we found is the road that leads to the house  we recommend a high car to move around without difficulty. Thank you Stathis Translated from Italian  Show original
18288635,Haiden August 2022 The house matches the pictures. We stayed there with 2 adults and 3 children (8 to 13 years). The house is just big enough. 2 of the 3 bedrooms have air conditioning. The nearest beach can be reached on foot if necessary  but it is a steep climb/descent to it + the beach is very small and rocky. We kept going to beaches down the road by car. By the way  a car is advisable for a stay in this house. Translated from Dutch  Show original
18288635,Anne-Lise July 2022 Beautiful house with beautiful views and a beautiful garden. Sthatis is very attentive. The house is well equipped. We had a lovely stay. A good taverna 100 m away. The only downside: the road is beautiful but rugged. Translated from French  Show original

Unforgettable stay! Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Tobias May 2022 Super views over the entire bay from Agios Gordios to Glyfada and an impressive sunset! The house was spotlessly clean  fully equipped and the hosts were very polite and warm. Each bedroom has its own balcony with table and chairs. The garden is large and there is a swing  hammock  barbecue and a total of 3 terraces. Convenient was the washing machine. The village of Pentati is beautiful and within walking distance is a great tavern called Chris Place just around the corner. We will be back! Translated from German  Show original
18288635,Leila September 2021 The welcome is the kindness of Stathis lives up to the beauty of the house ! The outdoor space is beautiful and very well maintained.

18288635,Wolfgang October 2019 Everything was as described  ok the parasol in the garden has had its best time  but we didn't need it. The house is very large  everything you could ever need is there for beautiful vacation days. The viewpoints from the garden to the balcony were particularly good:-). The taverna around the corner beckons with perfect views and good food. This was a nice vacation and we will be happy to come back. Gabi& Wolfgang Translated from German  Show original
18288635,Charlotte August 2019 Very pleasant stay in a place outside the hordes of tourists  in rural area to the sound of the rooster and nearby dogs. Beautiful view  very easy swimming around the rocks   within a 10-minute walk. The thirsty climb. 2 nice little tavernas next door. A car is essential on the premises. The house is very well equipped. Lots of wasps and hornets  but if they burn Greek coffee  they're less embarrassing when they eat. Very relaxing stay. Decent bedding for 5  mattress on the floor for the 6th. Cleaning was done with a change of sheets and towels after 3 days and we had the good surprise of finding a delicious cake when we came back. Thanks to Sthatis. If we can  we'll be back Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Karine August 2019 House with beautiful sea views and sunset. Well equipped and clean. Very good restaurant nearby. An excellent welcome from Stathis who is very responsive and attentive. Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Aurelie August 2019 Beautiful  well-equipped house with exceptional views of the coast. The garden is beautiful and allows you to enjoy evenings or breakfast outside. We were very well received in person by the owners. You can reach Agios Georgios beach in 10 minutes by car and shine on the rest of the coast easily. Essential car. The village is very friendly and we highly recommend the 1st restaurant: delicious and very affordable. A wonderful stay! Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Péter June 2019 We spent a week here. The view of the sea is amazing  we always had breakfast in the courtyard. We got fruit at check-in and then a homemade cake. Stathis has given me an idea of when and for what he will be arriving. Translated from Hungarian  Show original
18288635,Paul June 2019 We enjoyed the beautiful location and home. We were warmly welcomed and we lacked nothing during the stay. There was also a swimming pool ready for our daughter later and a thoughtful touch on the table for us after each cleaning. The house has everything you need. You can have a carefree vacation there. We keep a beautiful memory. Tip: Nice to do a time is a hike along the mountain to the beach. You'll be there in less than an hour. Just bring good shoes. For the rest  take a car during the stay. Translated from Dutch  Show original
18288635,Guiet April 2019 The welcome is very warm and the host is very available if needed. The house is as described  extremely clean and the sheets and towels changed once in the cleaning week have also been redone. The view is exceptional and the garden amenities allow you to enjoy it. The village is typical with its two tavernas with different charm and quality. Being 20 minutes from Corfu is very good in April  it's a superb city. Pentati stayed authentic unlike Aghios Gardios 3km away. The village's small port is lovely and walking to Aghios Gardios is a must. The island is perfect in April. Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Julia September 2018 We ( 2 adults and 2 small children) spent 2 wonderful weeks (early to mid-September) with Stathis and his wife. We arrived at the house in the dark in the evening and were warmly welcomed with homemade sandwiches and fruit. The house and garden is as described. Everything worked out! Since we have two small children  it is important to us to be suitable for infants to spend a relaxing vacation. Stathis has provided a cot and high chair for our 1.5 year old. There was nothing missing. Both are incredible children's lovers! The stairs in the house are a 180-degree staircase in a narrow space. You have to be careful with young children  it's not so easy to walk on. The garden is very nice. There is a children's swing and toys available. Stathis brought us additional bathing toys for the sea  a spray gun and a paddling pool! However  the garden is not entirely safe for toddlers. There are a few steep stone steps etc so you can't let them run around unattended. As is common in Corfu  there are many wasps in September. The house has nets at every window  so the animals cannot enter the house. Stathis and his wife are very warm hosts and we highly recommend them! Show more Translated from German  Show original
18288635,"Tino September 2018 We stayed in this beautiful place for two weeks in August. We didn't miss anything  but you should rent a car for all errands. The best place to shop is at Lidl in Corfu town. You can also get small things in the village itself. The small fishing beach  which is about 15 minutes away on foot  is a real secret tip  especially in the morning hours  it is wonderfully beautiful here. We took a taxi to the accommodation and paid €60  which was unfortunately too much. Tip: ""make a deal before"". Stathis and his wife have been very great hosts. I would always recommend it.

18288635,Nicolas July 2018 A well-equipped villa in a pretty village  with a splendid view Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Jan June 2018 It was great. That's all you need to know. Host Stathis was extremely nice and helpful. The house was exactly as described  the view blew us away every day for 14 days. You can hear the surf throughout the house (outside anyway) (if there are waves). Around it is a lot of nature  the garden is large and the beds comfortable (is of course always a matter of taste). If we come to Corfu again  then we will definitely stop at Stathis again! Translated from German  Show original
18288635,"Judith October 2017 The house of Stathis and his wife is located in a small  sleepy mountain village with beautiful views of the bay of Agios Gordios. Half an hour from the airport by car (taxi price 45 euros). We (couple from Hanover) still had beautiful summer weather (23 degrees) in October. The island of Corfu is incredibly green. The west coast is very beautiful and often has great views of the bays. The serpentine roads are all surrounded by beautiful  old olive trees  very nice driving routes.  The village of Pentati itself has only one mini market and two taverns (""Angela"" and ""Sofia""). If you are looking for peace and relaxation  this is the place to be. However  it is mandatory to have a set of wheels. We had rented a scooter (125 euros for 10 days). Makis  the owner of the tavern Angela  helped us mediate. Make sure to eat there  it's super delicious. You look into the pots and you can choose what you want.  Stathis' house is typically furnished in the country. Simple  clean and with everything you need. Two separate bedrooms with air conditioning and 1x mosquito net  guest toilet  bathroom with bathtub (hot water)  washing machine  kitchen with gas stove (spices available). Small conservatory. Radio and CD player  WiFi runs great. We did not use TV. Parking available. Great balcony with amazing views.  Stathis and his wife live in the house if it is not rented out. During the rental period they live in Corfu city  but come every four days for 1.5 hours to clean the house. Both are making great efforts and are always available for questions and other concerns by email or phone.  In the garden  where you will find mandarins  lemons and herbs to pick yourself in addition to flowers  there is a great barbecue for barbecue or to make a fire. We've made great use of it. In the evenings there were cute cats who brought you company.  Pentati Beach (pebble beach  anglers) can be reached on foot in 10 minutes via a footpath. By scooter you can also reach the bay of Agios Gordios (sandy beach) in 10 minutes. Here it is touristy. Many restaurants  bars and shops can be found here. Here  food is a bit more expensive  it is better to drive to nearby Agios Matteos to ""Coop"". They serve fresh meat  too.  We only missed a sun lounger in the garden. The Hollywood swing and the hammock shown in the pictures no longer exist.  Tip: Sinarades and Kato Garouna are cute and still very original villages. Issos beach in the south is a great stretch of beach  recommended. Corfu city is a must  anyway  pretty town. Show more Translated from German  Show original"
18288635,Stéphane August 2017 A very nice house at the entrance of a small village in the mountains  with a magnificent sea and bay view (the sea is a 10-15 minute drive) and a beautiful flowery garden (with many lemon trees!). However  be careful of the wasps and hornets in the area... Stathis and his wife are very welcoming  available and areange. Translated from French  Show original
18288635,Marco August 2017 The house is very nice  well kept and clean. It is immersed in a spacious garden that Stathis takes great care of  where there is a bbq  a hammock and the coffee table for breakfast and dinner. Agios Gordios is a 5-minute drive  a resort with beautiful beach and sea  30 minutes away from kerkyra  but for all other locations you have to drive from 40 to 80 minutes on the road. Stathis and his wife turned out to be great people  and in the middle of the week they even changed all of our linens. Overall  my friends and I had a great time and we can only recommend the house to take a vacation in Corfu less blasoned but definitely more authentic and characteristic.

4361241,Sylvie October 2022 Beautiful house  exactly as described.
4361241,Alan September 2022 There are not many places that you can truly say were outstanding  but this is definitely one of them! We definitely want to come back again to see Vasso and stay in her wonderful cottage.
4361241,Margie July 2022 Riza’s Stone Cottage is one of the most beautiful places we have ever stayed in - it is everything it says in the description. In fact it does not do this glorious place justice. Vasso is a delightful host - so helpful and gracious. We can’t wait to return!
4361241,Balazs July 2022 We really loved to stay in Vasso’s house. It has very positive vibes with a lovely garden. It is the perfect base for discovering Corfu.
4361241,Teresa June 2018 We had a very good time at Vassos nice house in Corfu. Vasso is a very nice host  she is helpful and knows where the good spots are in Corfu. The house is nice and spacious with two bedrooms. The garden is really beautiful with lots of shadow (end of May). A car is helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and can clearly recommend this!
19866203,Alejandro August 2022 Fantastic  private and tranquil place. Highly recommended.
19866203,Pablo August 2022 A very nice rustic house. The location is perfect  in a very quiet environment  and very close to the capital  where you can find everything. It is also in the center of the island  which is a perfect location to reach any place on the island. The pool is perfect. Very clean  very adequate size and perfect temperature. The rooms are simple  but sufficient. To highlight the friendliness of the hosts. Extremely attentive and very helpful for everything. In short  highly recommended to spend a few days with the family on the wonderful island of Corfu.
19866203,Row July 2022 This is a lovely cottage in a quite rural location so best to have a car. The local town has shops  bars  restaurants and there is a supermarket - all about 2k away. We walked to Ipsos - 7.5k - a lovely walk if you are feeling energetic. House had all you need though a little tired in parts. Hosts were lovely and very helpful with car hire  taxi etc. Lovely gardens and pool area.
19866203,Steve July 2022 Our stay at Mimosa Pool Cottage in July 2022 was utterly delightful.  The accommodation was as advertised  but exceeded expectations. The cottage was generous in size  with two double bedrooms and additional sleeping space on a fold-out sofa.  Air-con was available within the kitchen-dining room  and portable fans were provided in the bedrooms.  The pool was 20 yards from the cottage  and was the perfect size and temperature.  Upon arrival  everything was spotlessly clean  and Alice (the host) was there to meet & greet us. Alice’s welcome was very hospitable and she showed us around the accommodation  providing lots of information and insight.  Communication with Alice throughout our stay was predominantly via WhatsApp  which was perfect for us. Alice lives on site in another villa  and responded to texts promptly  but also gave us space to enjoy the cottage and surrounding garden & pool on our own. At no point did we feel crowded; quite the reverse - Alice was a true 'super host'  helping when needed  and providing privacy at all other times.  An example of Alice's reassuring presence was when we borrowed two bicycles to cycle into the local village. There were initially no locks for the bikes  but after texting Alice  some brand new locks were left outside the cottage 15 minutes later  after her husband had driven off to the local supermarket to buy some.  The accommodation is a 5 minute drive (or 30 minute walk) along a quiet road  to the local town of Gouvia  where there are bars & restaurants  a supermarket  plus a bus stop which takes you into Corfu town (20 minute bus ride).  Gouvia also has a beach with motor boat hire and pleasure cruise trips departing.  All in all  this was a fantastic place to stay which we would highly recommend. We look forward to returning in the near future for another holiday on the beautiful island of Corfu.  Thank you for everything Alice ❤️. Show more
19866203,Chad July 2021 Alice and her home were both lovely. Communication was great  and Alice quickly answered all our questions. She was also able to handle our midnight check-in.

19866203,Ryan September 2020 We loved our stay  great pool  huge grounds  warm reception from the host and everything we needed was there. Easy drive to anywhere on the island  and plenty of great food and amenities in Gouvua itself. Highly recommend
19866203,Alice August 2020 We had a wonderful stay in Mimosa Garden Villas. It is located in a very quiet and private area and the pool is the perfect place to relax.

19866203,Richard August 2018 Hi Alice & Family   We can't thank you enough. We had a brilliant time staying at the pool cottage  it is a holiday that we will remember fondly for ever. The facilities were excellent and your local knowledge was very accurate and useful for first time visitors to Corfu. Our boys LOVED every minute (as did we)  especially the excellent pool!  The villa is in a great location for exploring the beautiful island. It takes roughly a maximum 50 mins to reach the beautiful beaches and coves of North of the island  1 hour to reach the stunning Lake Korission in the South West  20 mins to Corfu town and Paleokastritsa. Its a 5 min drive to the local shop and a 5 second walk to the stunning pool! We visited during the busy season in August but discovered that there are plenty of amazing places to visit that aren't crowded. With the peaceful and friendly retreat at Mimosa Garden Villas  it really was a perfect family holiday for us.  All the best  Rick  Lorna  Vincent & Oscar Show more

A shopping center to feed 3 minutes away   convenient   15 minutes from the Aqualand (refurbished and excellent !!!) and an hour max from the love canal and other beautiful beaches in the north of the island . The pool is an asset after the big days of walking and if you don't have an outdoor space in your own home   here you will be delighted : Olive trees  multiple trees  cicadas   deckchairs  swimming pool ... Quiet +++  The biggest negative point is the bedding which is very bad . We smell the springs from the mattresses   we had a bad back and the sleep was not the best   I can only suggest changing the mattresses of all the beds . In addition  we needed more condiments and useful equipment  we were missing pepper   spices   oil in greater quantity  vinegar   one more towel. A functional coffee machine with coffee in pods  practical   several tastes of teas ... The shower leaves something to be desired. Some suggestions were made to Alice .  I would say that for the price paid   and in relation to other listings   it lacks comfort and some improvements would be welcome. Show more Translated from French  Show original

21558256,Bryony June 2022 Wonderful holiday here. Perfect location  close to the beach. Only things to note are the lack of ‘extras’ provided. Not a complaint at all  but worth knowing you need to buy toilet roll/hand soap. Would definitely go back!

21558256,Tom June 2022 Great location  can easily be accessed by the buses  however the host could’ve provided more information on the routes and how to get to other places by bus.

21558256,"Sofia June 2022 Despite that we had a wonderful vacation  I should say that the living conditions were the worse I’ve experienced via Airbnb. No doubts  the view is incredible  but: - cheap plastic furniture outside is awful - the umbrella is in bad condition with tape all around - no hot water  BUT the host fixed it in 24h - the shower is very uncomfortable to use  water all around - after the hot water was fixed  our apartment was all wet and dirty - no soap  we bought it ourselves - kitchen: the toaster is old and stinky  the knifes could barely cut the banana  they are bad! And so on. We were travelling with car all the time so we liked the island  but if we needed to stay around the apartments  it would be awful vacation. And again: If all those things will be fixed it would be a wonderful place to stay. The view is amazing. Private terrace. Around: British tourists  so the restaurants around are expensive BUT you should visit the amaizing Dimitrius taverna above the village Kalami. Show more Response from Sofronios June 2022 Dear Sofia   Hello from Eos.  I have read carefully your points of view concerning the property that we manage and thank you very much for your time to review.  I found your comments totally unfair about the property and suspicious  in terms of the reasonable question: ""How can someone spend a holiday in a property with so many issues  for 4 whole days (the excuse of traveling around during the day can not stand for common-sense reasons) and he did not ask the managing company or the caretaker to assist and move him into another property or to compensate him for the unacceptable condition of the house that he had paid for""?  I have carefully checked your file and our contacts  but I could nowhere find any complaints or requests on your behalf (except the boiler's issue which was attended to immediately) since the day of your arrival in the resort.  The result of my investigation - on its own - is creating a lot of questions for us all and for our Consultants Team  which now needs to check your comments further.  This given  I am not intended trying to refute your allegations  but I reserve all the rights of my Company to proceed further if needed.  Kind regards  The Eos Team Show more"

21558256,Daniel September 2020 Sofronios was there for our arrival amd ordered plenty of hints and tips for the locality. As for the studio. It a stoes throw from the beach. You can sit at the front and enjoy the view. Its basic  but includes Air Con  great hot shower and big beds. It is one of the least expensive studios in Kalami  so  if you are on a budget and want a piece of wonderful Kakami I say give it a try. You will spend a lot more and end up doing a lot of walking to get home. Enjoy. Response from Sofronios September 2020 Dear Daniel Hello from Eos Villas. Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

When I was there (May 2021)  I was the only tourist in the village and everything was calm and peaceful. The house is very close to the main road to Kassiopi  I could imagine it so not that calm at peak season. The owner of the house were extremely helpful and welcomed me with a dinner as the supermarket was already closed. You do not need a car there  but it is certainly helpful to do the shopping on the way to the house  there are several big supermarkets on the way to the North.

8561628,Bethan September 2020 We had an amazing time here. The view from the villa over the sea is unbelievable. Very private outdoor space with its own pool  bbq and patio. We loved the location  there is a supermarket and some tavernas near by and only a 5 minute walk to the beach. The owners of the property were so kind and helpful  we would definitely recommend staying here. Thanks for having us!! Response from Sofronios September 2020 Dear Bethan   Hello from Eos Villas.

8561628,Kate September 2018 Villa Theodora is in a lovely location  with easy access to a small beach  a couple of supermarkets and a few tavernas. The accommodation is well-equipped  spacious and clean  with amazing views and a nice pool. We had a great time and would definitely come back.  As our flight arrived late  a small welcome basket of basic provisions would have been much appreciated. Response from Sofronios September 2018 Dear Kate   Hello from Eos.

8561628,Geoff October 2017 Superb apartment with stunning views. Great value for money and was super clean. Only drawback was that no toilet paper or kitchen cleaning utensils were provided. Other than that  top notch. Response from Sofronios October 2017 Dear Geoff   Hello from Eos.  Thanks very much for your positive feedback and for your time to review our property villa Theodora.  It is always very encouraging for our staff and owners to get such nice comments  because these are the ones making our effort worthwhile.  Furthermore  I am sure that my colleagues had also enjoyed dealing with your needs as much as you enjoyed your recent holiday and they will be delighted having again the chance to welcome you back in one of the properties we are looking after.  Until then  I wish you a wonderful time and all the best.  Kindest regards  The Eos Team  Show more
8561628,Philippe April 2017 We have stayed first week of April in Theodora villa. We would recommend to go a little later in the year for the weather can be a little unstable at this time. But the advantage is that there is very few tourists in the island. The villa itself is very well tended and cared for. Everything is as described. The view on the Corfu bay is splendid. The close by supermarket is very useful. It is close also to the bus stop to reach Corfu if one has no car. If interested by diving  we strongly recommend Nissaki Appolo dive centre for beginners or advanced divers  for leisure or PADI training. Response from Sofronios April 2017 Dear Philippe   I appreciate your positive feedback about our property and thanks very much for your time to review.  We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can.  If you're travelling to our area another time  do not hesitate to contact us and we are sure we will find you again the best solution for your needs.  Until then  I wish you a wonderful time and all the best.  With kindest regards  The Eos Team  Show more
8561628,Laurence August 2021 The view is breathtaking and the pool very nice.  On the first day we were supposed to arrive at 2pm but we were asked to wait for a message that the house was ready. At 4 p.m.  still no message  we'll still go there and find the door closed. We call the indicated number but nobody knows Villa Theodora. We send a message asking for the parking code but nobody answers us. We ended up finding an employee who had the key. No hosting ! The house is to be completely renovated  everything is old-fashioned. During the whole stay  nobody came to see us when obviously the whole family lives on the site. But someone would fit in the house as soon as we left by car. It's very unpleasant. The beds are so hard it's hard to sleep there. The noise from the road below is very annoying and the roosters sing from 5am. Not any welcome  no soap  shampoo  laundry. Two half rolls of toilet paper. Absolutely nothing in the kitchen or bathroom. We'll send you to the supermarket below which is run by the villa owner! The common areas are not air-conditioned  it has unbearable heat. The bedrooms are with air conditioners leaking and running on the terrace. This is unacceptable. As our flight is at midnight  we requested to stay later. The villa was not rented again until 3 days after but we were asked to pay. We always didn't see anyone checking out and had to leave the money at the supermarket. Compared to the kindness of the Greeks everywhere else on the island  it is a huge disappointment. Show more Translated from French  Show original
8561628,Tobias October 2020 The villa is very nice and captivates above all by the great view from the terrace to the sea. The villa is sufficiently large and was very clean. The pool area is very nicely designed. The kitchen is somewhat poorly stocked  but you have everything you need. The beds were very hard and behind the house lives a tap that crows very loudly early in the morning  which did not bother us very much. All in all  it was a very successful vacation and we would love to come back. Translated from German  Show original Response from Sofronios October 2020 Dear Tobias  Hello from Eos Villas.

37543437,Georgie October 2022 A great place to stay - we highly recommend!
37543437,Dawn September 2022 Perfect relaxing home  away from the hustle and bustle. Very comfortable and high standard.
37543437,Felicity September 2022 The cottage is a beautiful little air bnb  would recommend a car otherwise it’s up a big hill and to make the most of the area and beaches you need to drive. The cottage was very clean and had everything you might need and check in was very easy. You won’t regret staying here! Happy holidays!
37543437,Zoe September 2022 Was a beautiful place to stay inside and out. Exactly as it looks in the photos but better. The view is lovely and it is a great place to stay if you plan to spend a bit of time there cooking and relaxing. Jeorge is really friendly and helpful. Something useful to know if that the hill to get up is very steep and quite long so very sweaty and tiring and maybe better if you are driving about (plus the area is better to explore by car anyway). Best to be a confident manual driver as there is a lot of hilly and steep roads. Response from Joerg September 2022 Very useful piece of information. We will buy a drying rack and oven gloves right away for the next guets. As for the ants: the cottage is pretty much in the middle of mother nature  we can’t really avoid them…  Thank’s for the positive feedback :-) Show more
37543437,Mara August 2022 Joerg‘s place is just fantastic  my boyfreind and I stayed there for one week in August and had a wonderful time. It is cozy and very relaxing. There is planty of space for two people and it is very clean and welcoming. A lot of beaches are near by and some good Tavernas too. We definitely recommend to use a car  the roads are a little bit bumpy but all in all they were fine. We will for sure return! :D
37543437,Eloise August 2022 This was my first holiday abroad with my friend and I can definitely say jörg and Monica made it one to remember! When we arrived the house was immaculate and we were greeted by Maria who showed us around and made sure we knew where everything was. As we were not planning on hiring a car jörg showed us around all the local places that we would be able to walk to. If you don’t mind some walking and only going to a few beaches/restaurants it’s deffinately possible to stay here without a car just be prepared for hills! We ended up going to one secluded beach quite a-lot which was about a 10 min walk. Jörg recommend vitamins restaurant to us which was also about a 10 min walk  would definitely recommend lovely staff and food. Massive thank you to jörg  Monica and for Maria for making our stay so lovely  would love to come back again!
37543437,James July 2022 We had a really fantastic stay at Joerg’s villa. It’s in a stunning location  with amazing views and gorgeous patio area. The house was beautiful  very clean  with everything we needed. Maria  their housekeeper  met us on arrival and showed us around which was great and really helpful. The house also had air-con in both rooms  a really lovely bathroom with a great shower and lovely dining areas inside and out. We would definitely recommend this stay  thanks again Joerg and Maria!
37543437,Karlee May 2022 We absolutely loved our stay. Joerg’s place was perfect for us. It’s extremely clean and very private and quiet. The terrace is the perfect place to relax  with plenty of trees providing shade. Joerg was really kind and offered to buy a baby bed for our baby. Highly recommend place for your trip to Corfu!
37543437,Sergei October 2021 I couldn’t be happier with my stay: responsive and accommodating host  kind and attentive housekeeper  perfect location and amazing views. Cottage was well equipped and so comfortable. I did not want to leave. Will definitely visit again.
37543437,Graham September 2021 This is an incredibly well-appointed villa in a great location with a fantastic view. It felt like luxury from the first minute to the last.
37543437,Nicole September 2021 Beautiful  super clean and comfortable place. We loved the location  it was exactly what we were looking for. Great advice received on a couple of beaches that we visited daily. Communication was excellent.
37543437,Leah September 2021 This is a wonderful cottage in an amazing location  The place was spotless and well equipped  Joerg was a terrific host  The local beaches and restaurants were lovely  I recommend renting a motor boat for the day at Nissaki beach  Way better than driving
37543437,Iancu August 2021 we had a great vacation in this house. very quiet place  up on the hill  great for relaxing and enjoying a nice view.
37543437,Gavin July 2021 Great communication and help from the host from the moment I made the booking  offering help at every point in travelling to Corfu.  The house itself is built to a high standard and is attractively decorated. The shower delivers hot water instantly. It is double-glazed  meaning it is very quiet and the temperature stays cool for a long time after the aircon is switched off - great for sleeping. The beds are incredibly comfortable. The view is spectacular. A lovely mountain retreat minutes from some of the best beaches. Response from Joerg August 2021 Hi Gavin   thank you very much for the helpful comments concerning your stay. As a matter of fact  nobody missed anyhing in the kitchen so far. The reason is  that most people used it like a hotel room and got out for lunch and dinner. For guests using the cottage as a place to stay and work (like you did)  I have to upgrade the equipment. If you should ever come back in future times  you'll find everything you need :-) Cheers  Joerg Show more
37543437,Jakob July 2021 Jörg's place truely is a little paradise. Centrally located in Nissaki  but at the same time quiet. The house is tastefully decorated and provides for a beautiful terrace overlooking the bay. Plenty tavernas  boat rental in Nissaki Harbour and hiking the Pantokrator - all in the area. Overall: simply perfect.
37543437,Julian July 2021 We had a wonderful time at Jorg’s apartment! It’s a great place  especially the amazing terrace with a perfect view! Very high standard and located off the beaten tourist tracks of the main town and road. Still quick to get to great beaches and restaurants/shops. Anastasia (she looks after the apartment) is very easy going and helpful with good tips. Can absolutely recommend!
37543437,Melissa June 2021 A beautiful  peaceful and spotless house with incredible views and outdoor space. Perfect communication and check in/out. Highly recommended.
37543437,Stéffèn October 2020 Beautiful cozy cottage with a really nice view. The communication with Anastasia and Joerg was very good. Just some kitchen utensils are missing to cook by yourself.
37543437,Jad August 2020 Joerg’s place is absolutely stunning - a true gem!! Beautiful house  very tasteful furnishings  fresh flowers and a bottle of local wine on arrival and  best of all  the most stunning view from the patio. We were greeted by Anastasia who was very lovely and welcoming. The house was just superb and made our trip so special. The only comment i would make is that the kitchen could be better stocked to allow guests to cook meals (e.g. bowls  kettle  dish drying rack etc) and would be great if there was an iron in the house rather than having to ask for one. Other than that  a truly marvellous place to stay in corfu!!
37543437,Carolina August 2020 AMAZING place! We spent 9 nights there and enjoyed its external terrace  its lovely rooms and its location. A little paradise we would highly recommend
37543437,Renata October 2019 The house is really a little  perfect  clean and cosy home. The view is stunning. The position is one of the best in Corfù. Anastasia is really kind and precise. The silence is complete  but  if you need a market it is just five minutes from home and the sea too. So....what do you need more?
37543437,Aleksandra September 2019 We liked the villa very much. It’s beautiful with great interior and lovely terrace. The villa was very clean. The communication with Joerg and his housekeeper Anastasia was precise. There is a beach in 15 minutes walk near and a grocery in 10 minutes. Would like to return here once more.
37543437,Sophia August 2019 Our stay at the cottage was exactly what we were looking for and it exceeded our expectations! It’s stylish  functional  very clean  quiet and peaceful  great view from of the patio  good WiFi   big TV  quality kitchen appliances  comfortable bed and a nice shower.. really a home away from home. Wonderful location with nice taverns and supermarkets close by. Easy check in with Anastasia who is so nice and helpful . Joerg is a very attentive host who made sure we had everything we needed and was quick to reply to all requests. I fully recommend this Airbnb stay!
37543437,Ekaterina August 2019 The house is amazing. Very comfortable and cosy place in a quiet area. It is extra clean and has all the needed amenities around. Joerg  the host  and Anstasia are really nice and welcoming. They welcomed us with wine and generally help out with anything needed. Great stay

37543437,Jola August 2022 An incredibly peaceful  charming place with an enchanting landscape. For us  it will be one of the places we will remember for a long time. Everything perfectly prepared for the guests. Many thanks to Jörg and Maria. Translated from German  Show original
37543437,Sonia July 2022 Very good accommodation and very welcoming hosts. Accommodation with very nice view. Perfect stay Translated from French  Show original
37543437,Sabine June 2022 We felt very comfortable here. The place was very cozy and equipped to a high standard. Due to the self-contained air conditioning and the fly windows everywhere  it was more than good to bear. The small garden with terrace offers a beautiful view overlooking the sea. The tranquility up here is simply heavenly. Here you can also sleep at night with the window open instead of with an air conditioner. However  we as the plains of Tyrolean found the way to the accommodation a challenge  but in Corfu it is generally more mountainous. In any case  we can fully recommend Jörg as a host. Translated from German  Show original
37543437,Aad & Marleen June 2022 Fantastic place  100% tranquility and absolute privacy but still close to everything. Car is a must if you want to do something more than just lie on the beach in Nisaki. Both Maria and Joerg were great - always available and both communication and the care of the house+garden were great. Just got back  but we're missing our spot already! Translated from Dutch  Show original
37543437,Ann-Katrin May 2022 We spent 7 unforgettable days in the beautiful apartment. Mary welcomed us warmly  was always helpful and gave us great tips. The accommodation has great views of the mountains and the sea  captivates with total cleanliness and has everything you need to feel good. We are in love with Corfu and the little house and will come back for sure. Translated from German  Show original
37543437,Jos October 2021 A great stay in a wonderfully quiet location. The house is nice and fully furnished with enough space and nothing is missing. Quite clean and enthusiastically welcomed by Anastasia. The spacious terrace was fantastic with a great view. Despite the bad weather  it was a very pleasant stay where we would love to come back again. A top location! Translated from Dutch  Show original
37543437,Anne-Sophie September 2021 My mother (56) and I (25) really enjoyed the week at Joerg's cottage in Nissaki and we didn't miss anything. The accommodation is in a very good general condition and well equipped: air conditioning  insect screens  sun loungers in front of the house  a small selection of reading doors  etc. - all available. We were particularly pleased with the proximity to the beach!  Joerg is an extremely reliable host and always available to his guests. We have experienced him as very friendly and accommodating  the same goes for his employees Anastasia. We will be happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original
37543437,Christian June 2021 We had a wonderful time. The house was very nicely decorated with high end finishes. From the spacious terrace you have a great view. The location is perfect for exploring the island. Translated from German  Show original
37543437,Matthias September 2019 A truly exceptional little retreat with an amazing view over the bay to Corfu city. If you are looking for something special  off the beaten path of Corfu  unfortunately  quite well-suited  this is the place to be. In the village you have everything you need  but it is not crowded. A great  small beach is within walking distance (some sports due to the mountainous location included). Best communication in advance and on site  both with Jörg and with the very helpful housekeeper. So in short  a full recommendation - if it was Corfu  I would go here!

21932108,Daniel June 2022 Great stay Response from Posarelli Villas July 2022 Hi Daniel  Thank you for your feedback
21932108,Alessandro May 2022 The perfect place where to spend an amazing time! Well recommended! Response from Posarelli Villas May 2022 Hi Alessandro  thank you for your feedback  we are really happy you had a lovely week in Corfu.
21932108,Libby April 2022 The villa is beautiful and exactly how described! The surrounding area is less desirable though. When we arrived at the villa we were greeted with keys on the outside of the door and a note for the wifi password. A little more information on our location and where to get food/drink would’ve been appreciated. But I would definitely return again. Response from Posarelli Villas May 2022 Dear Libby  thank you for your review  we are happy you enjoyed your stay. Concerning the information I guess 10.30 pm it was just too late to have a nice chat and suggestions on what to do and where to go. I am sure if you only called the villa's owner the following morning he could have help you with plenty of ideas. Show more
21932108,Steven October 2021 Lovely villa in great location
21932108,Christoffer October 2021 The villa was very nice and everything worked  but there was some minor issues like the pool wasn’t clean and there were dirt from plants around the pool. The sewer also clocked up sometimes Response from Posarelli Villas November 2021 Dear Christoffer  thank you for your feedback  we were completely unaware about the issue . We've followed up on it to ensure that this is avoided in future.
21932108,Ryan September 2021 We had a great time here. It was nice to chill by the pool in the morning/afternoon and up in the balcony in the evening  Location is close to Corfu town. However  you will need a car to go to shops  beaches and restaurants.  A great place to stay!
21932108,Nathan September 2021 Beautiful villa  very nice clean interior with lots of sleeping space. The pool area is great for any time of the day and there is also a nice top floor outdoor terrace which has a bbq which is perfect for an evening meal. The location is okay  the villa is sort of in the middle of nowhere in terms of being able to walk to restaurants/supermarkets (there’s a Lidl but it’s about a 15 minute walk). However there is a bus stop just down the end of the road which provides easy access to either Corfu town or ipsos beach - both with plenty of places to eat and drink/ beaches to relax on. Communication was lacking with the hosts/agents. No one greeted us for check-in  there was not even a document left with general information on the area - etc wifi password  taxi numbers  car rental  local restaurant recommendations or supermarket locations. The host/agents were difficult to reach via phone and airbnb  with very long replies on the check in day (5hrs)  furthermore after calling the agency to enquire about the wifi password and information about the washing machine facilities and some other queries a member of my group was told by the agent that it was ‘not their job’ to answer those questions  which is not only unhelpful but quite rude. That aside  overall our stay was very enjoyable and we loved the villa (especially the 2 cute cats who hang around all day - named Pete & Bas). For the price the villa is a real bargain and I would recommend. Show more
21932108,Юлия November 2019 Villa is really great! It's ideal for a big company. A very beautiful see view on the thert floor. It was great to spend time on the swimming pool 😊 The bus stop is in 3 minutes to reach. In 15 minutes you will get the old town. The internet connection is wonderful!
21932108,Miriam October 2019 We had come from another property where we had not been met and had an automated check-in resulting in a somewhat fraught experience so we asked the villa owner to meet us which she did. This was appreciated. Its a beautiful and very spacious villa which a spectacular infinity pool. The kitchen has all the mod cons and there is a terrace at the top of the house where we had lunch a few times. The view out over the bay some of the reasons that make this property a great place to stay. It is secluded and relatively quiet despite running the gauntlet of tethered barking dogs just outside the property  something of an occupational hazard in Greece.
21932108,Rianne September 2019 Just returned from a lovely stay at Villa Jewel. We are a group of 7 girls in our mid-20’s and we had the best time! The villa is gorgeous  very spacious and very clean and tidy. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and they were very accommodating letting us come into the villa early. Highlights were the pool and the upstairs balcony which had a lovely view and was a great place to all sit and eat. Worth noting that it isn’t that close to anything so you do need to get the bus to the beach/restaurants/lidl (closest big supermarket) unless you are up for a long walk. The buses were very easy to navigate though! It also doesn’t have the best range of kitchen things so wouldn’t be easy to cook anything too adventurous. Saying that we didn’t think this affected our stay really and would highly recommend for a lovely holiday!
21932108,Tim August 2019 Villa Jewel is a beautiful villa about 5k from Corfu Town and 7k from the airport. Its secluded but close enough to get to Corfu Town and Govia very easily by bus (the number 7 is every 20 minutes for 1.70€). The set out of the Villa is wonderful with 3 floors and lots of space for a family or two to spread out. We particularly liked the swimming pool and the top floor BBQ area with views over the sea. The TV downstairs is easily connected to Netflix which kept the kids happy for a few nights. A little gem is the beach 300m in front of the road with a long pontoon and relaxed cafe.  The only downside is the proximity of a supermarket which is about 1k away (Lidl) and pretty tough with bags but you can take the bus. It would have been great to have some basic essentials on arrival and maybe a folder on local activities. The mid-week clean also never happened.  Overall a fabulous villa in a lovely country within easy reach of everything.
21932108,Jimmy August 2019 Best location
21932108,Brian April 2019 Nice house  but cooking a big meal is a challenge. The house is a very clean and spacious 3 story property  with the top level providing a nice view. There was a very friendly cat and another shy but sweet cat that hung out around the house  which we enjoyed. It was too cold when we were there to enjoy the pool  unfortunately (it is not heated). The only major gripes we had was with the appliances (the dishwasher and clothes washer were both in pretty bad shape; we stopped using the dishwasher because it seemed to be doing more harm than good). Also  if you want to cook big meals (like we did a few times with a group of 7) at the house  there was not sufficient enough cookware to accommodate that  and even basic cooking ingredient staples were not provided. We even had to buy our own cleaning supplies for the kitchen to clean up (dish soap  towels  sponges). Otherwise  it was a very nice home at a price that cannot be beat.
21932108,Elisabeth September 2018 We came to Villa Jewel in the end of September with 7 people. We had great wether. Around the House are some things to see  but its best to have a car for transportation. Even so we didnt need to leave the accomodation  cause it had everything we needed. The house was very clean and stylish. The local agent was really helpful and the service was beyond good. Thank you very much for this great week!
21932108,Helen August 2018 A wonderfully spacious villa that accommodates a large family without being in each other’s pockets. The location is great as it’s so close to Corfu town. The lady we had contact with regarding the villa was very accommodating and prompt and replying to emails. I would definitely recommend this villa to any family considering a stay in Corfu.
21932108,Kt July 2018 This is a great villages for a holiday with a group. The pool is nice and warm in the morning and there's lots of space for the entire group to hangout alone or together. The only issue is that this is an agency and not a local Host  so you're not going to get tips on local things like what to do or where to grocery shop. If you're fine with a hands off host than this is perfect for your group.
21932108,Joanna June 2018 Amazing villa!! Very modern! Great place to spend a vacation with your family and friends. Close to the Corfu town and public transportation!
21932108,Gloria May 2018 Great house for large families or groups - beautiful deco clean well appointed. Centrally located at Santa Caterina (agios caterini) near Kontokali. Bus stops within walking distance. Parking for a number of cars. Beautiful pool area and private garden. Hosts were responsive friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend this house if you do not wish to be in secluded area or middle of tourist spots. trips to Corfu town by bus or car within 15 mins
21932108,Xara April 2018 The house was more than awesome! Very clean  spacious  luxury and very close to the city. We definitely enjoyed our stay and It surpassed all our expectations!

21932108,Julie May 2019 The villa is very spacious  great pool  good view from the terrace. The location although not in the city  but it is very convenient and inexpensive to get by bus. There are a lot of dishes  appliances too  but they are not tidy  with muddy dirt. There is a dishwasher  but everything inside is already covered  we did not dare to turn it on. A bit upset with the lack of simple things like salt/sugar. Hot water outages. It was only on the first day of arrival  then the shower had to be taken under cold water. The internet is great  fast  it catches all over the house and on the terraces. Linen and towels are clean. The villa itself is very beautiful. Translated from Russian  Show original

26302983,Jakub August 2022 It was a very nice stay in Kato Pavliana. Host is very generous and will make sure you will feel like home. Space is very comfy and you will feel there like in a fairytaile:) It’s even a very good locality to stay  not far from beaches and a lot pf interesting places to visit  but hills are the best for chill and calm evenings.
26302983,Marek August 2022 Perfect
26302983,Jane July 2022 This was a very small  but lovely sweet little cottage/home in Kato Pavliana  a small  local town on Corfu Island. I think it the cottage will be too small for 4 adults  but it's OK for a family with 2 kids. We loved the local setting and was able to get a feel of what every day life in the hills of Corfu can be. It also has a beautiful view over the valley. If you want to experience something other than the busy beaches  we definitely recommend staying here. Lovely host too.
26302983,Ricard June 2022 Angeliki is very welcoming and helpful  and her place is comfortable and charming. We loved our holidays in Corfú.
26302983,Ralitsa June 2022 Great place to stay if you are exploring the island as it is situated almost in the middle of everything.
26302983,Markus October 2021 Angeliki is a very great host  we would for sure come again. Thank you 😃🙏👍🇬🇷
26302983,Kinga September 2021 This is the Perfect place if you like real vintage village houses. House is small ( enough space for 2) and beautiful. You will find here eveything you need for nice and comfy stay: air conditioner  coffe maker  all thing to cook a diner  tv and even small washing machine. Angeliki is very friendly and kind person. House was clean and perfectly prepared. Host provide also some basic food  coffe and drinks wich was really nice and helpfull. Village is small and quiet with beautiful views. Also there is very nice restaurant in the bottom of village with local product  we ate there our best dinner in Corfu. Absolutely recommend this place.
26302983,Andrew September 2021 I don’t have enough positive things to say  not only about Angeliki’s quaint and cozy cottage  but also about her kindness and hospitality that is unmatched in all of my experiences with Airbnb! This space was exactly what I was looking for  situated in a tiny village tucked up in the mountains. While there are limited options (as far as tavernas  etc.) within walking distance  one will need a vehicle to make the most of one’s time while staying in this lovely stone cottage. This was my best Airbnb experience hands down  and I’m the better for having met Angeliki! Να είσαι πάντα καλά Αγγελική! ❤️
26302983,Tamara September 2021 Very cute apartment in a small village about 40 minutes from Corfu city. Angeliki is an amazing host  who will help you with everything! There is one restaurant close to this apartment (about 10mins on foot)  everything else (Minimarkets  beaches  restaurants  bakerys) are reachable by car in 10-30 minutes. To get to this apartment and around the island you will definitely need a car  there are no public transports in this area. Angeliki will give you good and helpful tips also  we really enjoyed our stay there!
26302983,Anna August 2021 Angeliki's little cottage is ideally located: 30' from Kerkyra by car  it is close to many splendid beaches (Paramonas  Agios Gordios  Halikouna  Prasoudi) and great places (the whole Kerkyra  the Achilleion) to explore in Corfu. The village of Kato Pavliana is really small and peaceful  perfect to relax. My friend and I spent 15 days at Angeliki's place and really enjoyed our stay. She was always there for us. She also is very generous and very often offered us great food from her garden or from her kitchen (thank you for the moussaka  I bring it in my heart!) We both cannot but recommend her place! Evkaristo  thanks for all!
26302983,Marrit July 2021 Angeliki is by far the best host I’ve seen around. Whenever you have a question  she will do anything in her power to answer or help you out. The little house is adorable and Angeliki makes sure you have everything needed for your stay. Although it was short  this place is definitely on the list to revisit some time. Thank you Angeliki!!
26302983,Avner July 2021 Thank you very much for a romantic weekend. The house is very special and authentic. Angeliki was super kind and left us treats.
26302983,Vanilla November 2020 We had a wonderful time in this quaint  traditional Greek cottage with its stunning views across the neighbouring hills and over to the Ionian Sea. Our host Angelica was perfect from start this finish! She was hospitable and helpful. The village itself was beautiful with walks through pleasant olive groves at every turn. We shall certainly be back!
26302983,Mary September 2020 Without doubt the most memorable stay for all the right reasons. This traditional home is situated in a small village in the hills  but only a 10 minute drive to Agios Gordios  30 minutes from the airport  and is well-situated for touring the mid and south area of the island. Well equipped  we had everything we needed for a long stay. Angeliki the owner lives next door and was there to welcome us despite our very late arrival. Her hospitality is second to none - nothing was too much trouble and we felt like family  her home is comfortable  spotlessly clean and a very uniquely Greek experience. Lovely personal touches around the home and throughout our stay made it very special indeed. The weather was hot (we stayed in September) but I think it would be equally lovely to stay during the winter months and make use of the cosy log burner and walking routes that pass just outside the house. Parking is easy  views from the little seating area outside are splendid  hot water plentiful. We cannot recommend this accommodation enough and without doubt will be returning again soon. A truly wonderful stay in a beautiful part of the island.
26302983,Irena August 2020 Angeliki is an angel of hospitality. Even thought the house is a bit too small for four adults  the coziness really charmes you. This tiny place feels like home. I can imagine staying here for all four seasons!
26302983,Юлия October 2019 Small  cozy  very stylish  clean house. We really enjoyed being in it. Furniture  decor  decor is very unusual. A lot of antiques that really decorate your stay in the house. Angelica is very kind  hospitable and caring. Met us early in the morning. We had a varied delicious breakfast. We often meet with different sweets and pastries on the table. Everything was very sincere and cozy. We’ll come to Angelica in the house next year -100% May the Lord bless Angelica and her entire family
26302983,Elena October 2019 Angelikis place is very comfortable and warm. From the first moment we felt homey. We enjoyed the time a lot. Highly recommended!
26302983,Salvatore August 2019 The host is very friendly and the house nice!
26302983,Alexander June 2019 Beautifully furnished cottage located in a small town full of nice people. In the morning from the terrace is a beautiful view of the island. A great point for people with a car planning to explore the island. I highly recommend this place and the host!
26302983,Lena April 2019 Angelikis house is in a really tiny  cute village up the mountains. There is a bus  but I'm pretty sure it only departs once a day  so it's better to have a car. The house itself is very nice with a little sunny terrace. There is so much love in the little details. Angeliki is such a nice warm person. She is really attentive and really goes out of her ways to make you feel at home. I really did enjoy my stay with her.
26302983,Sophie October 2018 It's a beautiful and really special place to stay. Angeliki and her brother are great hosts. We had everything we needed- and even more :) home baked cake  a wonderful view  great hospitality...

26302983,Lindsay September 2018 A really interesting small cottage with eclectic furnishings & fittings. The hosts are very kind and attentive and it is an ideal position to explore the whole of Corfu by car. Each evening on our way home we looked forward to the food and drink treats left for us.
26302983,Selina September 2018 The location is perfect. In a quiet village away from tourists apart from a few walkers on the corfu trail right outside the house. The house is great  very cosy and quaint. Great views. Angeliki is a fantastic host and very hospitable. Lots of nice and thoughtful touches. We had a great time.
26302983,Linda August 2018 we spent a week in the delightful house of Angeliki  a strategic position  close to the sea but far from the confusion and crowded tourist structures. the house is very well kept and clean  Angeliki is really welcoming and every morning she prepares very nice breakfasts. Exceptional quality/price ratio. We will absolutely recommend to friends
26302983,Edvard August 2018 We stayed 2 nights at Angeliki's apartment. The home is located 10 minutes from Ag. Gordios via scooter in a small village Kato Pavliana. The home is nice and cozy and has an oldschool and traditional style to it. Angeliki lives right next door so if we needed anything we could just ask. Very nice and hospitable people. Angeliki offered to take us to Ag. Gordios to rent a scooter and also took us back when we checked out. Definitely need some sort of transportation (bike or car) if you stay here  it's good to explore the nearby areas with aswell. The only negative thing I can think of is that there isn't air conditioning in the apartment  only a fan. It gets pretty hot in the summer so it would've been nice but taking the price of stay in consideration it's really not that bad. Overall a nice  cute and comfortable home with the best hosts!
26302983,Katharina July 2018 Very nice and quiet place. Very beautiful house with everything you need. Very friendly hosts who helped us in all situations.
26302983,Ortensia July 2018 Very interesting position  Kato Pavliana is a small village in a very green part of the island  it's rural and authenthic greek! Your location will be great to reach all the south beaches of Corfù. The house is small but has very charming interiors and furniture. The sweet host Angeliki with her attentions and care made us feel at home. Excellent value for money!!
26302983,Konstantinos July 2018 Great host and the house is ideal for daily trips around Corfu
26302983,Susie July 2018 We had a very great time in Angelika and Michalis house. The house is tiny but sooo comfy and cute  the view is amazing in this quite town. The best of the trip is clearly the hosts : very welcoming  they had a lot of attentions  the breakfast was very good. Everything was perfect!! I deeply recommand this place if you want to find quite and real greec way of life  close to everything. Response from Αγγελική July 2018 Thanks for the susie for her good words. Perhaps there are not the right words for someone to talk about staying in our place of susie and estelle. They were in every respect flawless  discreet  sensitive  courteous. They left the place for their homeland leaving them neat and clean and flooded with the sweet aroma of their short presence. I wish all the guests that will be hosted in our premises have the same attitude and show the same respect as the susie and the estelle. We thank them for their presence in honor of our little house. We are pleased that they felt beautiful feelings from their stay in it and the fact that we also responded to their expectations. Show more
26302983,Thiéry October 2022 It has to be said that to come to Kato Pavliana  especially at night it is not easy. But once you get there  it's a real slice of heaven.

26302983,"Max July 2021 A great home! The apartment is lovingly decorated and functionally equipped with everything you could ever need. From the terrace you have a wonderful view over the valley to the sea. The village is small  quaint and secluded  you should have a car at your disposal. Angeliki is a wonderful host who also provided us with fresh bread  fruits  vegetables and even beer once in a while. Communication was smooth throughout  both before arrival and during the stay. Within walking distance (about 5 minutes walk) is the Taverna Romantico (good food!)  about 15 minutes by car it takes you to the ""Sunset Wine and Dine"" (Manelouzo's) between Kato Garouna and Ano Garouna (fantastic food  great view). The only shortcoming was the very sagging mattress  which we could also upgrade to a cozy bed with some improvisation (we put the guest bed mattress on the bed). Big people have to be aware that the old house is built quite low after all  so you have to watch your head. However  this is only an indication and not a criticism. We would come back anytime! One more word about the cats: four definitely come to the terrace. In the evening  after sunset  they enjoy two cans of cat food  placed next to and in front of the fence. 😉 Show more Translated from German  Show original"
26302983,Karol July 2021 With a heavy heart  we left The Little Sweet Home and Kato Pavliana. Our stay there was incredibly nice. Above all  you can really relax there. The village of Kato Pavliana is very small and does not have much to offer but for people who really want to be far away from tourism and big cities  it is perfect! Plus the cute cats right outside the door in the morning and an old dog Harris who visited us on the veranda all night. It is worth renting a car. You travel around the island all day and in the evening you can enjoy the peace and the view in Kato Pavliana. A dream! You can easily park the car next to the house. There were no problems at all.  Angeliki's house is very clean and has everything you need. The kitchen is fully equipped. The house is perfect for two people  we felt very comfortable there  just like at home. The air conditioning works very well and so we were able to survive the incredibly high temperatures. Angeliki was so kind and even prepared us cold drinks when we arrived. In addition  a bottle of Greek wine was waiting for us! Angeliki is really a perfect host  she is very nice and very helpful. She gave us many tips  what else is worth seeing. She also brought us fresh vegetables for breakfast. When we left  we even got a small Greek gift from her  it was very tasty!  Unfortunately  there is no restaurant or supermarket in Kato Pavliana  but already about 5 km away  in Agios Gordios you can eat and also shop. But it's just crazy that you can get a fresh  still warm bread about 50 meters from The Little Sweet Home.It was just perfect for breakfast!  We are very pleased to have chosen the Little Sweet Home. We have seen for ourselves what life looks like in a Greek village. A great experience. Plus many nice residents of the village who have welcomed us every time.  We will be very happy to remember our holiday in Kato Pavliana with Angeliki! Thank you very much Angeliki and best regards from Rostock!

26302983,"Friederike October 2020 Αγγελική is a very cheerful and warm host! Since the communication via airbnb was in German/Greek automatic translation  we were only a bit skeptical about how far you can communicate directly. When we arrived  we were able to find out more easily that Αγγελική also speaks English:) The accommodation is really cosy antique as seen in the pictures. Unique! Various beaches are within easy reach and it is also not far to the Sissi Castle. Αγγελική even brought us a map where she marked her excursion tips! Unlike described in other reviews  breakfast was not brought to us in the morning  but Αγγελική the apartment had stocked with toast and rusks  juice  coffee powder  butter  jam  honey  sausage and cheese. If something went wrong or we had another wish (with us  for example  milk)  we were allowed to let her know and then she brought it to us. Once there was also fresh (still hot) bread from the village bakery right next door and small tomatoes. Towels were ample. Although we were only there for a week  Αγγελική (without us asking for it) even brought us another basket of fresh towels (and fresh bedding). Otherwise  we could always ask (when I didn't get the gas stove or the hot water  for example) and Αγγελική helped quickly and very kindly. It really was a ""sweet home"" for us.

Perhaps the most beautiful thing is that in a few hours you are welcomed by the whole country  first of all the very nice neighbor! A few meters away there is a tavern that only makes quick snacks but if you agree beforehand you can also prepare typical dishes. The location is excellent: you are in the heart of the southern part of the island which is absolutely the most beautiful and less crowded.

The two landlords live right next door and are very nice  hospitable and helpful.

Other than that this place is great!!

The apartment is exactly as is seen in the images - and the main bonus is that it’s 4/5min walk to the sandy beach (longer when coming back the steep incline uphill!) I would recommend car hire to get around with ease  as the bay is fairly secluded  the apartment has its own designated parking bay - the mini-mart is good for basics  the bigger supermarkets are easily accessible via car and are from 15-20mins away.  We had a great relaxing time  a must visit is the tour of Paxos & Antipaxos. I highly recommend.
41465526,Saretta July 2020 Beautiful place  the location is breathtaking  the view is spectacular. The house was clean and we found everything we needed. The balcony its a touch of style   we had amazing dinner out there. The owner was super helpful and kind . I recommend this place if you are looking for peace of mind  beautiful sea and total relax. LOVED IT
41465526,Lisann November 2022 We had a great few days in Spiros’ apartment. At the beginning of November  we were almost alone on the beach in the bright sunshine and had the holiday resort all to ourselves. The furnishings of the apartment are a bit outdated  but the fantastic view of the bay and the sun balcony could more than make up for this. Translated from German  Show original
41465526,Katharina April 2022 Beautiful accommodation with fabulous views over the bay; beach within easy reach; amenities not the most modern but cozy and well-equipped apartment with dream balcony; highly recommended Translated from German  Show original
41465526,Christopher July 2021 We highly recommend staying at Spiros Apartment. He is a courteous host who will leave you a bottle of wine and water to welcome you. The view of the beach is predestined for beautiful moments. We would come back! Translated from German  Show original
41465526,Axelle May 2021 Very pleasant stay The seaside resort is still closed but we were well informed. To be repeated with pleasure. Translated from French  Show original
41465526,Dörte October 2020 simple accommodation  but the location and view are fantastic: the resort is nicely designed and is located in a bay. From the balcony you have a beautiful view of the sea  you can also hear it rustling. There are one or two restaurants in the village  a hotel bar  so not for night owls. It is 30 minutes to the capital  and other bays and small places can also be reached during this time. Translated from German  Show original
41465526,Dennis October 2020 It was a very nice holiday. The place was clean but the furnishings were a bit older but apart from the fact that the bed could have been more comfortable it was very nice. The view from the balcony to the sea was wonderful. The path to the apartment is a bit steeper and more strenuous and I would not recommend it to elderly people or people with disabilities. All in all  it was a great stay and we even got extra towels from Spiro's wife. Vielen Dank und Beste Grüße Dennis und Conny  It was a very nice vacation. The accommodation was clean but the furniture was a bit older but apart from the fact that the bed could have been more comfortable it was very nice. The view from the balcony to the sea was wonderful. The way to the apartment is a bit steeper and more strenuous and I would not recommend it to older people or people with disabilities.

41465526,Lionel August 2020 We strongly recommend this flat and Glyfada. Excellent 3 night stay  The apartment was perfect for 2  and very good for 3. Probably a little tighter for 4 (our 2 adult children stayed one night with us  no worries though) Beautiful view  the most beautiful we have had among our 4 rentals in Corfu. Glyfada beach is superb  and the apartment has several openings  all with beautiful views. The terrace is very nice  and we had dinner there every night (We tried the nearest beach restaurant  which we advise against: medium and bad value for money  despite very nice service). The beach of Glyfada at the foot of the residence (2 minutes uphill) is a long sandy beach in which you can walk for a long time. The mountain and the vegetation around very beautiful too. We loved it  Spiros and his wife allowed us to stay for what more hours during checkout  it was also very nice. Very comfortable bedding. Very efficient air conditioning. No mosquitoes. Translated from French  Show original
648549383321601747,Julia October 2022 A beautiful beach apartment tucked away in the sunny side of the hill. The balcony  all day sun and view are worth the winding road down to the beach. Will be coming back!
648549383321601747,Jennifer September 2022 The apartment is just as described and seen in the pictures. Very clean and equipped. The communication with Spiros was super easy and he was extremely helpful. Just consider that it's easier to come by car because the location is a bit secluded  but you can find everything you need within a few minutes of walking distance. The beach is lovely and perfect for relaxing. I can definitely recommend staying at Spiros'place. :D
648549383321601747,Carina September 2022 The accommodation was clean and is stylishly furnished. The bathroom is unfortunately very outdated and smells very unpleasant and the beds are very hard. The view is very nice and the proximity to the beach is great and the communication with Spiros was smooth and fast.
648549383321601747,Milcho September 2022 great place for a nice and quite vacation  wonderful beach and reasonable prices
648549383321601747,Christine September 2022 We had a beautiful time in Spiros appartement. Its clean  comfortable  cosy  quite and the view from the balcony is really great. The area has everything you need - restaurants  bars  the beach  the blue and clear ocean etc.  Spiros is super friendly and a really nice host. He is really helpful in any time. Thanks a lot!
648549383321601747,Signe August 2022 Very nice apartment and host! We enjoyed our stay with a fantastic view from the balcony and close to the beach. Spiros is super helpful.
648549383321601747,Lene July 2022 We had a great time here! Spiros was the perfect house  and even picked us up at the airport when we arrived in the middle of the night and took us to the Airbnb. He was super helpful throughout our stay and provided us with lots of good recommendations :)  Glyfada was a bit isolated and it wasn’t too easy getting around with a taxi/public transportation  so we had great use of rental electrical bikes/rental car to get around.
648549383321601747,Sarah July 2022 Spiros was the perfect host and provided us with a lot of nice recommendations. The flat was clean  well equipped and had an amazing seaside view with a 2 minute walk to the beach. I can totally recommend to stay at his place. We were staying one week and it almost felt like home.
648549383321601747,Daniela August 2022 The apartment has 180° sea views. Is about 20 m from a sandy  silky beach. Spiros  our host was friendly   warm  willing to help us with everything. What more can we ask of our host? We highly recommend it Translated from French  Show original
648549383321601747,Cindy August 2022 We had a great time in this beautiful apartment. The view is very nice. The apartment is close to the beach and the mini market that sells the essentials. Shame was that every day and especially in the evening  very loud music was played at the beach bar  which hit the whole beach. But you are centrally located in Corfu and it is not far from Corfu city. all in all  it was one of our most beautiful vacations  also because the accommodation was so beautiful. Translated from German  Show original
648549383321601747,Josep July 2022 Small but very cozy apartment. Spiros hospitality is amazing  he will do his best to make you feel comfortable in the apartment! Translated from Spanish  Show original
48992474,Dragan August 2022 Vasilis was a fantastic host who went above and beyond - the true definition of a super host. He was very responsive  accommodating  and punctual who thought of all of the little things. Sole di Corfu is situated in a very charming village which serves as the perfect starting point for exploring Corfu island (not to mention it is steps away from a great bakery). It is very well equipped with everything you may need for your vacation  and is even more beautiful than the pictures depict! The place was also perfectly clean - our family is very picky and we could not spot one fault as it was tip top tidy. Vasilis has really set the standard for the perfect Airbnb  and we strongly recommend his place for your vacation on Corfu!
48992474,Luke July 2022 This place was even better than expected. Clean. Modern. Convenient. Vasilis was an excellent host and even waited 2 hours for us passed the time we set due to our flight being delayed. The place has everything you need and amazing views in the morning/evening. Really was a great stay from start to finish.
48992474,Erman July 2022 Vasilis was very welcoming. The flat was clean and nicely furnished.
48992474,Kristin July 2022 Our stay at Sole di Corfu was awesome! It is conveniently located between the southern beaches and Corfu Old Town and just a short walk (up the hill) to Acheilleon Palace. We were two couples  so we didn’t even use the third bedroom. The beds were comfortable  and the two main bathrooms were well-equipped. The most amazing thing was the fabulous sunset views from the spacious wrap-around patio! Vasilis was a wonderful host. He left us a few ‘pods’ of laundry detergent and a drying rack  so we were able to get caught up on our vacation laundry before venturing on! That was helpful! Vasilis met us at the house to help us with check-in and to provide some wonderful suggestions for places to go/things to do. The space was comfortable for lounging  and the kitchen was well-stocked. Overall  we loved our stay at Sole di Corfu  and Vasilis was a fabulous host!
48992474,Karolina June 2022 Everything was perfect  the cleanest stay of all time. View is beautiful  location is also good. There is parking space for car. Every room with ac and netflix.
48992474,René May 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at the accommodation! The check-in was super well-organized and we received a lot of helpful comments for our vacation!
48992474,Emily September 2021 Beautiful and clean house! Had everything we needed. Very convenient as the bus stop is right infront of the house to get to Corfu town  however would suggest a car for the trip in general if you want to get to any other parts of the island as the bus doesn’t come often for the entire day and you’ll need to really schedule out your day. Vasilis and his wife was very welcoming and responsive to all our questions and even greeted us with water  wine  bread and jam in the fridge!
48992474,Ezgi September 2021 The apartment we stayed was amazing! It was very clean and comfortable. The view from the balcony was just perfect if you want to relax or see the sunset. The host and his family were so friendly. At one day we forgot the keys inside as we stepped outside. The hosts father immediately came and helped us to get the keys. They also gave us new towels. Further  they answered all of our questions. All in all it was just a 10/10. We felt like family members. Really can recommend this apartment!!!!
48992474,Helen September 2021 This place was spacious and immaculate. I highly recommend staying here. The host was very hospitable with great recommendations. Thank you Vasili!
48992474,Ana-Maria August 2021 Sole di Corfu is just great  we had a lovely one week staying in Corfu. The place is located close enough to the Old Town but also great to go around the island and explore if you have a car. The house is very nice  better than in the pictures and very clean. The hosts were very nice  welcoming and helpful when we had any questions or queries  the communication was great.
48992474,Cristina August 2021 Amazing place and very nice host! The house looks very nice  better than in the pictures! And the view it's amazing! I recommend it!
48992474,Nikolas July 2021 Very nice place in the hills of Corfu close to the sea and many beaches. We really enjoyed our stay!
48992474,Lucie July 2021 we spent an exceptional stay. Honestly  I am used to using airbnb and I think it is the airbnb in which we were most welcomed  Vasilis received us and explained everything  she was also our tour guide. It is a house which was completely new with all the necessary equipments. The view from the house is just splendid and the setting is magnificent  we warmly thank Vasilis for everything!
48992474,Adriana September 2022 Exceptional place. Every detail taken care of. Super equipped !! coffee  bread  wine  beach towels. A luxury. 100% recommended. Great host!!! Translated from Spanish  Show original
48992474,"Giuseppe September 2022 Perfect experience. We stayed in 6 in the beautiful apartment ""Sol di Corfu"" located in the city of Gastouri. The host since we booked has been super friendly helping us with every need  but really whatever problem we had. The beautiful house  located 20 minutes from the center of Corfu and 5 from the sea of Benitses. A real relaxation  including every comfort. We had a really good time and we will recommend everyone staying in this apartment. Translated from Italian  Show original"
48992474,Sandrine August 2022 Thank you Vasilis for this beautiful home sharing  advice and excellent hosting! You are a charming and caring family  I highly recommend for those wishing to discover Corfu. Ideally located  clean  modern and very spacious accommodation  nothing is missing ( can be a dishwasher for sloths😅). The calm of this charming village seduced us! We'll give our friends your address. Thank you for contributing to our comfort! Sandrine and Pascal Translated from French  Show original
48992474,Marie-Laure July 2022 Vasilis' apartment is very comfortable  nicely arranged and spotlessly kept. We stayed there for 4 (2 couples) and enjoyed the comfort  location and thoughtful kindness of our host. A great base to discover the southern part of Corfu  far from the hustle and bustle of the city  in a quiet environment but offering a lot of amenities and above all a magnificent view of the surrounding hills. Recommended without reservation. Translated from French  Show original
48992474,Liliana June 2022 Our stay has been wonderful. The place is brand new and pristine. The location is spectacular  close to Kerkira and at the same time a haven of peace. Vasilis and his wife were super attentive  change of towels  gave us fantastic recommendations.  Our experience has been amazing. The house is completely new and refurbished. The location is also amazing  very close to Corfu town but  at the same time private and quiet. Vasilis and his wife very kind. The made us a lot of and helpful recommendations.

48992474,Krzysztof August 2021 Sole di Corfu is the place to go when you want to explore the island. (must-see car) It's the perfect getaway. Apartment interior is new and fully equipped. Big and functional rooms. Plus a large terrace with a great view. We had a wonderful time here. 3 adults and 2 children. The owner of Vasilis is very cultural  kind and helpful! He helped and advised on a lot of things. AMAZING HOST! Recommended for anyone who wants to spend an unforgettable holiday in Corfu. Translated from Polish  Show original
48992474,Stephanie July 2021 Great experience! Vasilis and Konstadina are very sweet people and gave us a warm welcome. They also had nice tips to explore the area.  Very nice apartment  brand new.

10737469,Ettiene September 2016 Fantastic location in the best little town on Corfu. Pelekas is homely and the views are phenomenal. The restaurants has great food and alot of different varieties to choose from. make sure to visit Pink Panther  best wood oven pizza's by far. Corfu town very close with a great old town shopping market. Glyfada beach is at the foot hills of Pelekas  an amazing beach to go and relax at. This place will definitely see us again.
10737469,Maria July 2020 A fantastic house on the hillside  surrounded by olive trees and cypresses  with the fantastic view to the sea. Large pool and very nice outdoor terrace. Everything is thoughtful and comfortable  you can completely relax. Pelekas is a picturesque village  with many restaurants and cafes  you get a lot of useful tips on arrival (many thanks to Makis  he was always there for every question). We had beautiful Urlab in Dragana's villa and will definitely come again. Translated from German  Show original
10737469,Luna June 2018 Beautiful villa! Exceptional space  both inside and out  ideal for 6 people. Breathtaking views and outdoor space with enchanting pool and patios. Convenient location to the island  a bit secluded  in a grove but close to the center of Pelekas. Excellent overall rating  the only thing missing is the wifi. Translated from Italian  Show original
45812728,Steve October 2022 The house is amazing  just as the advert says  30 seconds walk to the beach and very secluded. Unfortunately the rain stopped us enjoying the garden most of the time but it looked amazing and added to the sense of being away from the rest of the world  loved it. The hosts were brilliant  responded when we had an issue with the power after a massive storm and we’re amazing. Couldn’t have done more for us and we really appreciated it. Fantastic  we would come back again definitely
45812728,Elise August 2022 We spend a wonferfull time in Aleca’s house.  The welcoming was very warm   thanks a lot. Private beach was so great!!!
45812728,René August 2022 Amazing house in an even better location. It‘s a 1 minute walk to the beach that is only used by very few people. You can go swimming there and leave all of your things at the beach without any worries. Perfect for a family or people that want to get away from other people. The house itself was clean and had all necessities for a great vacation. I personally thought that it was even better than what you can see in the pictures (the bathroom has been remodeled). Dionisis was a great host  he checked in with us regularly and responded pretty much immediately to any message we sent. Be advised that this house is in a rather remote location. I definitely recommend you to get a rental car as you will have to walk approx. 30 minutes to the next store/restaurant. Corfu town and the airport is a little more than one hour away by car.
45812728,Tim June 2022 Aleca‘s House is a piece of heaven. We enjoyed every moment. The house is absolutely clean  the communication was fast und superb  it is even better than the pictures illustrate. the bath is brand-new. the private beach is very close  only a 1-minute walk. it is quiet and offers a relaxing atmosphere. we had a rental car - that would be recommended. we are a couple with a 18 month baby. it was perfect :-)
45812728,Sue June 2022 Basileos and his family were helpful and pleasant. They recommended car hire which was considerably cheaper than what we had seen online. They were very pleasant when we caused a big problem by locking ourselves out which took quite a while to resolve. I was dissapointed that the walk on the 'picturesque path through the forest that leads to the village on foot' mentioned in the description of the property was impassible as it was far too overgrown. Response from Βασίλειος June 2022 Dear Sue It took quite a while to solve the problem(almost 1 hour) cause we couldn't contact you cause you never answered the messages or our calls! Concerning the path through the forest that we mention as you say  we personally have cleaned the most part of the way  but is a public path not a private one   so it's not our responsibility!! Thank you very much Show more
45812728,Teresa June 2022 Alecas House is truely hidden gem. when we arrived  we were truely over whelmed. the pictures do not do it justice. it was perfect in everyway. if you like peace and quiet  this is the place. The beach is so close and you have it all to yourself. You do need transport as Alecas House is very remote. We will be returning as it was truely paradise
45812728,Doug May 2022 We stayed for 5 nights with our newborn baby. The house is nice if a little small insde but the outdoor area is very nice. There is a very empty beach within walking distance from the house which is nice. The area however isn't the nicest we have stayed in Crofu. Very good and helpful host.
45812728,Sam May 2022 We had a great stay at Aleca's house. Everything was just as described and pictured - very relaxing and peaceful. Surrounded by nature  secluded  with a big shady garden  barbecue  and a lovely beach just steps away. When we visited in early-mid May we saw dozens of fireflies every evening in the meadow opposite the house  a really special experience.  We wanted to avoid hiring a car and it was do-able  although undoubtedly everything would be much easier with one. You can take a Green bus from Corfu town to Lefkimmi  but probably need to arrange transport to the house because the road is not suitable for dragging a suitcase. The walk from the house to the river at Lefkimmi is about 20 minutes  with some nice bars and restaurants (we recommend Agali). There are shops there which are good for basics and one of them did deliveries to the house. Lefkimmi port is about 15 minutes walk along the beach but we were told that it's not always possible to go that way  depending on the weather. The bigger supermarkets are too far to walk but we hired a bike from 'Riders' in Kavos  which delivered and collected it from the house. The supermarkets are about 15-20 mins away by bike (be warned it's a bit hilly).  Dionisis was incredibly helpful throughout and we really appreciated his kindness.  Overall a great experience and highly recommended. Show more
45812728,Paulien May 2022 Beautifull location Friendly host Very peacfull and quiet place
45812728,Michael April 2022 Our stay at Aleca’s house was fantastic. The house is just as it looks on the photos and very clean.  The location was great and a short drive from Lefkimmi town with a few nice tavernas. We would recommend hiring a car.  Dionissis was extremely helpful with great tips on places to eat and visit.  We would highly recommended this place!
45812728,Suzanne April 2022 Dionisis and his family are exemplary  personal hosts. From initial contact to a very warm welcome on arrival  with personal touches like basics in the fridge and croissants for breakfast  Dionisis was extremely helpful and on hand all holiday for advice. He recommended activities  restaurants (the Sofrito with rice at Agali was delicious) and beaches. One thing to bear in mind off-season is that most tavernas/restaurants will be closed  even if google says they are open! The house is very clean and the property safe and contained. It’s quiet and off the beaten track - a good base for exploring the island. Thank you for our lovely stay!
45812728,Peter October 2021 We had such a great week in this house! It's very nice and useful. There is everything you need. Even a nespresso coffee machine :) The garden is beautiful and big enough for kids to play around. You walk 1 minute to the beach which was like a private beach for us - nobody ever was there. And it's little  but really nice beach too!  Dionisis was very helpful  especially with recommendations for beaches and restaurants. And he even helped us out twice as the battery of our rental car was down and he called friends to come. He responded always within a few minutes and was very kind.  We already think of coming back again next year - that says everything :) Go there and enjoy this beautiful and quiet place so close to the beach
45812728,Thomas October 2021 A great place  very local. Host is very helpful! If you're looking for a more traditional Greek experience  this is the place.
45812728,Natasha September 2021 Lovely house. Quiet and peaceful. Next to pretty beach. Very near lefkimmi port. Great communication with host.
45812728,Malcolm September 2021 in corfu in September...weather variable. a lot of wasps on beaches and about.
45812728,Artemis August 2021 This is a lovely little house  literally 50 steps from the beach  in a very quiet area. The house is also in walking distance from the small village next to it  through a path among the trees  which took you to the nearest grocery shop in 10 minutes. Dionysis was always available for help and suggestions for restaurants and beaches to visit and he was warmly helpful with everything we needed. He even brought us umbrellas for the beach in case we couldn't find any shade.
45812728,Nikolaus August 2021 We had a great time in Aleca´s home in Lefkimmi. We found the house exactly like on the pictures and we were surprised by the small almost private beach. Only twice we saw other people there. The house has all kitchen equipment needed  airconditioning was also great and altogether it was perfectly clean. We especially liked the very nice garden with the big table and bbq area next to it. The house is a bit off the main road so a rental car is a must! But due to this fact it is a very quied and relaxing location. Donisis was a great host. He gave us a lot of details about the island during check in and was always available by phone when we had a question! Thanks!! We can only recommend this house if you are looking for a quiet place without the tourist crowds.
45812728,Stuart July 2021 Dionisis is a great host. He was very very helpful and always responded instantaneously. The house was exactly as described. The garden was great providing lots of shade. The private beach is located less than a hundred meters from the house. It is a nice sandy shallow beach perfect for our 6 and 4 years old kids. We had the impression of going into a bath because the water was so warm. We could walk through a bucolic path to the closest tavern in 15 minutes and to the mini market in 18 minutes. With a car obviously much less. The house is in a very calm and relaxing area far from the hustle and bustle which is exactly what wanted. A car is needed if you wish to visit the whole island. We loved our stay and hope we will be able to come again.
45812728,Manuela July 2021 We had a great stay at Aleca's House. Dionisis parents welcomed us warmly and provided us with everything we've needed. Also Dionisis was very attentive and answered any questions we've had within minutes. The house itself is very clean and equipped with everything we've needed for cooking  washing etc. The sorrounding garden is astonishing. It is a flower paradise with lots of shadowy places to rest and eat outside. The seaside is in 2 minutes reach from the house by foot and has a lovely private beach which is also perfect for little children. Thank you again for the wonderful stay!!
45812728,Michael June 2021 The house is really lovely  you have everything you need. Its really next to the beach. Two minutes by foot  with your own beach chairs. The water is crystal clear and you can reach Bouka Beach  an organized beach with music by walking along the waterside for around 15 minutes. The house is absolutely clean  the terrasse is shady. There are many beautiful and fragrant plants in the garden. You can reach the next touristic city  Kavos  in several minutes by car. There you find shops  restaurants  beaches  a haven  boat rental and others. Supermarkets (also Lidl) and pharmacy are nearby. Also a few minutes by car. Dionisis wasn't personally present  we were welcomed by his parents who are very very friendly and lovely! Dionisis was available by WhatsApp whenever we needed (to know) something. We would really recommend this pretty house if you like a quiet place to relax and have privacy (also at the beach!) in pure nature. There are very friendly neighbours  whom you might see mainly at the weekend. It's recommended to rent a car.
45812728,Georgios April 2021 wonderful little house close to the beach! amazing host! definitely recommended  I'll definitely visit again..
45812728,Dimitra April 2021 Very cool place! Dionisis is very helpful and I enjoyed my stay at the fullest. The house was very clean and cozy. I strongly recommend this house for your holidays or work in the island :D
45812728,Giovanna April 2021 Beautiful location with great hospitality!! I definitely recommend it! Thank you very much!
45812728,Evelyn April 2021 I had a few wonderful days at the beautiful home of Dionisis. Really  it feels like paradise when you arrive! Everywhere it's super green  with lots of plants  tress and this cute garden. You have so much freedom and space around you. No noise  no traffic  just peace. The beach is just right next to the house . It feels like if it is your own beach because there is no one around! But you have pure nature around you. The house is super cute with all the lovely details. And most important: Everything is perfectly clean! In the kitchen you find everything you need. Also in the rooms Dionisis prepared everything you need - towles  soap  bed sheets  Tv  Wifi  hairdryer  washing machine...like really everything you need. And last but not least: Dionisis is such a lovely host! He was welcoming so warm and gave me the best tips for the area around. Thank you again for the stay at your house in paradise  Dionisis. I will come back for sure! Best  Evelyn :)
45812728,Rike October 2022 We loved Aleca and Vasilis' house. The mattresses were very good  the kitchen is very well equipped  the bathroom newly renovated and in the garden you always found a sunny or shady place. Dionisis (the son) took great care of us and answered all the questions immediately. The small private beach is only 50 meters away and offers pure relaxation with sun loungers and clean water. Thanks for a great week. Translated from German  Show original
45812728,Michela August 2022 Our stay at Aleca House was perfect. If you are looking for absolute tranquility and relaxation  it is the perfect place. Perfect size of the house for a family of 4  lovely garden to eat out and practically private beach 4 steps away. Dionisi  Aleca and Vasilis were very kind and helpful. Taking care of your garden was a pleasure! Thank you for these memorable days. Translated from Italian  Show original

45812728,"Laurence July 2022 Very nice little house  great location. A real little ""paradise"". We had a very pleasant and relaxing 2 weeks. Dionisis was always available to respond to our requests  excellent host. Thanks to her equally nice and present parents. New bathroom and very nice bedrooms. The ""private"" beach is 100 m away. We highly recommend this property. We would not hesitate to go back Translated from French  Show original"
45812728,Théophile June 2022 We spent a week at Aleca's Home  very nice place away from the hustle and bustle. The place was clean and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom has been completely redone! A car is recommended. Our host gave us some great tips and always responded quickly. We recommend Aleca's Home! Translated from French  Show original
45812728,Marie April 2022 Aleca's house is located to the south  very secluded with access to its own small beach. It is very quiet and peaceful there  everything super clean and functional. We were very warmly welcomed by our hosts  even homemade cakes were there for us!! Dionisis was always approachable and inquired about us  offered help several times and gave tips. We had a very nice time there  the small garden offers space for the children to play. We made excursions and hikes from there to great beaches and to the fishing village of petriti  where there was a great fish shop. We were there in the low season  not everything is open  but it is just very quiet and peaceful!! Highly recommended!!! Translated from German  Show original
45812728,Petra August 2021 Dionisis' parents welcomed us warmly and showed us everything! The cottage is small but cozy and furnished with everything you need. The air conditioning also allowed us to have a pleasant temperature in the house for sleeping. The arbor with the dining area in the garden is beautifully grown and provides pleasant shade even in the midday heat and to the beach it was actually only a 2-minute walk (around a small church). There Dionis had prepared 4 loungers for us  which we could place in the shade. We could swim completely undisturbed  it was a fantastic  quiet private beach. The landlord was very eager to support us in all wishes and concerns  was always available via WhatsApp. So  despite the high season  it was very straightforward to borrow two mopeds and thus explore the surroundings. Thank you for this relaxing holiday   we really enjoyed it with our sons (16 11)!! Translated from German  Show original
45812728,Robert June 2021 The hosts were very friendly  helpful and quickly and easily available in case of questions. The location can't be beat! Very quiet and very close to the (own) beach. The house is functional and very well equipped. Here you can also cook for a few days yourself. We sat outside every evening and enjoyed the quiet location. A car is necessary due to the location. But in just a 5-minute drive you can reach several large supermarkets. Translated from German  Show original
45812728,Nicole April 2021 Dionysis is a great host and made us feel like home! We had to stay for just 2 days due to flooding in our house  but for those planning to come on a vacation to the island  I highly recommend staying here  the house is literally located by the sea! Translated from Greek  Show original
45812728,Crisa April 2021 Incredible location !!! Delightful host!! Fantastic house!! Very clean !! Safe selection!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
45812728,Sofia April 2021 Perfect for having peace of mind. Great place and amazing hospitality  you really feel right at home. I'm going to go ahead and try it again! Translated from Greek  Show original
45812728,Katerina April 2021 The location is perfect for relaxing. In the midst of nature  two steps from the sea. The place was so clean and tidy. The owners were very helpful  they had a prompt response for everything I needed. Overall  it was a great experience! I would highly recommend Aleca's House! Translated from Greek  Show original
45812728,Τινα April 2021 Great hospitality  an amazing house  by the sea  I could not have found better. Paradise!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
45812728,Δέσποινα April 2021 For work I took the trip to Lefkimmi. The house is on the sea with a stunning view  spotlessly clean  the host was very welcoming and helped me a lot with the routes and as many times as I needed it he was willing to help me. I definitely want to go for a refreshment. The place is for total relaxation! Highly recommend! Translated from Greek  Show original
51273261,Tom October 2022 We had an amazing vacation  the house met all our expectations and more. We had a very inviting and pleasant reception. the pictures do show the reality.

51273261,James September 2022 Great villa with all the amenities
51273261,Pantelis June 2022 A wonderful place with high luxury standards and privacy.! We stayed 3 nights and we were total 6 persons. The Villa is recommended for vip’s and families that searching for luxurious stay and privacy. All the areas were extremely clean and well decorated. As our business demands strong internet connection we found internet services extremely good without facing connection issues. A fantastic view in the island from the top floor as you can enjoy it with a wonderful jacuzzi. Huge storage in all private rooms with all luxurious installations.! Stamatis was our hostess who guide us from the first moment we arrive untill our check out. He was really kind and helpful and his response was immediate in all of our requests.

32009832,Aleksandra October 2022 The lady was super friendly and helpful  she make a cake for us. Because of the big storm we Lost electricity and they help us quickly. House is small and dark but for this price is all you need.
32009832,Traian September 2022 Very welcoming place to stay. The host was helpful and kind.
32009832,Christina September 2021 We had a wonderful 6-day stay in the quiet village of Kanakades! Marina is very hospitable and quick to answer any questions. The house is spacious with a full kitchen which made it easy to cook meals. The village is quite secluded so having a car or scooter to get around is definitely necessary  but it's very tranquil and the people are friendly. An authentic experience  we definitely recommend it!
32009832,Mia September 2021 Marina's place was lovely  we arrived at short notice with no problems  clear communication on our arrival and the personal touches of homemade cake  local wine  and some home grown vegetables were really appreciated. We enjoyed our stay in Kanakades  a small village full of local people. The views were nice but we didn't spend much time at the house in the day time. The house was as expected  and we managed fine here. Would visit again. Expect curious kittens and cats to come visit you wanting attention  and probably food! All in all  enjoyable to stay here.
32009832,Ilinca August 2021 Had a great and relaxing time. The house was not very big but it was clean and had everything we needed. It’s in a very quiet place  in a small village where we probably were the only tourists. Having a car is a must. There is a nice garden where we relaxed in the evenings and played with the neighbor’s several cats. We were delighted by Marina’s welcome and all the local delicious treats she gave us  like vegetables from her garden  local olive oil and wine. Recommend it.
32009832,Diana July 2021 A house in a very quiet village. Very friendly locals. The house has only one neighbour on the side and anouther house in the back. The only noises that we heard were the ones made of our children. Tha house can be small for a family and certainly has some challenges for young children (steep and narrow stairs  cut and unpolished tiles in the yard  where our older daughter (3 5 y) even cuts herself an the leg and we had to go to emergency  wasps  during the time we stayed there). The yard compensates for the size of the house and during the evening it’s very nice to can use the yard  because it becomes a cooler place  after the heat during the day. In the bedroom it is very hot during the night  if you do not turn on the air conditioning. You definitely need a car if you stay there. From the square  where you park the car  you need to walk a few steps to the house (100-200m).  The village store  from the square (and close to the house) can offer you the necessary products in case of quick needs and the people there are very friendly.
32009832,Johan October 2020 This is a lovely place in a beautiful and quiet environment. The house is very clean and has all practical confort. The host receives her guests in a charming and warm way. An address that I can highly recommend.
32009832,Richard September 2020 The place is great. With beautiful garden  fully equipped kitchen  comfortable bedroom  will provide you great base for nice stay. As somebody has said it before- car is a must. Beautiful view on mountains  straight from front of the property. And just 7km! from beautiful Paleokastritsa beach and plenty others. Silent.. and silent. Just go for it.
32009832,Mateusz September 2020 If you decide to stay in Kanakades you'll be probably the only tourist in town  which is rather unique feeling in foreigners-filled Corfu :) Despite the town is placed off the coast  it's still a very good point to access main spots like Paleokastritsa  beaches down the coast to the South or even Corfu city. The house is very quiet  with a nice small garden to enjoy meals outside. Interior is well maintained and actually feels more spacious than it might look from pictures. Marina provided us with some welcome treats like tomatoes  grapes  home made pie and wine  which was very nice. If you're staying on Wednesday or Saturday don't miss the BBQ in the main square  especially Saturday's kotosouvli (portioned pork on a spit) is absolutely delicious :)
32009832,Peter August 2020 If you are looking for a tranquil Corfu getaway  look no further. Kanakades is the most charming Corfiot village where you can sip coffee under a tree in the church square every morning and mix with the locals over a beer by evening. Marina's place is very nice  clean and boasts a stunning view. Her provision of home-grown food was also a lovely touch.  If you are staying here  hiring a car is a must!
32009832,Ilona July 2020 I'm in love with this place. The small village Kanakades is a very atmospheric place  with a lovely people greeting you and smiling even when see you on the first time. Marina is a super host  very attentive and friendly  I touched by her attitude and delicious homemade treats. The villa is very nice and cozy  fully equipped  so yo have everything necessary for life. The location is very attractive because it's very close to all the main sights. Looking forward to coming back to this nice place again!
32009832,Yanaki January 2020 We visited the place for New Year and even that this is off season for Corfu  it was very nice stay. It's clean and cozy and we spent lovely time here. We'll definitely visit again
32009832,Romana September 2019 It is perfect location for visiting a lot of the best beaches near by this place of course by car. People were really nice and helpful in every situation. Marina cooked for us a Greek food. It was amazing. I recomend this place on 100%.
32009832,Maryna August 2019 It was so enjoyable to stay at Marina’s place - the house is not big  but it’s got everything you need for living - the most loved ones are large bed  AC  kitchen to prepare some breakfast and own cozy yard. When we arrived  Marina shared a delicious pie for us and left some local vegetables and fruits in the fridge - super hospitality:) By staying here one can also enjoy the beauty of small Greek town with aesthetic houses and olive and fig trees everywhere:) Co-host Spiros communicated with us on arrival and was also very friendly  thank you for comfortable stay! Would definitely recommend:)
32009832,Gerbine August 2019 Great place to stay  we loved the food that Marina made for us. People in the village are very kind and you can join the Souvlaki evenings at the square if you like. Parking can be challenging  because of the small entrance at the house  so I recommand to park your car at the square.
32009832,Saleem June 2019 Marina's place is a must go. The experience I've had is nothing less of extraordinary. If you want a quiet trip  this is the place to go. Plus Marina bought home cooked food multiple times  fruit(it was absolutely amazing!). Also the people were so nice. Just one tip  if you do go here make sure you have a car with you as public transport isn't as easily available and taxis can be expensive. Otherwise  I definitely recommend this place. Thank you Marina for being so nice and so hospitable.
32009832,Mary June 2019 Great quiet place in Corfu. Very close to Paleokastrisa as long as you have a car! The hostess brings homemade food  and is at the front door if you have any questions. Fantastic!
32009832,Agnes May 2019 Marina's place is perfect if you want to have a relaxed holiday without the touristic masses. The place was very clean  the shower hot and the surrounding nature amazing.
32009832,Andrius April 2019 Great place. Good location. They met us at the airport and showed the way to the house. It was very nice and clean  Marina brought us local food. Great hospitality  we are glad that we chose this place. Thank you.
32009832,Katja April 2019 Our host Marina was really friendly  brought us Greek traditional food sometimes and cleaned the house once for us. Spiros on the other hand was the person to contact for any questions and he even picked us up at the airport. He also made us a good offer for car rental.  The accommodation was even better than portrayed on the pictures. It's a tiny house in a really small and quiet village. Everything is renovated  modern and clean. The kitchen is big enough to cook great meals and the terrace big enough to dance on. Good facilities and nicely decorated.  In total we are really happy  we found this apartment. Best greetings to Marina and Spiros 🤗
32009832,François October 2022 Entire accommodation  very cozy  fully equipped. Very quiet  if you need a break from city life.  Marina the owner welcomed us with a good chocolate cake  some fruit from the garden and eggs from the chicken coop. Spiro recommended a really affordable car rental agency for the 11 days stay.  If you want a good holiday  you can rent this place without a second thought.  P.S. You can even adopt a small cat! Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Cécile July 2022 We had a lovely stay at Marina's. Kanakades is a nice quiet little village and everyone is welcoming. The accommodation is well-equipped  I would recommend it. Thanks to Marina and Ektoras for their warm welcome. Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Mael April 2022 Small house in a small village away from more touristy places but very well located. We enjoyed the sun in the garden  the village coffee and easy access to many other places... Welcome with several small touches. Thank you! Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Tilda March 2022 Amazing hospitality  in a very beautiful house with a lovely garden  located in an amazing spot of Cyprus. Translated from Greek  Show original
32009832,Thomas November 2021 Very beautiful little house in the picturesque village of Kanakadas  fully renovated  sparkling clean and with all the necessary kitchen/appliances. This is a must for all transfers to Cyprus. Mrs. Marina is very friendly and always willing to help  and Mr. Spiros (co-host) is a great communicator and professional. Suggested for peace and relaxation away from the crowds of the city-without good care! Translated from Greek  Show original
32009832,Alexandros July 2021 Good location depending on what you plan to do in squirrel. you definitely can't go without a car we wanted to be somewhere central  from this village it doesn't take more than an hour to go anywhere on the island the city is 25 minutes away. The place is good and the price is definitely good. The sofa isn't much if you're intending to make a bed  the wifi and all the appliances in the house are in good condition  we did not have any problems with the residents of the village. Translated from Greek  Show original
32009832,Michał September 2020 We're really happy with your stay in Kanakades. Everything was as expected. Tiny house  clean  fully equipped with all the necessary utilities. A lovely garden with sun loungers  a table and chairs for morning coffee  and evening wine next to a lemon tree. Great value. Kind and hassle-free hosts. Spiros helped rent a car and pick us up from the airport. Marina was very welcome and welcomed us with regional delicacies. Great place for people who plan to rent a car for the duration of their stay. We plan to return here:) Translated from Polish  Show original
32009832,Neslihan November 2019 Lovingly decorated  but old house  unfortunately smaller than expected. Marina baked us something and prepared homemade wine for us. Terrace nice to sit outside and enjoy the weather  however there are many free-roaming cats  allergy sufferers should be careful. Showering is a bit complicated  as there is no mechanism for the shower head  ventilation is also problematic. The mattress was uncomfortable  good sleep was difficult. Translated from German  Show original
32009832,EmilioAngela October 2019 The place is a little small but equipped with everything. Great location to reach one of the most beautiful beaches. Excellent hospitality  Marina has prepared for us very good typical dishes also jam made by her . To return! Translated from Italian  Show original
32009832,Lisbet September 2019 Beautiful little house perched in a small village in the heart of the island of Corfu. Small inn/friendly shop at Vassilii's 200m away  beautiful view  beaches not far away  very nice golf 5 minutes away. And not to mention Marina's hospitality and Greek hospitality. Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Adrien September 2019 Very welcoming host  Marina provided us with local products (wine  tomatoes  eggs...). Very thoughtful Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Bruno July 2019 The apartment is very good  a little dark but since we live outside no problem  the small touches are great  marina in the middle of our 10 days came to clean and change the sheets  great and the really nice calm even the villagers are all smiling . Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Thibault July 2019 Very nice stay  Marina and Spiros were very responsive. The vegetables from Marina's garden as a welcome gift were very good. Kanades is a small village on a hill where you will find a grocery store/bar in the square next to the church. Translated from French  Show original
32009832,Pauline May 2019 Marina's place is a simple but very loving place to stay in a charming village just in the hinterland. The amenities are more than sufficient. The hospitality was great. We were welcomed with loving homemade Greek delicacies. The hosts were always available for questions and information. A great place to stay if you are looking for some peace and quiet away from tourism and some originality to Greek culture. Translated from German  Show original
31276040,Nina October 2022 The wooden house is a cosy cocoon with everything needed inside and easy to find as well. It's not too far from the city center and the airport and you can easily travel by car from there to the rest of the island. Christine was exceptionnally away when we were there but still very available by messages. She was really kind and gave us good advices for places to visit. I highly recommand to stay there !
31276040,Alison September 2022 The little wooden house has everything you need for a relaxing break in Corfu. It was charming  clean  comfortable  close to the supermarket and bus stops to town  which also made it a great base in which to explore Corfu.  Christine and family were very friendly and were on hand if needed  but also very respectful of my privacy- thank you :) As a solo female traveller I felt completely safe  being in the grounds of the main house and especially with my new furry friend- Sandy (the main house pet!)
31276040,Yvonne September 2022 Lovely house. We really enjoyed our stay with Christine who is a welcoming and helpful host.
31276040,Jelle September 2022 Lovely place!
31276040,Mose August 2022 A wonderful stay! Christine is a fantastic host. I would definitely stay in this place when visiting Corfu
31276040,Boris August 2022 The house was lovely  roomy and really cozy  It had everything it needed. The host was extremely helpful and communicative  she made our stay more comfortable  definitely would recommend this Airbnb.
31276040,Arkadiusz August 2022 Once upon a wooden House is a small and cozy house. Well-eguipped  perfectly-designed house that is kept by Christine. She is a nice friendly Host that is always in touch when it's necessary. For me everything was perfect and I recommend the place everyone.
31276040,Lorenzo August 2022 Christine is a very kind host willing to help you out during your stay and provide you with suggestions to have a memorable holiday in Corfu. The place comes with all the essentials you’ll need and is very close to Corfu old town  however I personally retain it should be taken into account by couples mainly rather than groups of 3/4 as the living area downstairs is quite tiny once the bed-sofa has been laid down. Good experience overall
31276040,David August 2022 Very thoughtful and friendly host. The tiny house is something special  it has a nice and cozy flair. We loved it.
31276040,Gabriel July 2022 We had a great stay at this Airbnb. Christine is a very kind and helpful host  she gave us a lot of advices and was always checking up on us to see if we’re alright. The Airbnb is a cute tiny house  it’s very cozy and you can find everything you need. There are a lot of restaurants  bars and supermarkets around and you can go to the city in less then 10min. We really enjoyed it
31276040,Enzo July 2022 Christine is a great hostess  she helped us since we first booked our stay in Once upon a wooden House  the little wooden house is not only in a practical location next to the bus stop and super market but also really close to the airport and best of all in the backyard of her own home  so you can already know that you will feel safe during your stay. She was extremely kind to let us have a late checkout since no other guests were expected the day we left   and we can not thank her enough for the gesture  especially since our flight was late that day. We highly recommend.
31276040,Alexandra July 2022 We enjoyed our stay a lot! The appartment is such a sweet & beautiful place to be. It was all great. We can fully recommend it! :)
31276040,Lilli July 2022 We had a really nice stay at Christina’s little House! We really enjoyed it and would absolutely recommend it to everyone!

31276040,Niels June 2022 Great place to stay in Corfu. Nice house with good privacy. Very good bed with good shower. Nice locatien near Corfu town. Christina is a very nice friendly host with good advice/tips for the island.
31276040,Lydia May 2022 The little wooden house is a perfect base for exploring the Northern part of this beautiful island. Located 5 minutes from the airport and 8 minutes from the old town. The house is so cute and comfortable  especially the bed! Christine is a wonderful host and looked after us very well. Would highly recommend :)
31276040,Kira Maria April 2022 We had a really good time in Christines place! The tiny house is perfectly located  if you want to discover Korfu by car. Close by is a bus Station  however  mostly the bus timetable was not that reliable  therefore I would definitely advise to rent a car. Although the wooden house is close to the airport  it is not really noisy. So dont worry about that! Thank you for having us  Christine!
31276040,Patrick April 2022 The stay at Christine’s place was great for our week in Corfu. Christine was super helpful and always reachable when we had questions or needed anything. She helped us find a car rental and lent us her bikes on another occasion. The city center is close by and you can reach it in five minutes by bus  although you might have to wait for it a bit ⏱  Thanks to Christine for everything!
31276040,Alexandra April 2022 This is the perfect place to stay if you want a little getaway place. Christine is super nice and helpful about the area as well as getting around. I would highly recommend staying here it is so cute!!!
31276040,Mack October 2021 Great little cabin  very comfortable and spotless. Christine was very helpful whenever we needed something even stopped to offer us a lift when we had been shopping. Give us a lift into town when going out for an evening meal. Jimmy her husband gave us 10% off at his restaurant and a couple of free shots on our final night. Only downside was no Kettle so we had to boil the water in a pan for a cup of Tea lol.
31276040,Pegah September 2021 Christine was an adorable host and provided us with everything we asked for. 10/10 for the communication! The woodhouse is a small and cozy place to be and we could reach any place on the island easily (by car). Enjoyed our stay and had a lovely time on Corfu!
31276040,Aslı September 2021 Our stay was really enjoyable  everything was exactly as it is shown in the listing. The house was very clean  the bed was pretty comfortable. We loved the small eating area outside  it was really lovely. Kitchen was sufficiently equipped  all the basic cooking gadgets and ingredients were available  including coffee pods. Location was good  multiple supermarkets and a bus stop as well as an amazing bakery were all within 5 minutes of walking distance. Christine is an excellent host  she was extremely helpful anytime when we need. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and we would absolutely book again and suggest it to others❤️
31276040,Katharine August 2021 Christine goes above and beyond  her hospitality and thoughtfulness were so incredible!!!
31276040,Claire July 2021 We spent a nice time in Xristina’s wooden house. Place was very clean and Xristina very helpfully
31276040,Illia July 2021 Cozy wooden house with a great host and really close to everything you might need  yet quiet!
31276040,Marleen July 2021 We had a wonderful stay in Christine's apartment. It is very cute and everything was clean and as seen on the pictures. Since the location is not directly in the middle of the town it is very quiet and calm. With a rental car you can go everywhere on the island and visit all the beautiful beaches. Thank you for the great time!
31276040,Christian October 2020 We very much enjoyed our stay at the Wooden House  which was an excellent base to start exploring Corfu  with all the amenities nearby to get you on your way comfortably.  Lovely  unique house  clean and beautifully presented. Christine was very welcoming and helpful.  The cat  kittens and friendly old Labrador were very cute and endearing too.
31276040,Matina September 2020 A great place to stay very clean  hommy and quite. The location also was very good because is close both to the north and south side of the island.Christina was always available for me with tips and reccomendations.
31276040,Karolin September 2020 Christine is a wonderful host and such a lovely person. She was always available for support and great tipps. The accomodation is a real cute and central spot - we always felt very comfortable and safe. Enjoyed our stay. Thanks 🙏🏽
31276040,Michael September 2020 A very nice place to stay when visiting Korfu. Christine was very hospitable and had some helpful tipps about the island. 🇬🇷😎
31276040,Jimmy August 2020 When we first stumbled upon this woodenhouse on AirBnB  it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Christina is the most thoughtful  gracious host. She provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs. The bed is comfortable and also the bathroom and loft are excellent. Location is incredible. Christina had excellent beach and restaurant recommendations and was of great help.She went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable. Thanks Christina and Corfu for a wonderful weekend!
31276040,Monique July 2020 We stayed for one week in the wooden house and are really happy about our time there! The house is comfortable  with lovely details and central located. In 10 minutes with car you are in Corfu town. We explored the northern and western part of the island with car and we really appreciate the car! But because of the central location  it should be no problem to use the bus. Christina was always there for every issues we had and also for advices! Although the kitchen is very rudimentary equipped  you can ask Christine for everything and therefore it is no problem to cook little meals. We were glad to be Christines guests and would recommend this house!
31276040,Tibor July 2020 The woodenhouse in Kanali satisfy every expectations of yours! Comfortable  clear and calm  I just recommend it for everyone.
31276040,Daisy September 2019 Christine was very accommodating and sweet!
31276040,Annie September 2019 Great stay once again! Super host and great accommodation :)
31276040,Annie September 2019 Excellent space and very stylish. Lots of thoughtful touches such as products in the bathroom and Netflix! Very kind host who offered to pick me up from the airport. .. that was well above what I expected. Great experience :)
31276040,Kate August 2019 Very cute little cabin that was clean and felt very safe. The only slight downside is if you have to go to the bathroom frequently during the night the ladder can be a bit scary in the dark. Christine was welcoming and always available for help!
31276040,Rianne July 2019 We really enjoyed our stay at this airbnb. The wooden house is perfect for an holiday in corfu. Christine is a great host who makes sure that you have everything you need.
31276040,Emily July 2019 Lovely space and easy to get into Corfu town! Quiet and clean.
31276040,Maxime July 2019 Beautiful and cosy accommodation. We enjoyed our short trip in this wooden house. The host was very helpful and reactive. We recommend it !
31276040,Angela July 2019 Christine is a wonderful host and made our first visit to Greece fantastic! The space is ideal for 2 and has a nice couch if there are 1-2 more guests. The place was so clean and she had everything you can think of that you may need. This was very helpful as we are on week 2 of a 3 week European vacation. We slept so well each night. The air conditioning really works—unlike so many others we encountered in other parts of Europe. The location in the city is good. You are close to Jumbo which is a store that has it all! And the best part is there is only one Jumbo so it helps when trying to navigate. You tell a cab driver you are near Jumbo—and they know exactly where to take you! There is excellent food nearby at Souvlaki Bar and Nosos for dessert and breakfast. All within walking distance. We use Airbnb all over the world and this one is a top pick for us!
31276040,Marine June 2019 Christine was the perfect host: helpful  generous and highly reactive! We couldn't have dreamed of better conditions to discover Corfou city!! The wooden house is absolutely lovely: you can find everything you need inside (including Netflix)  and spend some great time.

We definitely recommend this accommodation!

She is also flexible with check-in and check-out time  which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for our stay and also very closed to Corfu town.Christina lives just opposite so best thing was that she provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around!!!
31276040,Alekos April 2019 It was literally a great experience staying at the woodenhouse.The house was superclean and full equipped.So close to the city of Corfu and many things around in the area big supermarket cafeteria and grillhouse just around the corner.Xristina and her family were really helpfull throughout my stay.5 stars all around.Hopefully i’ll be back again..
31276040,Ioannis April 2019 Christine and Jimmy are perfect hosts. They came from airport to pick us up  they informed us about everything at the area and Corfu. The wooden house is beautiful and cosy. The house is fully equipped  fast Wifi and Netflix movies. The area is quite and it has cafes bakery pastry Jumbo superstore and is near Corfu Town.Too bad we stayed only one night  next time we will stay more for sure. Thank you for everything Christine and Jimmy!

31276040,Christiane October 2022 Christine is a wonderful host who always offers her help and gives you valuable tips.

31276040,Yeliz September 2022 The location  cleanliness and communication with Christine were impeccable! The Airbnb is very nice and has a lot of little cute touches.

31276040,Julian June 2022 Our stay with Christine was simply fantastic. The small wooden cottage is cozy and lovingly furnished and offers enough space for 2 people (also for longer stays). From the accommodation it is about 10 minutes by car to the old town. In general  the location is optimal for exploring the island by car.  Christine is an absolutely friendly and helpful host who was always available for questions and was very concerned about our well-being.  We felt very comfortable and welcome  would come back anytime and can highly recommend the place! 😊🏡 Translated from German  Show original
31276040,Sabine June 2022 I had a great time at Christine's place. She is very caring and wants you to be well. I felt very comfortable with her as a host. For example  she brought me water from the supermarket  asked for laundry that she can wash for me  etc. She can also organize a good car rental.  The house is very cozy and has everything you need. It stands in the backyard of an apartment building overlooking this one. The Stast is a 30-minute walk away. By bus in 10 minutes if you understand the timetable😀. The location is perfect for exploring the island. If you are looking for a small beach in 15 minutes drive  I can recommend Faliraki Beach.  The Woodenhouse and Christine are highly recommended 😊 Translated from German  Show original
31276040,Maria May 2022 The house very close to the center of Κέρκυρα about 7 min by car. Generally quiet the area with parking across the street where the Jumbo are. Kristina is excellent and always available to answer any questions! Translated from Greek  Show original

Translated from Greek  Show original
31276040,Tobiás October 2021 We had a lovely time in the wooden house. It's in the backyard of an apartment building and resembles a tiny house. Cozy furnishings  a kitchen corner and the bed at the top of the duplex. It takes 10 minutes by bus (comes every 20-30 min) or 15 min by car to get to the city. Modern bathroom  nice sofa and a good restaurant around the corner (Sti Sessoula). I would recommend this place for couples! Translated from German  Show original
31276040,Mara August 2021 We felt very comfortable in Christine's wooden house and found an ideal place on Corfu. It is cozy and quietly located in the spacious garden and is a retreat to relax (also well air-conditioned). Christine is the hospitality in person and took care of us very lovingly and with great tips. We stayed there for 17 days and can only recommend it to anyone. Numerous shopping facilities  as well as nightlife  are all within walking distance or a 10-minute bus ride. We have returned happy and rested. Translated from German  Show original

2290664,Martin July 2020 Thank you to the great host! Direct view to the very nice beach (perfect for childs)  not much tourists (corona?). Just half of the house without garden. All equipment available  takes time to cook  but works. For me the beds are very hard  but everyone likes it different. We would book again :)
2290664,Omer August 2019 This a e is just perfect! Right on the beach. Super clean and spacious. We loved the balconies to the beach and the host was super helpful and friendly. The beach itself is so great we didn't even bother exori g other beaches. It is gorgeous  quiet water and shallow. You can choose if you want to relax on tbe beach or in the water or go extreme with water sports. Really perfect. We will definitely be back. Response from Christos August 2019 Thank you for your great comments! Looking forward to see you all again in the near future.
2290664,Kirstie August 2019 Antony welcomed us when we arrived and showed us round the property and explained a little about the local area  nothing was too much trouble. There was a bottle of wine and coffee for the machine when we arrived - very much appreciated. The apartment is 2 minutes walk from the beach and there are 2 or 3 tavernas along the beach. We didn't have a car for the week we were there but there is a walking trail to another beach (and taverna) in one direction and if you walk up the road there are loads of other places to eat and Pelekas is only 1 hours walk away with stunning views over the island from the Kaisers Throne viewing point. We had a truly relaxing week and Antony was readily available to answer questions anytime. Response from Christos August 2019 Thank you for your great comments! I am looking forward to see you all again soon.
2290664,Mark July 2019 The location of this apartment can’t be beat and the beach is fantastic. Anthony is a great and personable host. He even brought some local Greek cake for our son on his birthday. We were very happy with the whole experience!
2290664,Jody July 2019 Amazing location
2290664,Andrey June 2019 The house stays very close to the amazing sand bitch. It is close to supermarket and restaurants (about 5 minutes walk to 3 places). The house has big balconies on each floor  air condition everywhere  good WiFi and nice kitchen. The only thing to note is that stairs to the second floor quite steep. In 5-7 minutes drive is Pelekas  old village with a few more place to eat and old streets to walk through. Hosts are friendly and open people  we had perfect communication with them.  Definitely recommend.
2290664,Xiujuan June 2019 Perfect location  really beachfront  beach is also nice   sandy beach  so perfect for kids. House is also nice  we spent a perfect holiday here.
2290664,Linnhe May 2019 11/10 ! from check in through to check out nothing was too much trouble  really lovely people and hands down the best Airbnb hosts we have ever met. We stayed for 4 days  staying for longer you might appreciate a hire car but the beach and local area was perfect for a short stay. Absolutely stunning scenery and a beautiful sandy  beach  very safe for kids.
2290664,Stuart September 2018 Anthony was a great host who met us  showed us around the apartment  and even lead us to a trail that took us above the beach. This trail ended up being the gateway to many beautiful hikes that we took during our stay. Thanks  Anthony! The apartment couldn’t have been in a better spot-steps from the beautiful Glyfada beach  close to markets and restaurants. We were three adults and the space felt very roomy for us. Beds were comfortable. Linens were good quality. The kitchen was amply equipped. Two balconies with beach views were amazing! There were indeed beach umbrellas along with floats  bodyboards  and even buckets and shovels for kids. I highly recommend this apartment! Don’t hesitate to stay here!
2290664,Christian And Brittany September 2018 This home is at the best beach we experienced while on Corfu. The water is shallow and crystal clear  perfect for swimming. The beach is sandy. The home itself has everything you need  is tastefully designed and clean. There is a very charming town just a short drive away with many restaurants and one of the best views of the island. The host was incredibly kind and cheery  making us feel welcome and offering us great recommendations. We definitely recommend this home and hope to return in the future.
2290664,Susanne September 2018 Had a lovely time Anthony was a great host very helpful with local suggestions of things to do helped us hire a car and arranged a taxi to the airport  The place was clean and had everything we needed   perfect location we loved sitting on the balcony looking at the sunset   would love to come back next time in Corfu
2290664,Helmut September 2018 Perfect as ever. Thank you very much
2290664,Luca August 2018 Dear Christos and Anthony  we want to thank you for the amazing week in Corfu. Pelago House is the perfect accomodation for a Family with 2 Children. The house has upstairs 2 separated bedrooms and the bathroom   downstairs you have the fully equipped kitchen and the Living room. You live directly on the beach  you just need to walk 50 meters  plant your sun umbrella ( provided by Christos ) and that's it. We met Anthony and he is very good host : Always available but never pushy. If you Need Information for good Restaurant or Sightseeing ask Anthony for  he will help you. It was our first but surely not our last Corfu visit and we will come back to Pelago House. Monica  Sofia  Elena  Luca Response from Christos September 2018 Thank you very much Luca for all the great comments! It was truly a pleasure having you and your family as my guests. Looking forward to see you all again next time you are in Corfu. Anthony
2290664,Paul August 2018 The appartment is really lovely and the location is great  right by the beach. The place is cleaned every 4 days and clean bedding & towels are also provided at the same time. We had a little problem with finding the appartment as there are 2 entrances - make sure you head for the main entrance and the reception. Anthony is a lovely host  very helpful and friendly. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us on the arrival as well as some water and juice for the children. Anthony was in touch during our stay in Glyfada making sure that we have everything we need. He also recommended some very good restaurants and trips. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and had a great holiday. We would definitely recommend this place and  if we ever return to Corfu  we would love to stay there again. Thank you Anthony for being a great host and making sure that we have everything we need. Aga  Paul  Oscar and Jacob. Response from Christos August 2018 Thank you guys! It was a great pleasure having you around. Please come and visit next time you are in Corfu. Anthony
2290664,Hana August 2018 We have been to Anthony ´s place end of July and beginning of August. The place is very clean  very nice. There was nothing we ´d miss in the equipment of the house ( if we stayd longer  I ´d miss a washing machine but for 10 days it was OK without). It is on the beach  really 2 minutes walking and you reach the sea. It is wonderful. The children were in heaven. If we come back it would be in June or September with less people around  at the period mentioned the beach was overcrowded. Anyway the place is great and Anthony is a very plaesant  helpful and communicative person. We fully recommend! Response from Christos August 2018 Thank you very much for your kind comments. You were great guests and you are always welcome here. Once again  thank you. Anthony Show more
2290664,Schul July 2018 Best Holiday Ever We are a family with two children  and till now we always had our holidays in all inclusive hotels  till this year  when we decided to try this wonderful house. And we never regret it. First  I have to tell you  that is a lot more comfortable than a hotel and you have all the freedom you want. On arrival  we were welcomed by our wonderful host - Anthony - who took us around the house and showed us everything. He welcomed us with a bottle of wine  and juice for the kids. When he found out that I liked beer  he even brought two beers for me - thanks again :). Now let me tell you about the house. The location is great  just a few steps from the sandy  wonderful beach  where children can play all day long - as the water is not deep and is crystal clear. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you might need during your stay  and is very clean  with everything being functional. The living area is spacious and has a cosy couch  TV - which we did not turn on during our long stay  and a big terrace with a wonderful view  where we used to have our meals - still missing my morning coffee :) Upstairs  there are two bedrooms and a bathroom. The master bedroom also features a terrace with a great view. The beds are comfortable and the sheets and towels were changed regularly. The closets are big and there is a lot of space for your clothes. In the nearby  there are few tavernas and shops  but you must take Anthony's advice on great tavernas to eat at and places to visit. I sure hope I had covered it all  as much as I could. Anyway  I think no words can express the way we felt - as it was fantastic - and Anthony made it all possible. We got richer with great experiences  great talks and wonderful people. We would definitely go back anytime. Once again a big THANK YOU  and hugs from Romania.

2290664,Louis October 2017 My family and I have used airbnb many times and I must say that this is one of the best. Anthony was the perfect host. Very easy to communicate with and was very informative on places to see and things to do while in Corfu. The home had everything you could possibly need for a perfect stay including a amazing view of the ocean from both patios including a beautiful sunset each night. The beach is honestly a 10 second walk from the front door and very relaxing and fun for kids. Would definitely recon to rent a car so that way you can see all of the great beaches and old corfu town. Our host gave us locations to visit and with our rental  we were able to get there in no time or hassle. Response from Christos October 2017 Thank you very much Louis for all the great comments! It was truly a pleasure having you and your family as my guests. I hope the rest of your holidays went well. Looking forward to see you all again next time you are in Corfu.  Anthony Show more

2290664,Vladimir July 2017 Spending our vacation in Christos's place is truly pleasant experience. Apartment is big enough for our family of five (two adults and three kids age 15  11 and 2). It has large living room  fully equipped kitchen  two wonderful terraces with beautiful sea-view  nice bathroom and two large bedrooms. Apartment is very close to beach which is sandy and nice.

2290664,Daniela September 2016 This appartmant and its location is just amazing. If you want to relax  listen to the sea wherever you are in the flat  enjoy a beautiful beach just in front of your balcony - book this place. It is very cosy  clean and private. Nearby  you have small supermarkets and few taverna. And a very great beach bar. The hosts are very kind and responsive  they welcomed us personally very late at night. Just great!!
2290664,Martin September 2016 Everything was OK  apt was nice big and clean with fantastic view and the sea was almost under the balcony and Anthony is real host - in touch and very helpful.  Eva  Maria and Martin  Slovakia
2290664,Andreas August 2016 The apartment was as described  in a very convenient location for the beach and with its own parking. It was impeccably clean  and the host was very welcoming and went the extra mile to make sure we are happy. I usually try to list some negatives  but I am struggling to find any in this case...
2290664,Tim August 2016  This apartment had everything we were looking for and more: our host was extremely welcoming and helpful; the accommodation was even better than we expected: the balconies were beautiful; internet access was superb; aircon was useful at nights and the location had a great beach and lots to do in the area. Lidl's near Corfu town was a cheap way to buy food so you could stock up on the way over from the airport. The restaurants in Pelekas were great  particularly Pink Panther (pizzas and view) and Jimmy's (great food and welcome). The Kaiser's Throne is a short walk above Pelekas and is a must for the view over the island; go at sunset and eat in Pelekas afterwards!
2290664,Shirley August 2016 We absolutely loved Anthony's apartment  the beach is just outside your door. Anthony greeted us with food  a bottle of wine and the warmest caring personality that put us right at ease after a long day of travel. The apartment was clean  modern with an amazing view of the beach. We received clean towels throughout our stay which was amazing. The apartment and the beach is exactly as the pictures describe. Anthony was always available with information and suggestions to make sure our stay was relaxed and happy.
2290664,Annapaola July 2016 Our holiday was simply perfect.  The apartment is fantastic: well furnished  in a very nice residence and perfect location! The beach  few steps from the apartment  is sandy  the water cristal clear and is quiet  especially if you walk to the right end. We especially enjoyed the balconies  both of them front to the sea  where we enjoyed our breakfasts and lunches.  There are some very good restaurants nearby (3-5 minutes walking)  a couple of mini markets are few steps away. We recommend also a visit to Pelekas village (5 minutes by car)  and of course  to Corfù Town (25 minutes by car). We did not explore other beaches nearby  although there are several  since Glyfada beach was really perfect for us and our kids!  We would really like to thank our host  Anthony  for his very special welcome and for making us feel at home!!! We will definitely come again and recommend this apartment to our friends.  Some things we did not know at booking time and we really appreciated: there is a bar with a free swimming pool few steps from the apartment and all our towels were changed every couple of days!

2290664,Ioannis June 2016 Superhost  always available and friendly.  With regards to the accommodation  it is very clean with great service.  Beautiful surroundings with a very nice beach club nearby.
2290664,Martin June 2016 Had a great stay in Glyfada. Christos was a great host and met us on arrival with a welcome smile. The apartment was clean and had all we wanted for our stay with 2 small kids. Would recommend.
2290664,Gerrie June 2016 Christos and Yiannis were charming and very kind hosts. Our flight was delayed and we got (very) lost missing the turning to Glyfada beach several times in the pitch black night [hint for future travellers - go to Pelekas and follow signs to the 'Lti Hotel' when you find it then follow signs to beach parking]. Despite our late arrival we were greeted with smiles and a very welcome bottle of local red wine. The duplex is well equipped and has lovely views of the crystal blue sea. Watching the magical fire flies on the starlit evenings was a special  unexpected treat.
2290664,Susanne May 2016 First of all  the host and his crew were absolutely amazing. Our plane landed late at night  yet they were so great and checked us in and made sure we had everything we needed. Christos is really quick to answer if we had any queries and made us feel very welcome throughout the stay.  The beach is literally just a stone throw from the house and the view is fantastic. Since we were there just before the season  we found that renting a car was a great way to get around  but they do have everything you'll need there if you don't want to do that.  I would definately recommend :)
2290664,Jean-Maurice August 2015 First  the amazing view  just in front of the beach. The sound of the waves  the sunset on the rocks  the location of the apartment is simply wonderful. The Menigos resort is a kind of village  with small streets (where cars are forbidden)  palmtrees  small coloured houses  very nice. The apartment is absolutely exactly as discribed  quiet  very well equiped  climatization very efficient  with the so so nice welcome of Anthony  very careful about our wellness all along our stay. Something great  the private parking place  so nice after a long day driving along the fantastic Corfu roads. Glyfada beach is a very pleasant place  with shops and bar very closed to (you must have a drink at Pazuzu Bar at night  so cool...). Sand beach  finally rare on Corfu island  water warm as well. If you love beach holydays  don't hesitate to come here. But that would be sad if you don't discover the island with all its treasures : Paleokastritsa  the north-east coast until Kassiopi  Achileo Palace  Corfu City (day and night)  and Pelekas just close to the resort  with the amazing view of the Kaiser's Throne and all the excellent food of the traditional tavernas. We totally loved our stay here.
2290664,Kiren August 2015 Anthony is a absolute star. He is a great host. The apartment is both beautiful and spacious . He had a bottle of wine and cold water in the fridge waiting for us and was always around if you needed anything. I had a headache and he brought me by some Paracetamol a bit later for example. The beach is sandy and long. The far end is quiet if you want a more relaxed feel. There is a few restaurants and markets very close by to choose from and all the staff are very friendly. We enjoyed some lovely sunsets from our 2 different balconies and some great family memories. I would highly recommend this apartment and Glyfada Beach. Anthony is the best.
2290664,"Grant July 2015 this was our first air bnb experience. i wouldn't say we were nervous about it  but like any first experience you want it to go well. every time we checked in with christos or anthony their response was immediate  so before we even arrived in corfu we felt like we were being looked after.  the apartment is exactly as it is described  on the beachfront at glyfada beach. it was just my wife and i so the apartment more than accommodated our needs. it's two story  with a kitchen and large living room downstairs and the two bedrooms upstairs. there's A/C throughout and a balcony both upstairs and downstairs to take in the views.  anthony met us on arrival and could not have done any more to make us feel welcome  including the offer of a lovely bottle of greek wine. he lived close by and made it very clear to us we could contact him for any need. this is extremely reassuring when you're away from home.  glyfada itself offers all you could want. it is set up as a tourist beach - plenty of sunbeams and umbrellas as well as water sports and activities. in chatting with some of the waiters we got to know in tavernas there  it seems it's not as ""touristy"" as some of the other beaches on corfu and is more popular with the greeks than anyone else. there are also quieter parts of the beach where you can swim and sit on the beach without feeling like you're part of the throng. this suited my wife and i and best of all  it was the part of the beach pretty much out in front of the apartment.  there are a few mini-marts on the beach and one decent market selling all your usual needs. there's a good taverna at the right end of the beach and a few more along the main beach front. note this is not the place to come to if you want clubs or late night partying. there is a new taverna just next door which has only been open for a month or so. it pretty much dominates the beachfront both day and night. during the afternoon it tends to play dance beats to accommodate the younger crowd. by 8pm those beats are off and the vibe completely switches to chill. the restaurant here is the priciest on the beach  but the ambience is something else.  we had a great time on glyfada and would not hesitate to recommend anthony and christos as hosts.

2290664,Dimitris July 2015 The house was great. It is more perfect that it seems to the fotos. It is in front of one of the best beaches of Corfu very near to supermarkets taverns and beach bars for every taste. If you want your privacy you can find it also. Antonis  the housekeeper was great. He was waiting for us when we arrived even we got late to the house. Whenever we wanted him  he was there for us solving everything came up. Thank you Antonis for enerything.
2290664,Alex July 2015 AMAZING EXPERIENCE! My 4 girl friends and I couldn't have asked for a better weekend! We booked Anthony and Christos's apartment about a week before going to Corfu  and were extremely impressed by Anthony's helpfulness  kindness and going above and beyond anything we could have asked. He gave us clean towels every day  answered every question and even had a bottle of wine and water waiting for us :) The air conditioning was wonderful  beds were made and the apartment was new  clean  and fully furnished which allowed us to cook lunch and dinner! The beach was beautiful and it was super conveniently located right next to a bus stop that takes you right to the airport and Corfu town. There are also two markets  multiple great restaurants and beach bars and a pool in the resort  so we never felt the need to leave! We rented paddle boats for a few hours and saw caves and places around the coast- so I would definitely recommend doing that! All in all  an exceptional weekend! Response from Christos July 2015 Thank you very much for all the great comments! It was truly a pleasure having you as guests.
2290664,Mykhailo July 2015 Great location with a very good services (cleaning up  changing towels  etc). A very comfortable place and area with all needs provided. Pictures of home are 100% real. Good attention and support from owner regarding any request.
2290664,Katy July 2015 We had a great time at the apartment in Glyfada - literally a stone's throw from the sand and sea but quiet and relaxing. The apartment itself was spotless  spacious and comfortable. The balconies are roomy and the perfect place for breakfast in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening to the sound of the waves crashing. The sun was out all week and the sea warm enough to just walk in. Anthony was unbelievably helpful and kind  and made our stay perfect. We hired a car and explored the island a bit  but found Glyfada was the perfect base and both felt this was the most relaxing holiday we have ever had  which is just what we came for. There was a new bar/restaurant which had just opened on the beach that week whose food and cocktails were superb. Thanks so much - we would recommend the apartment to anybody and would definitely come again!
2290664,Mike June 2015 The apartment on Glyfada beach was excellent  just what we needed for a quiet and relaxing start to our Greek holiday. It was attractive and roomy (over two floors)  had all services ( cooking  refrigerator  freezer  TV) and was cleaned and supplied with fresh towels and laundry every three days. The sandy beach was 3 minutes walk away. The sea water was clean and refreshing. There's a local bus which takes you to Corfu Town at regular times throughout the day. We hired a car locally (180 euros for 6 days) which is necessary if you want to see more of the island. The attractive hill-top village of Pelekas provided local tavernas and bars. Christos answered our queries quickly and effectively and the experience was great from start to finish.
2290664,Nelly September 2014 We had a really wonderful stay in Corfu  much thanks to the apartment we lived in. It was right on the Glyfada beach  with a perfect sight on the sea  that is on 2 min. walk. The kitchen  living room and the two bedrooms were very spacious but yet cosy  equipped with everything that we needed. The garden around was beautiful. The apartment was cleaned every second day and we had as much towels as we wanted. The hosts were easy to reach and very helpful each time. They show us Soon we started to feel as at home and didn't really wanted to leave. My husband  out 21 years old daughter and me  we all would like to come to this place again.
2290664,Daria September 2014 Very nice apartments near beautiful and comfortable beach. Amazing view! We would like to return.
2290664,Andrew August 2014 A perfect getaway. Ideal for young families through to seniors. Beautiful beach and a real home away from home. A first class host with whom nothing is a problem. Book it now as you will not find better. Response from Christos August 2014 Thanks Andrew. I am really glad you and your family enjoyed your holidays. Hope to see you all again sometime.  Best regards Anthony Show more
2290664,Hannah July 2014 WONDERFUL STAY! The apartment was absolutely beautiful and had one of the most spectacular views of the ocean I had ever seen! It was clean and spacious and cool (due to the incredible balconies off the living room and master bedroom that look out onto the beach). The kitchen was awesome and ended up cooking quite a bit. The food at the resort was delicious and so was the iced coffee concoction they had. Beach was clean and beautiful with clear beautiful water. At night it was quite  serene and beautiful. Anthony (Christos' cousin) was a ROCKSTAR! So easy to get in touch with  friendly  helpful  nice and went out of his way to make our stay easy  comfortable and fun! I cannot recommend this listing enough. It was fabulous! Response from Christos July 2014 Thank's Hannah  It was truly a pleasure having you and your friends around. Please come and visit us again whenever you are back in Corfu!  Best regards Anthony & Christos Show more
2290664,"Oliver July 2014 The host is a very kind and helpful person. He provided new towels and cleaned the flat regularly. He helped me as translator in a garage when my car had problems  showed us the good taverns and was always ""a phone call"" around. The flat is on a very preferred location as it is one of the closest to the beach. Even though the door is at the backside of the house  it takes 1 (one !) minute to get the feet in the water. There is one of the open air ""resort- showers"" on half way to the beach  and in every day life  it gets essential when it comes to keep the sand out of the flat. At each floor is an about 7m2 balcony with an undisturbed view over the beach. Each floor has one AC device  we rarely used them  the nights were cool enough. The kitchen has everything you could ask for  except a dishwasher. We cooked very often at home. The flat is furnished in a very tasteful way  not comparable to the usual ""diposable"" holiday flat furniture. A massive  ""as new"" leather couch  many solid wood items  many pretty decoration items. It survived our 3 children.  The master bedroom has a pretty double bed with about 1 90m by 1 40m . I am > 1 90 but I could easily stick my feet through the bars at he end. The children bedroom had 3 single beds (one came extra) and is designed suitable for children. The bathroom is from the eighties  but full functional and has hot water at any time ! The resort WiFi is free  a bit annoying at some times  good enough for daily mail checks.  The neighborhood   mostly greek flat owners(?)  is very quite  there are no disco taverns or endless loud beach parties around. No car noise. Only the noise of the breaking waves that can actually get pretty loud depending on the weather. No noise when the balcony doors are closed.  A fixed parking space is assigned to the flat at about 100m  and we could drive to the flat door for unloading.  The beach itself: without being an expert this was one of my very best beach experiences ever  and the best experience with children ! Water at 24 - 25C  crystal clear  almost no stones  no jellyfish  dirt or whatever  about 20m to get waist - deep. On some days  the waves that can get strong (and great fun!)   the children should be able to swim  mine are 4 - 6 - 8  with one eye on the smallest it was OK. The beach wasn't crowded in front of the house (in July).    Show more Response from Christos July 2014 Thank you Oliver for your kind words. I hope your journey back home went smooth. I really hope to see you all again in the near future. Please come and visit us whenever you're back in Corfu.  Best regards Anthony & Christos Show more"
2290664,Matthew June 2014 Great apartment kind host and fantastic views. Everything was perfect.
2290664,Elody July 2021 Very well located apartment with beautiful sea views. Very large and very pleasant sandy beach. It is possible to settle there for free (using the umbrellas made available by Anthony  it is essential in summer in Greece) or to rent deckchairs on the few private beaches (the cost varies from one beach to the other but is very reasonable). Anthony is a very friendly and available host. The apartment is very good for enjoying the beach  but you have to know that Glyfada is lively during the day with beach bars and restaurants  but it is very quiet in the evening  this is perfect for sleeping and resting because there is no nuisance. Those looking for more entertainment  it takes a car to go to Corfu (20 min). Translated from French  Show original Response from Christos July 2021 Thank you for your kind words Elody. I hope to see you all again soon.  Anthony Show more
2290664,Daniel September 2019 Very nice and cozy house (almost) on the beach. We were there for a bathing vacation and the house is great for that.

Translated from German  Show original
2290664,Felix May 2018 The stay was very pleasant. Christos was very concerned about our well-being. It is a small terraced cottage in a resort. In the pre-season it was very quiet and pleasant. Towels and bed linen would be changed several times  the apartment was very clean. Noise from the sea is plentiful:-) Translated from German  Show original Response from Christos May 2018 Thank you very much for your lovely comments and for staying with us. We are very happy you had a great time. We hope to see you all again in the future.  Best regards Anthony & Christos Show more
2290664,Svenja August 2017 The location of the apartment is really amazing. Right on the beach with 2 balconies to the sea (great view)  especially from the upper balcony. Despite the high season  the section in front of the apartment was not crowded  but rather pleasantly empty. The apartment almost feels like a house. Directly on the ground floor are the kitchen and living room and the stairs lead to the upper floor with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.  The key handover worked out just fine and Anthony gave us tips on the surroundings. When we asked for a lounger for the beach  he spontaneously brought us 2 plastic chairs for the beach. That was great!  There were even 2 parasols available  which were also urgently needed in the orientation of the beach without natural shade.  We will be HAPPY to come back!  THANK YOU!

2290664,Dorothee June 2017 It was a wonderful week in a very nice apartment in a fantastic location  2 balconies overlooking the beach 20 m away. The apartment is spacious and equipped with everything you need for a nice holiday  everything was wonderfully clean. Although we were at the facility 4 hours early  Christos came immediately to hand us the keys and showed us everything. My son had forgotten his cell phone in the bus  we told you this. Christos immediately had a phone call and we were able to pick up the cell phone at the bus station. Thanks again for that!!!!! The place is a bit remote  but even without a rental car it is easy to reach the public  air-conditioned bus. The beach is fantastically beautiful  there are 3 souvenir shops where you can also buy the essentials of food. We had a great  relaxing week and hope to be able to vacation there again soon. Highly recommended  Christos is a great host!! Translated from German  Show original
2290664,Nikos April 2017 Very nice house with comfortable spaces at the best beach of Cyprus. Contacting hosts was seamless.

48908445,Pascal October 2022 All hosts should take example on Zeus Throne resort and Vasilis. All the staff are welcoming  happy to see you and what’s to do always more for your satisfaction. The junior suite is exactly as expected and even better since when you open the fridge and there’s a plate of fresh fruits   wine   beer   water and all kind of soft drinks. The beach   the grocery store are 15min walk away and also the breathtaking trail for porto timoni beach is directly next to the room ! There’s a lot of restaurants and tavern all around. Our experience was over expectations we highly recommend and will return for sure.
48908445,Sophie October 2022 They were so helpful  accommodating  kind and overall great hosts! Would 100% recommend and have already to friends and family. Pictures do not do the suites justice with the pool and sunrise view from the bed. Also directly next to beautiful Afionas old town and the nature park with the stunning beaches (track is through the restaurant area only 15min walk). Breakfast was also plentiful with lots of choice and could order to the room. Can’t wait to visit again :)
48908445,John October 2022 My wife and I began our two week honeymoon in Greece at Zeus' throne. There in the village of Afionas we found a piece of paradise. One of the few regrets we have as we're wrapping up our two weeks is that we didn't spend more time in Afionas. The hospitality of you  the staff  and the quality of the experience exceeded all expectations.  Thank you to you and your staff  we'll be back!
48908445,Rachel September 2022 Wow wow wow  what a fantastic place. Accommodation was awesome  pool and views over the bay are amazing  you could stare at it all day long. Staff are brilliant  so friendly and cannot do enough for you  even sorted our transfers and arranged quad bike hire for us. Breakfast was great  plenty to choose from and food in the restaurant was also really good  can even have it brought to your room. Basically our holiday was made to feel really special.  Cannot recommend this place enough  wouldn’t change a thing and we will definitely be back 😁
48908445,Maddie September 2022 Clean  modern  fun suite with an incredible view and unmatched hospitality from Mario & Kostas. Welcome drinks  fresh fruit & a well-stocked fridge upon arrival. Beautiful pool area. Located in the cutest old village. Beware the extremely narrow roads to reach the resort  but once you’re there  everything you need is walkable. Fabulous breakfast included and homemade desserts available at the restaurant just steps away. During our September visit  the wasps were plentiful — if you’re afraid of them like I am  bring wasp spray.
48908445,Gerrad September 2022 The pool room was spectacular. Lovely staff.
48908445,Laura August 2022 Phenomenal. The photos don't do the view or the place justice. We literally just lounged in the pool and egg chair for the entire 4 days of our trip!
48908445,Daniel August 2022 Zeus Throne is absolutely stunning. The views alone are worth the price but the room and facilities themselves are also great. We felt well looked after and have no complaints at all. The property is in Afionas - which is beautiful but a little out the way  a car is needed if you want to explore more of Corfu. The drive into the actual property is a little hairy with a few tight squeezes  but once you reach the property it is all worth it. Food is good  staff are friendly  property is well taken care of. Would heartily recommend
48908445,Paula July 2022 WOW!!!! What a place! From the moment we arrived we were made more than welcome!!! We were greeted with a chilled glass of Buck’s Fizz on the restaurant terrace with the most amazing view! The suite was very tastefully furnished with a fabulous shower and a very comfy bed! A fridge with Greek sparkling wine  rosè and white wine  beer  soft drinks  water  chocolate and a fresh fruit platter!!!! The private balcony was out of this world! A small pool  super comfy sun loungers and a swinging chair hammock  perfect place to chill! The restaurant staff were amazing  extremely attentive and very professional! Breakfast and dinner was all made fresh to order and was exceptional!!! Afionas is the most prettiest village we have found in Corfu which a hand full of fantastic restaurants! I can highly recommend Zeus Thrones Thank you for making us so welcome!!!!
48908445,Constantinos July 2022 Zeus Throne is exactly and better than the pictures. Vasilis is a wonderful host. Our stay was fantastic in every aspect. We highly recommend a stay here!!
48908445,Laura June 2022 Our stay at Zeus was by far the most amazing place we have ever stayed at! The room was really lovely and clean and the bed was super comfortable. We were blown away by the views from the private pool - surrounded by the mountains and overlooking the sea  it just doesn't get better than that (even the photos can't do it justice).  All the staff at Zeus were so friendly and accomodating and made our time so special. They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and that we were having a good time. The fridge was stacked full of free treats including some bubbly and we had a lovely fruit platter and welcome drinks on arrival.  The food along with the service at Zeus Throne's resturant was incredible  we ate here mosts nights as there were so many tasty and affordable options. (you also just can't beat the view). I definately recommend the fresh sea bass. The breakfast was also delicious  there were so many options and it kept us full all day. A massive thank you to Mario who was so lovely and always made us feel like a friend rather than a customer.  The location was perfect as it was right next to the picturesque town of Afionas and a few minutes from the viewpoint where you can see an incredible sunset. It was also only a 20 minute walk down to Porto Timoni beach  where the sea was incredibly clear (make sure to do some snorkeling). We would also recommend wearing trainers on this walk as it is a bit rocky.  We highy recommend booking here  you will not be disappointed. We already can't wait to come back again! Show more
48908445,Brad May 2022 Beautiful room  spectacular staff  amazing views  and great food! Couldn’t recommend this place enough! Plenty to do and see within a short drive of the village  otherwise the accommodations were perfect and kept us busy and relaxed.
48908445,Ann May 2022 Vasilis’ place genuinely surpassed all of our expectations. The room is amazing - including a fridge full of treats/wine which are all included. The view is incredible as you can see from the photos! I can’t speak highly enough of the staff - they went above and beyond to make our trip so relaxed and perfect. The breakfast is great and food in the restaurant is phenomenal (particularly the tzatziki!). So much so  we ate here every day of our 5 day trip. My friend and I were so delighted with everything and will definitely be returning.
48908445,Sebastian October 2021 My first all 5-star review and more than deserved  Views: out of this world Location: literally above the hiking trail of one of the most gorgeous beaches in Corfu.. Staff: cannot emphasise enough what an amazing staff they have all the way from waiter to the cleaning lady 😊  10/10 would recommend
48908445,Jonatan October 2021 We really enjoyed our stay! Great hosts and service. The twin bays and Afionas village were both within walking distance by path  both offering amazing scenery and beaches!!
48908445,Jess October 2021 Absolutely beautiful Airbnb! Very thoughtful touches in the suite and loved getting to have breakfast on the terrace in the morning. It couldn’t be more perfectly situated to hike Porto Timoni and come back for a cold beer and swim. We loved every minute!
48908445,Sandra September 2021 Very friendly and helpful staff. Apartment was very clean and beautiful sea view. I recommend! 😊 Perfect place for holiday.
48908445,Tatiana September 2021 This room does not disappoint and is exactly what you see in the photos! It has everything you need  it’s super clean and the views are incredible! We loved our stay here  Vasilis and his staff are all fantastic and super hospitable and we would definitely re-visit. I would also say they make the best chips in Corfu!
48908445,Meenakkhi September 2021 The Zeus Throne Junior Suite was visually spectacular and looked even better than the pictures. From the sun loungers to the private jacuzzi  from the automatic curtains to the mesmerising view  everything about this apartment oozes class.  The views from the apartment are incredible and the sun loungers and egg chair were incredibly comfortable. The cold jacuzzi/plunge pool was very refreshing on the hottest days.  All the restaurants nearby were delicious (we had a fantastic meal at the Zeus Throne restaurant itself) and the streets of Afionas itself were very picturesque (do not miss the Afionas sunset view just around the corner from the suite!).  Vasilis and Mario were always helpful especially when ordering the (included) breakfast which arrived fast and straight to the suite. Ordering a taxi was very simple and they managed to order one for us at short notice. The suite was cleaned daily and towels replaced and made for a very comfortable stay.  Overall  we would really recommend this apartment! Show more
48908445,Sarah August 2021 Don’t think twice about booking Vasilis’ suite. We booked this place because it is the most affordable hotel with a private pool on the island but we got so much more than we expected. First off  the suite is brand new so everything is modern  fresh and up to date. There are so many thoughtful touches in the apartment such as the curtain that closes by the bed so you’re not woken up with the sun and the shower that has 4 different options (i.e rain shower  spout for your feet after a sandy day at the beach  etc.). The suite is quite large to feel comfortable even for a few days! It is the size of many apartments in New York and Amsterdam. Second  the pool and view are absolutely stunning. It was lovely to have the option to wake up and go right into the pool  cool down in the pool after hiking from Porto Timoni beach or sitting on the lounge chairs to read while looking out at an amazing view. Third  the location is just fabulous. There are tons of restaurants nearby including Zeus Thone’s own restaurant  a great sunset look out point  a beach nearby to rent a boat for the day  a couple of hiking options and a village to explore. You could easily spend a few days here without going to any other part of Corfu. Lastly  the staff and service is impeccable. Vasilis  Mario and the rest of the staff made us feel at home. They were attentive without being overbearing and gave us the utmost privacy and help. You will be so full from the free breakfast included; the portions are large. If you eat at Zeus Throne’s restaurant  get a grilled fish and grilled vegetables! (FYI the road to the hotel is narrow and can only fit one car. Sometimes when we were driving in and out  I’d get out of the car and walk ahead to see if another car was there  then signal to my husband that he could drive through.) Show more
48908445,Kenny August 2021 This spot is incredible. Absolutely breathtaking view with a 20 minute hike down to a beautiful beach. Elegant private pool and nice  clean space with just the right amount of amenities. We were treated very well from the moment we arrived through to our departure - kind  considerate  and generous. If you are visiting Corfu  I highly recommend this listing.
48908445,Eileen August 2021 We went to Zeus Throne to celebrate our 35th anniversary   so we wanted a special place and boy  did we find it. The Junior Suite is beautiful and perfectly appointed. The private pool space is heaven. Every review says ‘exceeds expectations’ and we totally agree. The only thing better than the accommodations is the quality of service. Vasilis and his staff are attentive to every detail  and address every guest request. Whether advising on things to do arranging activities  or finding taxis that otherwise don’t exist  they get it done. Finally  Afianos has five great restaurants. We got to four of them. Our Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews are coming  but although Dionysus (the Zeus Throne restaurant) isn’t quite as fancy as the other three  the best three meals we ate in Afianos (Gilthead Fish  a Weakfish special  and the Zeus Salad) were at Dionysus. And the in-room breakfasts were exceptional.
48908445,Stacia August 2021 This place is perfect for a holiday at the beach - the suites are exactly as you see in the pictures  the food and service is just what you want when looking for a relaxing vacation and the location could not be better. I cannot recommend this place highly enough! We'll be back.
48908445,Johanna July 2021 We really enjoyed our stay with Vasilis! We booked the Suite as we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and it really was super nice! Loved having our private pool with the best view on the bay! :-) The breakfast was great as well and the option to have it served either at the restaurant or in the room was really nice! The food at the restaurant is delicious  reasonably priced and the staff is very accommodating! The last stretch of the drive to the hotel is a bit rough (tight  steep roads)  but the location makes it worth it! Only a short 20-30 minute hike down to Porto Timoni beach so you can easily beat the crowds in the morning. We would definitely recommend staying here!
48908445,Ishita June 2021 Vasilis was so hospitable and the property was so much more beautiful than we could have imagined. The view from the house was stunning and the food from the restaurant was great! Can’t recommend this place enough!
48908445,"Marion September 2022 The hospitality and views are exceptional. The accommodation is clean and very well arranged. We just regretted that the hot tub is behind the sunbeds because in the pool it's impossible to see the sea and we only see the back of the sunbeds. On the other hand  when booking we felt that we were going to be alone in the world (in view of the photos) but there are apartments with terraces just above and next door so no privacy or tranquility. This is not a unique place but a small ""zeus throne"" residence in Afionas with different types of accommodations. So we found the value a little disappointing. On the island there are other quieter accommodations with private pool and magnificent views for less. Translated from French  Show original Response from Vasilis October 2022 Hello   thank you for your concern although the listing says it is a suite in an aparthotel. Most of our guests this year were couples for honeymoon & famous influencers who found the perfect spot for this holiday . It is not a villa somewhere in the woods with no one around   our place is on the cliff of Ag Georgios with sea view right on the path of porto timoni beach and that's makes it special Show more"
48908445,Alexis August 2022 Room above a restaurant  perched at the top of a mountain. Very nice view and very nice room. Be careful to park if you come by car as there is only a small parking lot (that of the restaurant) so avoid meal times. Breakfast is taken at the default restaurant  the staff are very kind and attentive to your needs. You can ask for breakfast in your room and I would recommend it because there are a lot of wasps on the terrace which spoils the view and the meal. Likewise  there are several wasps on the outside of your suite. It's not visible in the photos but there is still a lot of overlook on your terrace  neighbor standing (measuring 1.90 m I could see perfectly in the neighbors) terrace of the apartments above you with a direct view of your deckchair. I'm happy but the last small warning if it can save you from having  in the morning an employee passes from terrace to terrace to clean during the pool  put your deckchairs back  etc. Only small downside  it has a direct view of your room (very large veranda) and unfortunately we were changing when it landed on our terrace.

48908445,Fabien August 2022 Excellent stay. It's as shown in the photos.

48908445,Walter July 2021 We had booked the suite with our own private pool. It's a completely new suite  it was all perfect. From the pool you have a unique view directly into the bay of Agius Georgius. Certainly one of the most beautiful views of all of Corfu  the view simply captivates. We were welcomed with a large  delicious fruit plate  the fridge was lush with drinks. Breakfast was great. Here all wishes are fulfilled  freshly prepared and served finely on the terrace with the wonderful view. The juices are freshly squeezed  the omelets of all kinds freshly made  yogurt with honey  the fruit plate  the egg dishes and everything else that belongs to the perfect breakfast is served in a friendly way. Even the coffee is of Italian quality. We really loved it here every day. The same terrace is the in-house tavern in the evening. The food there is more than recommended. The food selection has pretty much everything here  including all the Greek classics. The Moussaka was really the best we've ever had (and we've really been to Greece many times)  even the desserts here are exceptionally good. We suggest the homemade cheesecake. It's truly worth a culinary sin! Those who book here can look forward to a wonderful vacation  by the way  it is only a few meters from the hotel to the picturesque streets of Afionas!

34026826,Laura October 2022 My stay was wonderful - I felt looked out for and looked after.  Giorgos came to give me an umberella on a day it was raining and checke di had what I needed.  Great value for money 😌
34026826,Марина September 2022 The apartments are quite far from the beach  but for people who walk a lot  this is not a problem. The room is simple and clean. There is a terrace outside where you can have breakfast in the fresh air. A spacious yard for parking cars. In the area where the apartments are located  mobile Internet does not work well. But there is Wi-Fi in the room. A two-minute walk to the supermarket. In general  we have no major comments about the accommodation.
34026826,Vanesa September 2022 Giorgos he was very kind and helpful. he was able to welcome you with great joy and also advise you on places where you can visit in corfu. The apartment has everything you need. The position of the place is great because you have the market near a restaurant crossing the street that is delicious and the beach La grotta that is really near by walk  also a few bars for some cocktails night. A big thanks to Giorgos.
34026826,Francesco July 2022 the time in paleokastritsa was awrsome thanks to the apartment of Giorgos placed in a really good Place to visit anything
34026826,Joana July 2022 Giorgos is a very nice host and take care of its guests. The room was great for a week and the location was perfect as the bus stop is just outside the building. I really enjoyed my holidays there!
34026826,Megan July 2022 Had the best week in Corfu with my partner  great convenient accommodation and great location! Lovely restaurant across the road Response from Giorgos July 2022 My friends I'm very sorry I was not there when you left to thank you and say goodbye. I was very happy to meet you and I wish you all the best. Health and happiness. I will be very happy to meet you again sometime in the future. Show more
34026826,Aleksandar June 2022 host was super accommodating and helped me with all my queries. Paleokastritsa is also the most beautiful place on the island.
34026826,Maximilian June 2022 Giorgos is super helpful and kind. Highly recommend staying at one of his studios.
34026826,Lauren June 2022 Giorgos’ place was a great find in Palaiokastritsa! The host was very accommodating and welcoming  constantly checking in with us and answering our questions quickly. The Airbnb was very centrally located — only a 8-10 minute walk to the beach! Spiros Taverna  a Greek BBQ restaurant  was also right across the street. Our only complaint is the bed was a little firm  but everything else was good!!
34026826,Sara June 2022 Beautiful  quiet spot and set back from the road. Small group of pretty apartments with a stunning backdrop of the mountain behind. Giorgos was super friendly and helpful  and couldn’t have made us feel more welcome. Great for walking up into the hills through the olive groves or down to the beach.
34026826,Ashley May 2022 Giorgos' place was absolutely lovely. Perfect location  has everything you need for a comfortable stay as a couple  and was great to have access to a BBQ. Giorgios' communication was really good and he helped with anything we needed. I would even say the pictures don't do the location justice - right opposite a taverna and just a couple minutes from Acapulco bar which we spent loads of time at (off the beaten track and private beach access!) Would definitely recommend this place.
34026826,Sumalatha May 2022 Giogos is a lovely host! I worked remotely for a couple of days and he went above and beyond to accommodate me! it's also a really great location!
34026826,Petra April 2022 Everything was appropriate. The host was very helpful and kind.
34026826,Louise April 2022 Very good location  nice room and very helpful host! I can definitely recommend this place!
34026826,Sophia April 2022 Giorgos is a great host :) He asked us everyday if we need anything. He is friendly and helped us a lot. The location is great and it is easy to get there by bus from Corfu Town. Everything was 10/10 :)
34026826,Nicole October 2021 Giorgos Vanilla studio was perfect  good located  very clean and had everything we needed. Giorgos was a great host and we had the best experience  we would for sure come back!
34026826,Firat September 2021 Dear Giorgos  we enjoyed our stay in your place. Giorgos was really friendly  carefully and mindful. We recommend everybody who wants to make holiday in Paleokastritsa.
34026826,William September 2021 Beautiful and comfortable. Even if the bedroom/kitchen/bathroom are small  the outdoor space gives you plenty of room to spread out. Giorgos is super helpful and kind. Location is convenient without being too central  and plenty of amenities are within a short walk (grocery store/bakery & cafe). I can’t imagine a better place to stay in Paleokastritsa.
34026826,Adrian September 2021 A great place. The owner was very nice and helpful. It's very clean inside. I recommend this owner. We will be happy to go back there.
34026826,Maëlle August 2021 Very nice place to stay in Paleokastritsa  very clean  Girogios is nice and thoughtful. We really enjoyed our stay.
34026826,Ella August 2021 A very sweet little apartment. Perfect for a couple  close to bars  restaurants and the beach. Giorgos was kind and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed.
34026826,Ana-Maria July 2021 Me and my friend had a short but very nice stay here  in Corfu. Giorgos is a great host  very friendly and he pays attention to the guests needs. The location is about 10 minute walking distance from the beach. Also  the Market and the bus station are nearby.
34026826,Andrii July 2021 The place is nice  suitable location  close to the beach  taverna  bike rents. Kindly and communicative owner.
34026826,Guusje July 2021 Giorgios was such a great host  very friendly and relaxed. We had a great time
34026826,Gunnar July 2021 Thoroughly recommended!
34026826,Paula July 2021 Well kept villa. Taverna and bus stop opposite and supermarket 2 minutes walk away. We had a car for access to all the pretty bays  but spent most of the spare time at Acapulco bar. Best place on the island. Just 5 minutes away.
34026826,Krzysztof June 2021 If you like hillwalking in a quiet and colourful seaside mountain range  if you then need to get some swim in the late afternoon  but if you don't need a posh hotel to stay  than the Giorgos' place is the right choice. It's conveniently located  nice and clean. You can pick a fresh lemon at the backyard  have a chat with the host  or pop out for a dinner or just a pint to a taverna across the street. That accommodation is a real bargain for openminded and active people who enjoy something more than just holiday partying or all-inclusive vacation.
34026826,Tom October 2020 Oct 20 - my wife and I stayed 2 weeks at Vanilla and it was a wonderful experience. Giorgos is possibly my favourite ever airbnb host  so kind and attentive but never overbearing. The apartment is very sweet  pink and green and cosy and has everything you might need from a supermarket and taverna just over the road to a kitchenette and coffee maker etc inside. It isn’t the lap of luxury but it is clean  honest and all you could ask for at a great price. Some people might want to hire a car or moped to get around. We were happy to walk along the fantastic coastal road  exploring the many coves  tavernas and bars  the rockpools  and the sandy beaches on foot. The bus to Corfu Town takes 40 minutes from right by the apartment and runs regularly there and back several times a day. Note that we stayed off season and during Covid - with that in mind we found the local shops and people wonderfully helpful  generous  safe and considerate.
34026826,Fio October 2020 If u looking for a familiar and easygoing place to stay in Korfu the Vanilla is the best for u. Giorgios is the best host  I've ever met. Friendly  easygoing  sociable and just lovely. He care about us everyday; u can feel like home. The location is perfect starting point to see all island. But also Paleokastritsa is very beautiful town. Big five for Giorgios
34026826,Mariann September 2020 Giorgos is a very attentive and kind host  he took great care of all and gave us a very good feeling during our stay. The accomodation is nice but simple  a very good value for money though. The village is quiet - the accomodation is lying in a street with restaurants  a supermarket and some further lodgings. The accomodation itself is part of a small and pretty house with further studios - we were lucky with the other guests nearby  as everyone respected the silence and privacy. It might happen that you'll share the terrace with other guests when you want to sit outside though. Giorgos and his family are very lovely people  we definitely felt comfortable and would come back.
34026826,Ana September 2020 Giorgos place was such a great find. Absolutely stunning location with easy access to the beaches. I definitely got the relaxing holiday I was looking for  everything was excellent and Giorgos is one of the nicest  friendliest hosts I have ever encountered. I hope to be back one day.
34026826,Javier September 2020 Giorgios was the best host. We arrived very late at night and everything was closed. We were starving and he prepared a Greek salad for us  it was very very kind of him. The studio is very basic but it got everything you need. The ubication is magnific  very close of the interesting spots.
34026826,Pawel August 2020 The room was very simple  however  it had most of the things we needed. The AC worked properly  there is a parking place on the property and the check in was very smooth.
34026826,Rene August 2020 Very nice place near the beaches for a small price
34026826,Sergio August 2020 Giorgios Is one of the most kind host that i ever meet: he was careful about all of our necessities and our health  He's very hospitable  an Amazing guy. The house was very clean and disinfected by covid rules; perfect for an holiday's house. We had the perfect vacantion.
34026826,Thomas August 2020 Giorgos was amazing from beginning to end. Once we had booked the place  all of his responses were very quick. We expected our room to be a little smaller and were pleasantly surprised to see we had more space than we expected. Everything in the flat worked very well including the air conditioning and the kitchen amenities. Right opposite the flat  there is a restaurant with incredible food and amazing service  we went there three times in the week we stayed! Within a 25 minute walk  you have access to at least 5 beaches  great bars and restaurants and many little supermarkets. We didn't use it but right outside the flat  there is also a bus stop. We loved our stay at Giorgos'  it was incredibly clean  had a lovely outdoor space to sit and have a drink/dinner  he checked in daily to see if we were okay or needed anything  I would highly recommend!
34026826,Radoslav July 2020 Nice accommodation with great garden and convenient location to explore Paliaokastritsa  Corfu and the north part if the island. We enjoyed our stay a lot and we had everything we needed in the room. I totally recommend
34026826,Janet October 2019 Vanilla Calm is a great place to stay  a hidden gem  situated well for those who wish to explore the area or stay in the resort without the noise and rush. On the outskirts of the town  so parking and crowds not a problem. The place is far away enough from Corfu town to make it quiet  but less than half an hour transfer for the airport and port  so an ideal location. ergo is a most welcoming host  nothing is too much trouble. There are places to eat close by  plus a few shops for essentials. If you need rest  relaxation and to recharge your batteries  this is the place.
34026826,Magdalena September 2019 I am fully satisfied! Great location and very kind  helpful host! The room was clean and cosy  with an air conditioner. Well-equiped kitchen and clean bathroom. There are also tables and chairs in the garden  so its possible to spend time outside the room. Great location - very close to many beautiful beaches and restaurants (the nearest lovely Taverna is located across the street!).
34026826,Maria August 2019 Lovely accomodation close to a wonderful sea and excellent hospitality. More than recommended!!!
34026826,Paul August 2019 Nice flat and decent host!
34026826,Lucile June 2019 great studio! the accommodation is very well placed (near transport  beach  super market) and very well maintained. The owners are adorable and available in case of problems. it is the ideal accommodation for a good holiday!
34026826,Pauline November 2022 A great location for visiting the island  with beautiful beaches close to where we can walk to. Giorgos and his wife are extremely caring and helpful. We had a wonderful stay. The accommodation is clean and everything is provided to be able to cook if needed. A real favorite for the place  no regret the west coast is really beautiful. We had a dream time for the period  sun and heat and few tourists at this time. A few shops still open for shopping nearby. A perfect stay! Translated from French  Show original
34026826,Mahmoud October 2022 The location of the studio is perfect. close to the most beautiful beaches and great nature area of Corfu.

34026826,Anna October 2022 The apartment is very cute. We felt very comfortable there! The owner Giorgios was also very sweet  you could ask him anything and he explained everything to you  and also gave tips for the vacation. The location is so nice. We also made trips to other regions  and found that Paleokastritsa is the most beautiful place in Corfu. Translated from German  Show original
34026826,Camilla September 2022 A small apartment in a strategic area of Corfu. The bus stop is a two-minute walk  a little further away there is a market and also very nice places  beaches and very good restaurants.

I was able to park my rental car right on the property  which was very convenient. Directly opposite the property is a taverna where there is excellent food  one minute walk away there is a small shop for everyday needs and the nearest beach is also only about a 10-minute walk away. There are also numerous bars and restaurants nearby. The apartment offered everything I needed for my stay  but of course you shouldn't expect luxury for the low price. However  the value for money was very good and I would choose to stay here again at any time. Translated from German  Show original

34026826,Olesya August 2019 It was the first time I booked with Airbnb so I was worried but totally in vain. Giorgos was a very hospitable and at the same time unobtrusive host. The cabin  as he described  is minutes away from the stop  you can't get lost. Cafes and a supermarket are also nearby. The house is newly renovated  decorated in soft tones  clean and tidy  there is a small kitchen  bathroom and a terrace in the garden - very cordial. WiFi is also fine. But the most important thing for me is the location! The best beaches are within walking distance (some thanks to maps.me). And if you rent a car or a bike  then it's beautiful. In general  I am very glad that I chose this place (plus the cost was different from booking and other locations  considering that I was looking for a single accommodation  and this is usually double price). Appreciate Giorgos'u and with a pure heart I can recommend this accommodation! Translated from Russian  Show original
34026826,Laurie July 2019 Giorgios is a very welcoming host and responsive to our requests. Her apartment is very well located in one of the most beautiful places on the island. There is a bus stop to get to the city of Corfu in 40 minutes right in front of the house. The largest beaches are a 20-minute walk away. In summary  rental well placed in a beautiful and quiet place  with a particularly welcoming host. Great value for money. Translated from French  Show original

23850122,Carol August 2022 Ioanna's a lovely host and my family had a great time in her little villa. Its based in a small village with a few restaurants by a small fishing port  we had a car to get around and mainly used it as a base. Beds are super comfortable  Internet coverage is excellent (no t.v  so use your own device)  pool and garden is clean and safe  plenty of free parking outside.
23850122,Hayder August 2022 The house was very clean and the garden was very nice  the swimming pool was great for a summer dip. The host is extremely nice and helpful. Even though the host shared the garden and lives next to the house it wasn’t disturbing at all  we barely saw them. There are a lot of cats that come yo the garden and they are all very friendly and cute!. Overall the experience was very good and we were comfortable as a family of 5.
23850122,Magnus July 2022 A super nice house with everything you need at your home away from home. Very close to the different beaches aroumd Petriti. And if you feel lazy you could just cook at the house and spend a day i the pool. And the hosts is super friendly and helpfull. And the cats are great. Make sure to visit the taverna that are located south of the center. We spent many days diving and reading books in the sun. Its not a party town so nice and quiet if you are into that sort of vacation. The house is very suitable for families.
23850122,Jacob July 2022 It was very nice to meet Ioanna... she was very friendly and the children loved the cake...! The area and house was very nice... the pool was an absolute hit in the warm weather. If you look for a relaxing and quit and nice place  you have found it...
23850122,Stefanescu June 2022 Very nice house  well equipt  everything you need  perfect host. I really recomend for a perfect vacation.
23850122,Sam September 2021 Petriti is a quiet  tranquil and friendly place. Ioanna is a lovely lady and her little house is both comfortable and well equipped. She has lots of little kittens running around and even though she lives there is never really intrusive.
23850122,Craig September 2021 Ioanna is a great host. Her house is spotlessly clean and fresh as well as being well appointed. Ioanna certainly went way above all expectations during our stay . She had left out everything required from toiletries to absolutely fab biscuits . I can't recommend her house and Petriti for a stay in Corfu.
23850122,Bas August 2021 Ioanna and Nikos are very sweet and helpful hosts. A very good option for your stay in Corfu.
23850122,Sinje July 2021 Ioannas Fontana is a real Soul Place to have a chill and good time. It’s small and practical  cute and comfy and it has everything you could ask for. If not  just ask Ioanna! She lives in the front house and is very welcoming and helpful. To share the garden space was more than okay  everyone had their own space  we had the pool all for ourselves. That’s a real highlight of the place  we‘ve spent many evenings in there. We didn’t have a car  but to get around the island was no problem. We immediately got in contact with reliable taxi drivers. Petriti is cute and yummy  the surroundings various. We would recommend the place to families and smaller groups and would love to come again! Thank you!
23850122,Klara July 2021 Great place  the family enjoyed the staying ! Thanks for welcoming some last minute guests.
23850122,Sonja July 2021 Nice spot to relax. House is clean with delicious welcome threat. Ioanna who lives in the same garden as well  a really sweet motherlike figure  but not in a way that it is annoying. With enough shaded places in the garden and a pool to cool. A quiet piece of Corfu with enough sea-side restaurants. Had a lovely time.
23850122,Andy October 2020 We stayed for 2 weeks at loanna’s place and had a really nice time. It is in really quiet location only a few minutes walk to the sea front where there are restaurants and bars. loanna was a lovely host.
23850122,Michael September 2020 Our stay at Ioanna's was perfect and unforgettable. We left with a heavy heart. From her lovely homemade jam  to her sparkling clean house and the very comfortable pool  we couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay. We also made friends with Loukomaki  Ioanna's cat  the cutest  loveliest cat. Thank you again Ioanna for a wonderful stay at your lovely house!
23850122,Nagy August 2020 Great host  wonderful house  excellent services !
23850122,Paolo August 2019 Beautiful house  full of every accessory and very comfortable in a small and peaceful village on the coast. Very close to the house there is also a mini market  small but that really has everything you need. We have experienced a couple of very nice weeks thanks to the hospitality and sympathy of Ioanna and Nikolas  excellent guests  very friendly and helpful. In the immediate vicinity very beautiful and not crowded beaches  both of sand and of rocks. Extremely recommended solution for relaxing and satisfying holidays. Again a big thank you to Ioanna and Nikolas for satisfying our every need. Come back without hesitation!
23850122,Yordan July 2019 Ioanna's place is in a remote (and quieter) village on Corfu. We loved it. Tiny intimate beaches are a short drive away  good restaurants are within five minutes (by car)  there's a mini-market right there. A trip to Kerkyra takes around an hour  and all your more urban cravings can be met there.  The place was clean and comfortable enough for our family of five. Ioanna was gracious and helpful.  There's only one thing which we preferred to know in advance. As mentioned  we are a family of five (one nine-year-old  and twins of three––all boys)  which by definition makes us a loud family. The above is the reason we were looking for a detached house. While Ioanna's place is a whole house it is situated within the yard of Ioanna's own house  meaning we were never truly alone. Don't get me wrong––Ioanna was charming and sweet  it's just a clarity issue.
23850122,Mara September 2022 The host is very accommodating and at the same time restrained. We didn't miss anything at the place. Thank you for the lovely stay. Translated from German  Show original
23850122,Sophie September 2022 pleasant stay in this pleasant house. Translated from French  Show original
23850122,Marie September 2022 We had a lovely two weeks at Ioanna's. The house is equipped with everything you need  we have never been able to cook so well in an AirBnb. The house is not huge for four adults  but since you are only staying inside for sleeping or cooking  that's no problem. The garden and pool are the big highlight. Ioanna lives directly on the premises but is very reserved but at the same time always helpful and hospitable. Translated from German  Show original
23850122,Stef July 2022 Wonderful stay in Petriti with Ioanna! A comfortable  quiet  fully equipped house and ideally located in a fishing village to have good fresh fish in the morning on the harbour. The pool so nice after a day at the beach or on a hot day. Thank you for the fresh juices and fruit waiting for us in the fridge  as well as the homemade cupcakes on arrival🥰 It was a nice meeting  and we can't wait to come back... I highly recommend this house of happiness! Translated from French  Show original
23850122,Charlotte June 2022 Very attentive and delicate welcome from Ionna  perfect little house in a fishing village  surrounded by wonderful beaches and restaurants! Translated from French  Show original
23850122,Michael June 2022 We had a very nice time at Ioanna's cottage. The house is lovingly decorated. The right place for a quiet family holiday with lots of privacy. It is absolutely quiet  there is no traffic in the side street. The garden is beautiful  you can sit outside a lot. Everything there  loungers  dining table  etc. The equipment inside is also very good. The kitchen really has everything you need. Enough towels  blankets  etc.  all there. Ioanna is very nice and happy to help! Translated from German  Show original
23850122,Paraskevi September 2021 The house is well suited for a family. We have nothing to fault   the owner lives on the property and is available to help and advise you. Not only were there drinks and fruit in the fridge waiting for us  but also homemade baked goods. We highly recommend it. Translated from German  Show original
23850122,Jonathan August 2020 Very nice house  spacious  clean and well-equipped. The pool is really a very nice addition!! We were able to spend a very nice holiday with the family  visiting this beautiful island that is Corfu. Ionna is a very nice  caring person who was available and flexible with our check-in and check-out times. We recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
23850122,Peter August 2018 We were the very first guests of Ioanna and her husband Nicos. We were very warmly welcomed  Ioanna was very thoughtful and helpful. The cottage has everything you need   the kitchen is well equipped. The garden is nicely laid out and you can eat outside. There are screens and outdoor shade on all windows. We also had water  fruits from the garden and homemade jam in the fridge when we arrived. We felt very comfortable and thank you again for a wonderful vacation. Translated from German  Show original
6944573,Sally August 2022 We loved our stay at Cosmos Beach House. Fantastic location and magical setting. I will remember my early morning swims for years to come. Thank you and I hope to be back
6944573,Timea July 2022 Precise  at hands helpful  kind.
6944573,Cynthia April 2022 This is a beautiful house in a perfect location on an amazing beach. We had a very relaxing time and will definitely book again. Highly recommend.
6944573,Bernd October 2021 Great responsive and supportive hosting for a wonderful location. Thanks a lot for a fantastic two weeks holiday!
6944573,Meridith September 2021 We had a very nice and relaxing stay at the Cosmos beach house! The beach is not crowded  and there are nice restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance. It is a great location to relax. George was a great host  and was very helpful anytime we asked for anything. The only con is that there was nothing really in the apartment as far as foodstuff goes (except for water where there is a filter)  and we had to buy everything. That said  I assume this is part of Covid cleaning protocol  so it’s understandable. We would definitely return to this beach house in the future!
6944573,Sven June 2021 Great place
6944573,Adam September 2020 Great place to stay for family or friends - right opposite the beautiful beach with plenty to do. Fantastic local restaurants and lovely hill walks with amazing scenery. It's a great place to come.
6944573,Logan September 2020 Can’t be the location  and our host was extremely friendly and very responsive. I would highly recommend this house to anyone visiting Corfu!
6944573,Kirsty August 2019 The most amazing house in the most special of locations. Fantastic facilities and 10 steps for the most beautiful clear bay we have visited. George was the best host ever  responsive  helpful and nothing was too much trouble  he simply was brilliant  thanks george between you and the house we had the best hols x
6944573,Virginia April 2019 The beach house is wonderful. It is right next to the beach and has everything you need during your holidays. You can be inside in the nice livingroom or outside on the balcony. There is a table and a lot of sunbeds for enjoing the sun! The house has a lot of space and is equiped with a lot of different things you may need. The location with seaview is amazing. It is in a more quite area of the island and there is a lot of nature. So renting a car is a must. But with a car you can reach everything in a short time. I absolutely recommend this accommodation!
6944573,Annika July 2018 Smart spacious and comfortable house with beautiful views. The local hostess  Katerina  is very helpful and friendly. Beautiful area with the local nearby village of Afionas a highlight as well as the local boat hire man. Sea temperature much colder than expected as the local bay is deep.
6944573,Julian May 2017 We had an awesome week in the beach house. The house is very comfortable and luxurious  looks exactly as nice as in the pictures and has everything you could wish for to enjoy your vacation. The surrounding is very nice and calm. Therefore it is an ideal place to relax and enjoy the beautiful beach and landscape. The terrace is perfect for sunbathing and barbecues as sunbeds and big pillows are provided. Katerina and George were great hosts and very welcoming. They helped us with everything and the communication was very easy. We definitely recommend a stay in this dream house.
6944573,Micheal April 2017 We really enjoyed staying in this house. The view and sound of waves at night put you right to sleep! The kitchen has everything you need to cook for yourself if you don't want to go out. Our family of four had more then enough space and privacy. We will be returning to this house in the future.
6944573,Michael June 2016 Cosmos beach house is located close to one of best beaches  I've ever seen. The water is blue and clear and there are almost no waves. You can walk out of the house  cross the small road  walk into the shallow water and start swimming through the bay. On the day of our arrival Nick was already waiting for us at the house and gave us quite a lot of information about the area and places worth visiting. He also had some food for us including local beer  fruit and vegetables and corfu honey  which is really good. The house itself is fantastic and bigger than necessary for a small family. Our daughter enjoyed having her own room. The kitchen is well equipped and the dishwasher was also really helpful. You should know that there is no TV set  but in such a perfect place we never missed it. Although not cheap  this house is defintely worth the money. We liked particularly the many flowers in the garden and around the house. The only thing a little annoying in our holiday was our flight to Corfu on Saturday morning. The small airport in Kerkyra was overcrowded  also on the day of our return. But the time we spend in this house was very relaxing. I can also recommend to google Cosmos beach house  it even has a website.
6944573,Emily April 2016 Before we arrived we received emails asking about our preferences and needs which was great. We were made to feel really welcome by Fanis and Nick . They brought us a lovely hamper of supplies and gave us great advice about the local area and Corfu more generally. The beach house has everything you could possibly need and because we were early in the season we particularly enjoyed the log fire every night. the balcony was great and we enjoyed eating outside and sunbathing with a sea view. It was very spacious and relaxing place to be.We regularly got told by the locals that we were staying on the best beach in Corfu. We had a great holiday  cheers. Response from Hostlab April 2016 Thank you for your preference and kind words. We really hope to see you again in a future visit! All the best to you al from the team!
6944573,Elena August 2015 The house was an absolute paradise. It is exactly as in the pictures. We had a wonderful and unforgettable time  full of relaxation and privacy. Fani's hospitality is beyond expectation. He is the most professional  helpful and kind host I have ever met. His attention and availability made us feel as the most VIP customers or even friends. The house has everything that you might need  from romantic candles to special puffs for the beach and all the necessary things for cooking. During our check in  Fanis had left us eggs  butter and things for breakfast along with a delicious wine. Absolute privacy  spacious indoor and outdoor places combined with proximity to all external facilities that might be needed (such as restaurants or super markets). The beach in front of the house is one of the best in the island therefore there is no need to leave this paradise for any reason. A highly recommended place with the most amazing host. Thank you Fanis for this great experience.
6944573,Alice August 2022 the house is very well designed  equipped  decorated. idyllic location on a large family uncrowded beach (mainly Greek tourism). Translated from French  Show original
6944573,Annick July 2022 Everything went well and Elena our contact was very responsive to our requests. Translated from French  Show original
6944573,Sven June 2018 Beautiful view from beautiful terrace Translated from German  Show original
6944573,Jürgen September 2017 We enjoyed the stay  the atmosphere of the house and the location are great. The spacious interior design with very nice decorative elements creates a real coziness  the two terraces overlooking the beach in front of the house are great  you prefer to spend every minute there. The care is very warm and competent. Thanks for the (unfortunately too short) great week! Translated from German  Show original
6944573,Jérôme October 2016 Very nice villa  overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. Excellent service and care from the moment we arrive  with a well-stocked fruit bin as well as jams  honey and a bottle of local wine. Perfectly accurate photos. The housekeeper comes back one morning  stocked up on towels and changes the sheets. There are shops nearby. (Grocery store 100 m away) I highly recommend the Taverna Anemos in the small village of Afionas 2 km from the villa. The village is sublime at the time of sunset. Translated from French  Show original
50911420,Roberta July 2022 The house was pretty and clean  there was everything people could ever need. There is a store nearby. Check-in went smoothly. The host is very nice.
50911420,Petr July 2022 Good spot for exploring nice beaches by car.
50911420,Lourdes June 2022 The garden is nice and pleasant. Sofia's brother who greeted us was very kind. The house is well located  and is quite basic. Not totally quiet.

50911420,Emmanuel August 2021 Great welcome  our guests were lovely  and full of good intentions. Great value for money.

50911420,Dumitrescu August 2021 Sophia and Vassilis are the ideal hosts.The house the garden  in fact the whole property are tastefully designed sophistication and elegance. They are always attentive to the wishes of the guests  while being also very discreet. They have a positive infectious energy...probably because they are very young and they want to convey to others this good stereo. I highly recommend them and can't wait to be their guests again. Translated from Romanian  Show original Response from Sofia August 2021 Thank you very much for this beautiful evaluation. We are very happy that our facilities have met your requirements.

50911420,Véronique July 2021 We had a great time at Sofia's place. Communication with her and her brother was smooth and prompt. They folded back 4 times to make the stay enjoyable. They advised us on places to visit nearby. The apartment is on the ground floor of a house and gives access to the garden  very pleasant. There is air conditioning  which is a must have in Greece in summer! Only small negative point  the shower  really small and not convenient. Basic equipment. Good value for money. Translated from French  Show original Response from Sofia August 2021 Thank you very much for your evaluation. Your feedback helps us to evolve for the better.
13277040,Tim August 2022 Kamarella Estate is a beautiful authentic Greek villa with stunning views over Corfu and a relaxing atmosphere. Corina and Maria were great and provided us with loads of information and recommendations in Corfu town and the local beaches.  Corina very kindly met us at the airport at 10.30pm and showed us all the way to the villa.  We would recommend a hire car for the beach  supermarkets and visiting Corfu town which are all within 15-20 mins drive.  On our arrival we were presented with a generous food basket  an overflowing fruit bowl  alcohol chilling in the fridge  bread  eggs  fruit juice  milk  cheese and a filo feta pie. The cupboards are well stocked with basic staples if you do fancy staying in and cooking for the odd night.  House keeping was provided halfway through our visit with fresh towels.  The pool is great and invigorating as it is fed from a mountain stream.  Thank you so much for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home. Show more
13277040,Martina July 2022 Kamarella Estate is something special - in so many ways! House full of character  the garden full of flowers and bushes and herbs  the pool full of fresh spring water  the cupboards and baskets full of small treats and amenities. We absolutely loved it here! Only a short drive from Corfu Town  nestled in green forests of cypress trees  with a small church just across the street. And despite being true to the legacy  everything is so spacious and comfortable with many small corners to enjoy a snack  glass of wine or just read a book. Although we like to explore and do things we were always tempted to just stay at Kamarella  because it was so refreshing and simply beautiful. We resisted and found that the location right in the middle of the island is a great starting point of any day trip. Whatever you decide to do  Corina is a great resource for culinary  cultural  historic and beach exploration! When you return in the hot late afternoon  you open the gate and it is almost as the temperature falls for a degree or two - this is how refreshing it feels to be there.
13277040,Jonathan June 2022 We cannot emphasize enough how special this experience was for us. The house and garden are spectacular and the pool is an example of sustainability at its finest. The hosts were incredibly generous with gifts and amenities. We would definitely stay here again !
13277040,Tom June 2022 Lovely hosts and a peaceful  clean and private* place. The pool is lovely and fresh (this will take some getting used to)  as the water is constantly being refreshed from the mountain stream. Very unique.  Corina waited for us at the airport and while we got our rental car sorted. She then guided us to the house and showed us around the house. (you will need a car)  The service overall is fantastic! Any issues were resolved quickly and we received a list of recommendations and the kitchen was waiting for us with some local treats  fruit and drinks.  *Note: The house is divided and has a top and bottom level. You will have full access to the top level and the pool and gardens. During our stay  there was a miscommunication between family members and someone stayed overnight while we were there which we didn't expect. Once flagged  it was resolved quickly.  Thanks again Maria and Corina for a lovely stay.  Some further tips: - Walk to the local Tavern Masaboúkas for a Freddo Cappuccino  beer and a Souvlaki - Eat at Psistaria Ilias in Kastellani Achillion (best Gyros we found) - 5min drive or 25min walk Show more
13277040,Jaclyn June 2022 We’ve just had the most incredible stay at Maria’s villa. Everything was perfect from the communication before we arrived till when we closed the door upon leaving. A real attention to detail  from the fruit and essentials. It truly is the most beautiful and breathtaking place to stay  with picturesque views of the mountains and the sea. A well manicured mature garden full of fruit trees and herbs and flowers alike. I can’t recommend this place enough if you want to escape city life and refresh and recharge. Thank you so much for your hospitality Maria and Corina  we hope to stay again soon! Response from Maria June 2022 Thank you so much Jaclyn for this great review. We really hope to see you again in the future! Ευχαριστούμε για όλα!
13277040,Hilary May 2022 We enjoyed a wonderful 8 days staying at Kamarella Estate (11th - 19th May). Maria very kindly met us at the airport and showed us the way to the house  pointing out the nearest supermarket etc - a car is essential. The accommodation is fabulous and spacious  it’s well equipped  it has amazing views - especially from the main terrace which is a great place for watching the sun go down. There are balconies from all of the bedrooms and beautiful gardens which are tiered down to the pool area. The pool and outside seating areas are lovely and perfect for relaxation. Maria had provided a generous welcome pack for us and both she and Corina responded very quickly to any contact/questions that we had and were helpful with suggestions for restaurants  boat trips etc  they even recommended a taxi driver one evening so that our ‘designated driver’ could enjoy some wine with his meal. All in all this was a great holiday and staying in this lovely setting gave us the opportunity to relax and escape from the hurly burly of life whilst also having easy access to Corfu Town and the lovely north western beaches. As a result our first visit to Corfu was a very positive experience  so thank you very much Maria and Corina  we hope to see you again in the future. Response from Maria May 2022 I have no words to explain my happiness right now.  Thank you so much for this lovely review Hilary  we hope to see you again in the future.  Best regards  Maria and Corina Show more
13277040,Alice September 2021 Our trip couldn’t have been better. The property is beautiful and authentic  made better by Maria’s thoughtful gifts and welcome package which included alcohol  food and the kumquat drink. The recommendations provided to us really enhanced our stay. We will remember this holiday for a long time.
13277040,Corina September 2021 My family and me had a great time at Kamarella Estate. The property is fully equipped for a comfortable stay but it’s history was preserved. We enjoyed the quiet and the green outdoors that surrounds it  while also having the city a short drive away. We also enjoyed the opportunity to get to know our very nice and kind hosts Corina and Maria  who were very easy to reach for questions and recommendations and also welcomed us with greek sweets  fruits and liquor kumquat liqueur.
13277040,Sharon July 2021 An extraordinary experience  olive trees  blossom garden  butterflies around  the amazing spring-water pool. We felt lucky to be in a place with a long family history. Maria and Corina welcomed us with everything we could wish for. Wine  Limoncello  traditional snacks  and a refrigerator full with food for the day (actually it lasted for 4 days…) A dreamy family vacation. Response from Maria August 2021 Thank you very much for your great feedback & the your lovely review. We hope to see you again here with us! Best regards  Maria & Corina
13277040,Paola July 2021 We stay in many airbnb's and we can say with confidence that this was one of the loveliest homes  with a super nice host that really went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. I think she under-sells the pool too - it's fresh water and so lovely. The house is breezy and cool  even at the height of July heat. The kitchen is well stocked and Marias was so generous to bake things for us and shop for us. We loved going for walks in the area. And yet beaches were easy drives too. Definitely recommend this home. Response from Maria August 2021 Thank you very much for your wonderful feedback. We hope to see you again here with us! Best wishes  Maria
13277040,Sebastian July 2021 We were a family of 5 staying at Kamarella Estate for a week in July. The villa  gardens and pool are really wonderful. Quiet  peaceful  beautiful views  pretty gardens  a house with lots of character and interesting but comfortable furnishings. Aircon in each bedroom  a covered balcony  a pool fed from the mountain stream. We were met at the port and followed Corina in her car to the house which made arrival really easy and stress free. A great surprise that the kitchen had already been stocked with more than the essentials so we did not have to go out and shop for a few days - I wish more Airbnb places did this as it meant we could relax rather than rush out to the supermarket. A great place to unwind with family or friends. Response from Maria July 2021 Thank you very much for your great feedback & the your lovely review. We hope to see you again here with us! Best regards from the staff of Kamarella estate.
13277040,Gesa Carolin September 2020 Absolutely great! We had an amazing time and a wonderful stay at Marias House. We definitely recommend the house with the big garden and the stunning view. And we´ll come back :) Response from Maria September 2020 Thank you very much for your kind words and we hope to see you really soon! Take care & stay safe. Best wishes from the staff of Kamarella Estate.
13277040,Alexander September 2020 Kamarella is just too good to be true! Not only the large and charming house  the beautiful location in the hills outside of Korfu town and the quiet surroundings are perfect. The welcome by Maria and her assistant was very warm  they showed us around and explained everything. They even prepared a welcome basket so we felt at home right from the start.  The property is amazing due to the natural water pool  the huge garden including fresh fruit and vegetables. If you want a home away from home to enjoy the beautiful surroundings and relax  pick Kamarella! :) Response from Maria September 2020 Thank you very much for your wonderful feedback & the great review. We hope to see you again here with us! Best regards from the staff of Kamarella estate.
13277040,Jim July 2020 We had a fantastic stay at this beautiful home. If you a looking for a peaceful stay  in a location near to Corfu town  but also a short drive from Pelekas  and nearby beaches  this is perfect. The house  gardens and pool are so special. Maria is a wonderful host. Response from Maria August 2020 Thank you very much for your wonderful feedback. We hope to see you again here with us! Stay safe!!! best regards the staff of Kamarella estate.
13277040,Emma June 2019 This place is too good to be true. Peaceful and elegant  spacious and full of flowers  with spectacular views.  Maria was so generous with food in the house to tide us over when we arrived - and she met us at 11.30pm at the airport.  I hope not too many people read this review because we want to go back again and again to Kamarella. Corfu is a lovely island too - really unspoilt and relaxed and beautiful. We had a heavenly holiday. Thank you so much  Maria!
13277040,Magnus June 2019 Simply stunning villa surrounded in a lush orchard with amazing views. Beautiful old style touches to the house giving it a proper Greek feel. The personal welcome at the airport plus a walk through the orchard to familiarise oneself with all the herbs available was fantastic and thoughtful. The welcome basket with local snacks and alcohol very welcome as was a fridge stocked with enough to last a few days. Furthermore towels and bedding is changed half way through your stay and the pool as always fresh and waiting. The gardens  flowers  brood of cats and the tranquillity of the villa made this one of the best week long holidays we've had in a while. Corfu town  the supermarkets  beach and airport are literally 15 mins away.
13277040,Julia April 2019 Marias home is even better than the images portray. The house is set in a stunning area  with wonderful walks nearby. Maria met us at the airport  she escorted us to the house where she greeted us with food and drinks to last us for a couple of days. From then on we had contact on a daily basis. She even showed us around Corfu town and showed us Tavenas for the locals  away from the tourist areas. I can't thank Maria enough for everything!
13277040,Els August 2018 Fantastic welcome by Maria (pick-up at airport  full fridge)  fantastic house (spacious  cosy) with fantastic garden (natural pool  cats) in fantastic area (central  calm). The perfect place for families who like to explore the island or hide away there in the hills when it’s too hot elsewhere.
13277040,Andrea July 2018 We - me and my family loved the place! It s all up in the hills of corfu and very green and luch! The whole place has s very good feeling! There is fresh water from the mountain running through the property! ! The pool is all fresh wAter and ice cold just out of the mountain! Nice vieuw  for us a real Retraite! Thank you maria!
13277040,Marie-Agnes June 2018 Maria is a wonderful horst. She picked us up at the airport  made sightseeing with us in Korfu town . We had a wonderful week  a perfect house for a family!
13277040,David September 2017 This is a lovely property. Very rural but with fabulous views across green countryside and with mountain views in the distance. Nicely furnished. Fabulous gardens and grounds and wonderful [cold] freshwater swimming pool. Plenty of places of interest locally. There is a taverna about 1.5km distance  but generally no bars or restaurants within usual walking distance but plenty within a 5 or 10 minute drive. A super area in central Corfu.
13277040,Marion August 2017 Maria picked us up from the airport. This was a very warm welcome. She showed us the way to Kamara. At arrival she bought all kinds of nice food  so no worries for the first day(s). A small shop in which you will find all necessary product is only 5 mins drive away. The shop owners are very friendly and you will get to know the local products.  The pool (which is 1m. deep) provides a great way to cool down after you spend some time  reading a book at the pool. It is great to wake up and jump in the pool for a refreshing morning dive. The kids would not get to bed if the could not take an after dinner dip.  While you stay  the garden will be kept after by the gardeners and the house is kept clean by a cleaning lady. No worries about fresh towels or bed linen.  The closest beach is at about 15 mins drive. We preferred some beaches at about 40 mins drive. The trip is worth driving.  Maria is a very lovely hostess. She keeps in touch and you can always ask her anything. We stayed at her house with 2 kids  they loved the stay  the pool  the garden and the cats. This was a lovely holiday. A good memory for ever.  Thank you Maria xx. Show more
13277040,Sean July 2017 We cannot recommend this property highly enough! Maria was a helpful  warm and generous hostess  who made us feel like family. She met us at the airport  thoroughly spoilt us with her welcome gifts of food and local specialities  and even gave our 11 year old a giant inflatable crocodile which became her inseparable companion in the spectacular  spring-fed pool. The house is stunning  set in beautiful grounds with spectacular views. It is spacious and comfortable  and it was difficult to prize the child out of the pool in order to make the short trip to the old town or one of the beautiful nearby beaches. Look no further and stay here. We will certainly be recommending Maria's house to friends and family. Response from Maria July 2017 Dear Mia and Sean   Thank you for your polite words  it was a real pleasure to host in my house! The house is missing you already! Greetings from the kittens and my kisses to Mia and the crocodile... :)  Maria Show more
13277040,Denis June 2017 We spent wonderful three weeks in Corfu staying at Maria's place. Kamarella has excellent location in the middle of the island if you want to explore Corfu (and of course have a car). Only 20 min drive to Kerkyra  15 min to the nearest beach Agios Gordios  15 min to get to amazing Achilleion or see sunset from Kaizer's throne near Pelekas.  There is plenty of space for 5-6 people in Kamarella  big terrace with amazing view from the hill towards green valley with cypress trees. Delicious tangerines and kumquats growing in old garden right by villa windows.  Maria is very cordial host trying to do her best for the guests. She was in contact all the time and solved any issues very fast. The house is fully equipped (may be only except dishwasher) and you can feel there like home.  The pool with natural water that comes from the hill spring is quite unique. Although you can find the water temperature too fresh)) in first half of June. It's not deep (maximum about 1m) but very safe for children.  We highly recommend Maria's place to stay in beautiful Corfu island! Show more
13277040,David April 2017 A fantastic place to stay. Beautiful and character filled house in peaceful location with incredible views. Maria was a wonderful and would definitely recommend this place to friends.
13277040,Kalliopi September 2016 We could not have enjoyed our stay in Corfu any more due to the stunning accommodation of Kamarella Estate and the warm generosity of Our host Maria. The fridge was full of local treats and the children gifted colour pencils and paper due to pending bad weather. We were two families (4 children) and were comfortably accommodated in the spacious house  terrace with sweeping views over pine forests  beautiful garden and natural pool. The children spent hours exploring the garden  picking fruit from the trees and swimming in the child friendly pool. Maria was only a text message away with any queries or recommendations on the best places to visit and dine on this beautiful island. We Had such a memorable time  the children were almost in tears when we left. we would not stay anywhere else on our return to Corfu in the future. Thank you Maria! Response from Maria September 2016 Thank you for your kind words! I am glad you had a great time! I am especially happy that the children enjoyed their stay at Kamarella Estate. The garden was an ideal place for them to explore the beauty of Corfiot nature. We are looking forward to seeing all of you again! Show more
13277040,Nathalie August 2016 We really loved our stay! The house  the garden and the pool are amazing. Everything in the house is charming and stylish. Maria is a lovely host. It is a peaceful spot and in the neighbourhood of the most beautiful sandy beaches. Response from Maria September 2016 Thank your for your kind words. You were lovely guests and I am looking forward to see you again. Greetings from the kittens!
13277040,Gerard October 2021 Very large house with garden and cold pool. We were picked up from the airport  a car is really necessary  the house is in the mountains and is quite remote. The kitchen and fridge are full of drinks and food. The guidance of Maria and Corina was great. We had a lovely time on the island. It was always nice to go back to the house  wonderfully quiet. Restaurants are further away  at the beach at Agios Gordinos are most  especially Linda's is fun and tasty  quite touristy. Go to the beach at Corfu beach no. 1 much more fun and quick  parking downstairs. Translated from Dutch  Show original
13277040,Cecile August 2021 Amazing stay in this house and flowery garden. You immediately feel good  everything is designed to be pleasant to live and enjoy the present moment.

13277040,Alexandra August 2016 Maria's family home is a very nice place. Located in the heart of the island  the tranquility and beauty of the landscape is a real pleasure. The property is full of fig tree  lemon orange and Kakiers and the lovely gardener let us enjoy this garden of Eden. Maria is welcoming and generous  the fridge is full for breakfast and snacks. A basket of fruit and a gift basket of corfiotes await you. The pool is just for you  it is filled with mountain water and it is refreshing. Kids will love that the garden is inhabited by cats and cats. The house is decorated with antique furniture  drawings and paintings that still add character to this beautiful place. Thank you Maria !

4171525,Sean September 2022 Overall  fantastic villa! We couldn’t rate it highly enough for our family holiday of 6 adults and 1 baby. Jeanne and Phillipe were very accommodating and helpful  if ever we had a question or required anything  such as arranging private transfers to and from the airport.  The villa is very spacious (bigger than it looks in the photos)  the bedrooms are all a great size with 3 out of 4 of them being en-suites. The kitchen is completely equipped and having the dishwasher for a large group really made life easy. Also having access to laundry facilities in the basement is great.  The pool area is so spacious  it is great for spending time together and the view is immaculate. From your pool you can watch the sea and in the distance Old Town Corfu (which lights up at night).  The town Dassia  has all you would need regarding supermarket  cafes  restaurants and bars etc. The closest supermarket (Joy) offers free delivery to the villa aswell which is helpful as the villa is a 5 minute walk up a slight hill. We managed it with a pram completely fine. There are many things to do in the area aswell from the surrounding towns which means you’ve got a complete holiday without having to travel far.  I do recommend taking the bus into Old Town Corfu which costs only €1.50. Ipsos the next town up from Dassia  hosts long beaches and tonnes of dining and nightlife places.  I would definitely return to Villa Jeanne if I am visiting Corfu again  you won’t be disappointed if you stay here! Thank you. Show more
4171525,Clair August 2022 Had an amazing stay here. The villa is absolutely stunning so relaxing and just perfect for 8 people. The villa is situated near restaurants and beach approx 10/15 minute walk. There is no need for a car but the walk to/from the villa is up quite a steep hill along a dark road but we felt very safe as there’s a few hotels along the way so there were other people walking up and down. It would be no problem for anyone to walk along here unless you are in very poor health. Jeannick and Philippe were amazing hosts. answered any question straight away and were so helpful with recommendations and arranging our transfers. We even had fresh honey given to us from the local bee-keeper which was delicious. We will definitely return  hopefully in the near future. We are so grateful to you Jeannick & Philippe for allowing us to rent out your stunning villa. Response from Jeanne Et Sandra August 2022 Hi Clair  the villa is at the top the hill. There's not electricity on most roads due to the savings in electricity. The cost here is incredible. Our village is very sure and quiet. It was a pleasure for us to help you for your holidays   and to meet you. Hope to see you again at home. Show more
4171525,Dominic August 2022 We travelled as a group of eight  five adults and three teenagers. This was our first experience of holidaying in a villa and it certainly won't be our last. The villa is clean  contemporary and equipped with everything you will need to make your stay an enjoyable one. The views surrounding the villa are stunning and the outdoor areas/gardens are spacious  obviously lots of thought has gone into the overall design/layout of the villa. But  for us  the most impressive part was the infinity pool and its spectacular sea view.  Jeannick and her husband were perfect hosts  they were welcoming and helpful and always on hand to offer advice and answer questions. Jeannick also recommended things for us to do during our stay on the island  one of which was a boat trip to Kassiopi  which we'd highly recommend. It was a good way of seeing other parts of Corfu.  Some of our group hired bicycles and explored some of the more remote villages. All agreed the scenery was breathtaking.  The villa's location is close to amenities and not far from the beach/restaurants but it's worth mentioning that it's a fairly steep access road and this might prove tricky if you have walking difficulties.  Dassia has some nice restaurants but Ipsos is worth a visit if you want a bit more nightlife/shopping and visiting Corfu town is an absolute must.  We would not hesitate at returning to Villa Jeanne again. We had a fantastic holiday. Show more
4171525,John July 2022 I thoroughly recommend staying at this amazing villa. It’s a beautiful modern house with everything you could possibly need to have a great holiday. Four double bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. One of which is actually a self contained studio with a kitchenette. A huge kitchen/ dining room which open onto the sun terrace & pool. The two bedrooms upstairs open on to a huge upper terrace . Without exaggeration between both terraces you’ve probably got room for 20 sun beds !. Also on the terrace there is seating for 10 people   great for meals at any time thanks to the electric canopy. The walk to the nearest supermarket ( e-joy) although not far is very steep on the way back   but you soon get used to it. The beach is a further 200 mts with many bars & restaurants on the seafront. Dassia is great whether you decide to hire a car or not. As it is pretty centrally located most resorts/attractions are within a short driving distance. Dassia is on the main bus route & they run frequently ( every 20 minutes) . A single ticket to Corfu Town is 1.50 euros & can be purchased at the e-joy supermarket. Jeannick is a fantastic host who’s always available for advice but is never intrusive . Despite the amazing house & pool area my favourite part of the holiday was the view . I never tired of looking over sea to Corfu town & the Old Fort   stunning regardless of the time of day . We traveled as seven adults   a three year old & a baby . However any combination of travellers couldn’t fail to have a great time in this wonderful place. Show more
4171525,Theresa May 2022 The location of the villa is perfect for the beach shops and restaurants . The hosts were lovely and made us feel so welcome and could not do enough for us. The villa has everything you need and is clean and luxurious and we had a fab trip Response from Jeanne Et Sandra May 2022 Hi Theresa . Thank you for your suggestion. It's a good idea. If you want to come back again   don't hesitate to contact me. jtranchant@gmail.com
4171525,Sarah August 2021 This is a great  well-equipped  smart house with a lovely pool  view  patio area... private and yet walking distance to the beach and to the local shops and supermarket  in a well connected village with a regular bus to Corfu Town. The beach swimming was superb. We went down every morning and then had breakfast at the bakery that the host recommends. What a perfect start to the day. Jeannick is the most wonderful host. She and her husband really care that you have a good time and enjoy their house. They communicate quickly and helpfully and it's all set up to get you enjoying your stay pretty much as soon as you arrive. Many many thanks.
4171525,Alison August 2020 We enjoyed a fantastic stay at this Villa  it’s in a great location near to lovely restaurants and the sea  plus the pool is fantastic. Jeannick is an amazing host  arranging taxi transfers  car hire and providing lots of recommendations on where to visit in Corfu and lovely restaurants. Do note that one of the rooms is a self contained studio that is adjoining the villa but does have a separate entrance. This will work brilliantly for some parties  but should be considered.
4171525,Marcus August 2019 Had very nice holidays with some friends. Awesome villa with beautiful pool and view. Would love to come back again!
4171525,Sarah July 2019 The villa is amazing. It is a great spot to spend time with family and friends. If you want to explore and stay in Dassia  this is a great location. The view is breathtaking. The hosts provided helpful tips and were super responsive. The pictures are a true reflection of the villa.
4171525,David July 2019 As two families looking for the perfect combination of luxury and location this beautiful house has it all. Quiet and convenient- the views are stunning and the house very well designed. Thanks to Jeannick and Philippe - been a pleasure 😎
4171525,Veronica June 2019 We stayed at the Villa and was well located within easy walks to markets  bakeries and also car rental’s (Helga is super helpful). The house is very comfortable with rooms on both levels also in addition to the swimming pool and views the house has a lot of green areas. Also Dassia beach is 20 minutes from a lot of locations
4171525,Thomas September 2018 Dear Jeannick! The villa was simply beautiful! From the pool you can see the sea and the landscape! Every room has its own bathroom and toilet which was very comfortable when living with eight girls. You can reach the beach  restaurants and the supermarket easily from the villa and the neighbours and people we met there were all very nice and helped us if we had questions. We had everything and more than we needed in the villa like a dishwasher  air-conditioner in every room  a washing machine  a barbecue and also a very friendly pool boy! Thanks for this great chance for us to completely relax in your villa!
4171525,Eleni August 2018 Spectacular home with amazing views of Corfu! The home was very well thought for accommodating guests  we very much enjoyed our stay.
4171525,Rebecca August 2018 A really fabulous villa  quiet location but a short walk from the beach and shops. The supermarket delivers free of charge so we didn’t need a car. The pool is great  the house well equipped and sparkling clean. Jeannick is a great host. Thoroughly recommended.
4171525,Heather August 2018 Jeannick’s house was a perfect spot to explore Corfu from. It is just as pictured  but better. The pool is a dream. And the communication and tips on local amenities was so helpful. I can’t recommend this house more.
4171525,Artem July 2018 the second year we have a rest in this house! we are very satisfied!
4171525,Maya July 2018 The villa was perfectly situated in Dassia and gives the visitor a great chance to see everyday life in a typical Corfiot village and is also situated near all the major tourist attractions. It is also quite close to the beach and has a lovely infinity pool from which one can see ships in the Ionian sea. Jeannick was a very responsive host  however  due to the language barrier on both sides there were some misunderstandings that led to a few uncomfortable moments. I would advise visitors to clarify details with the host on the phone and then confirm by message. But overall  we had a delightful time in Corfu- the island was perfect in every way- and at Jeannick’s villa. Response from Jeanne Et Sandra July 2018 Maya  i very surprise about your advice to clarify the details. Read other reviews  I never had complaints before.
4171525,Joanne June 2018 The accommodation is stylish  clean and spacious and Jeannick is very helpful with practical information about transfers and local amenities and suggestions for activities.
4171525,David June 2018 Great place  wonderful  responsive and caring host  location perfect  excellent pool  quality staff close to local amenities but still very private. would recommend to all.
4171525,Roxanne September 2017 The house is really really nice with large bedrooms  modern bathrooms and separate toilets. We were with 8 ladies and had a great time! The seaview is fabulous just like the infinity pool. Plenty of room for your luggage and luxury bathing towels. The kitchen is very well equipped. The beach is on walking distance just like the supermarket  restaurants and bars. The owner wants you to enjoy as much as possible. She helped us with all kind of questions and special requests( very quick response time) and gave us the feeling that we were good friends in stead of guests. Unfortunately you have to go home one day...
4171525,Susan August 2017 Great place  great view.
4171525,Gemma August 2017 The views from the infinity pool are superb ! Wonderful to have a morning swim watching the boats & coastline with wooded hills all across & behind within easy walking distance to the sea & shops. The house is to a very high specification with every detail considered - excellent space for 8 & great for teenagers wanting space & independence to wander off to the local beach club  bars & cafes. Very highly recommended!
4171525,Daniel July 2017 This villa was absolutely perfect in every way for my extended family as we celebrated a 60th birthday. Extremely modern  clean  every possible amenity you can think of and as well as a very well thought out layout/floorplan. Pool and terrace area was fantastic for keeping the children entertained too. Jeannick was always very prompt with her responses and was always on hand to answer any questions. Thoroughly recommend this villa for any large groups staying in Dassia. We will book again if in Dassia! Thank you!
4171525,Karen July 2017 6 adults  3 small children aged 5  3 & 1 and the house was perfect. Swimming pool has large shallow end so children had a fabulous time. 10 minutes to walk to beach  shops and an amazing selection of tavernas. We didn't hire a car and went into Corfu on the very good bus service. Beach not picture postcard. The host was always very helpful and replied to email very quickly. Highly recommend Response from Jeanne Et Sandra July 2017 The Dassia beach is the first beach after Corfou Town. A bus stop is only 300 meters away. To have a nice view you have to go to the end of the beach in front of the old Club med. The beach is perfect for children no depth on several meters. Show more
4171525,Peter June 2017 This villa is perfect in quiet area with great views but walking distance of local restaurants. Local beach ok but pebbles like most in corfu Plenty of space for 8 adults with sun on the patio from early morning to evening . We would recommend a car to fully enjoy Corfu and the good resturants in village of Kato Korakiana peter
4171525,Phillippa August 2016 The villa was beautiful  secluded and peaceful and Jeannick was a very thoughtful and responsive host.  The villa is really well appointed with all the kitchen equipment you could possibly need and all the rooms are really clean  with ensuite bathrooms and separate ensuite WCs.  It was great having the pool on the same level as the kitchen and dining areas with such a big terrace so we could relax as parents  keeping an eye on the kids splashing about whilst doing other things.  Jeannick gave us lots of great local recommendations including Al's in ypsos for wonderful fresh seafood in relaxed taverna on the beach but away from the road  and evening drinks / food at dusk at under olive groves at Dassia Beach hotel.
4171525,Tamra July 2016 The house is beautiful and the location is great. Every room has a great view and great amenities. The grounds and pool are very well maintained and wonderful. Jeanne is a great host  very easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again.
4171525,Steven May 2016 Jeanne and Phillip have a lovely apartment  more than comfortable for 8 people. The views from the villa are excellent  and the pool is really inviting. They were kind enough to leave us loads of bottled water  along with 3 boxes of wine.  Dassia is just a 5 minute walk away (maybe a bit longer up the hill on the way back!) and it has some really nice restaurants and bars and the beach is only a few minutes further.  The decking out front is very spacious  and the barbecue is great and easy to use.  I would definitely recommend  very modern and clean and everyone in my party had a great time.
4171525,Zion August 2015 Very pleasant house  well equipped and maintained. Everything was perfect. Good location  very close to a beautiful beach.
4171525,Tina August 2015 The host was easy to contact if needed   the people we dealt with on behalf of the host were very friendly and helpful . Beautiful area and fabulous house especially the outside pool area with its beautiful views .

29975535,Giacomo July 2022 Spectacular house  very large  we were in 11 guys comfortably  and equipped with every comfort  from air conditioning in each room  to the kitchen equipped with every utensil. Upon our arrival in the kitchen  basic cooking condiments were already prepared (oil  salt  pepper) and in each bathroom  hand soap  shapo and shower bath; as well as dishwasher tablets  surface soaps and washing machine detergents. The house is equipped with bath linens and bedding in numerous amounts. Tranquility is its strength  if you are looking for a comfortable situation and a sea view  Villa Victoria is the place to do it. The only downside is the location. 10/12 min from downtown Corfu and the airport. To get to the house  from the main street  you have to go a little uncomfortable. Translated from Italian  Show original
29975535,Διονύσης July 2021 The house was amazing! The total silence? The cool from the lush garden? It had comfortable spaces for all of us (9 people)  the best was the 4 bathrooms  which we used at the same time without taking water from each other. It's a big deal when you're a multitude of families with young children! The house wasn't really missing anything. It even had ice cubes in the freezer! Excellent hospitality by Ms. Letta  friendly  helpful and discreet! Translated from Greek  Show original
13589839,Paweł June 2022 The house is very nice and clear. Pool is big and not so deep. So for our family was very good. Beach is close that house. About 5-7min walk. From house you see sea and hear it. I recommend it for anyone who prefer quiet and beautiful area.
13589839,Ausra April 2022 Our group (2 families) had a great time at Villa Aris. There was plenty of everything  beutiful environment  amazing views to the sea and the mountains. We absolutely loved our stay :) It is very calm place  perfect if you are looking for escape from city life
13589839,Marco August 2021 Beautiful Apartment at the quiet side of the island. We had an amazing vacation here  the villa is large enough for holding 9 people. The beach is just a 5 minute walk away  but there are also two other even better beaches in walking distance (15 Min). The pool was cleaned everyday  and even a small damage that we caused was fixed within a day. After half our stay the villa was cleaned  which we didn’t expect  all staff is very kind an can even speak a little german. We highly recommend staying at Villa Aris.  The only thing to know is that you need to have a rental car because the next supermarket is at least 5 km away. Thanks for hosting us  we‘ll come back!
13589839,Iris August 2021 A great choice if your looking to stay in a more quiet part of the island. Very well kept  great pool and facilities. The communications was amazing  really - every need was tended to. Nice beach just a few mintues walk away  and a beautiful view.
13589839,Ammad August 2020 Villa Aris is incredible.  The pool and pool area suited the 5 of us perfectly. Plenty of space and sun loungers. Pool was cleaned every morning by Spiros' father so was available from 10am everyday. We spent most of the daylight hours here.  As it got later and slightly cooler  still above 20 for our august evenings  we moved to the seating and barbeque area at the back of the villa with a great view and the wonderful sound of the sea.  Paramonas beach is a short walk away with a couple of nice options for a morning coffee  tasty lunch or evening drinks.  You will need a car to get to the villa. Its a winding  hilly route best first attempted in the daylight  although we made the drive in the dark in around 40 minutes from the airport. On this side of the island a car is pretty essential if you plan to leave the villa. Parking is provided. When you arrive dont go down the drive to villa aris as it is a nightmare to reverse out of (thanks for the help spiros!) The parking spot is a few metres along the road on your right once you see the villa aris driveway.  Villa was equipped with bbq equipment  cocktail shakers  2 outdoor showers  ice cube trays. Everything we needed.  Thank you Spiros for a great stay! Show more
13589839,Alessandro July 2020 Amazing villa. Everything perfect.
13589839,Anne August 2019 We had a wonderful vacation in Villa Aris  Paramonas is far from the crowded places in Corfu  perfect for people looking for quiet holidays. Mr Spiros has been an extraordinary host  always helpful & full of delicate attentions. The house was very clean and comfortable  with a beautiful swimming pool and an amazing view on the sea. We recommend the tavern in Paramonas beach  they play traditional greek music on Thursdays at 9.00pm. The food was great and we had a lot of fun !
13589839,Sara August 2019 This is a fab location near idyllic beaches and quaint villages in a quiet area of Corfu. The pool and apartments are not overlooked  in a private area  clean and well equipped. It is worth noting that this is two apartments  especially if you are travelling with young children. We didn’t realise that until we arrived but two of our children were just old enough to sleep in an apartment on their own so it didn’t matter. Spiros was a great host and this is a great place to explore Corfu from. Highly recommend.
13589839,Stephanie July 2019 A lovely location for a family holiday in a quieter area. The villa is ideal for a large family and the pool is lovely. Spiros was very helpful with anything that we needed.
13589839,Mia July 2019 It is a lovely villa with lovely hosts always there to help if you need anything. It was very nice and clean with an excellent pool area.
13589839,Mindaugas July 2019 Fanatstic pool  views  host and the beach nearby !
13589839,Tom June 2019 Spiros was so helpful and really communicative before we attended the Villa. Breathtaking views  and such a calm and relaxing atmosphere. It's hidden away from tourists and the general bustle  which made this spot a perfect place to relax. We where kindly greeted with some red wine  and our towels / sheets / toiletries where often replenished. The space worked really well between the 7 of us. The pool was beautiful and there was a good ratio of shade to light spots throughout the space! Would love to go back - it was a very easy rental.
13589839,Robert September 2018 Super clean  fantastic views  great pool  cannot fault anything.
13589839,Giovanni June 2018 Me and my family (se were in 5) found our staying at Villa Aris Amazing! Firstly  Spiros and his family are really kind and helpful for every situation; Furthermore  Villa Aris is extremely comfortable: private parking  a beaututiful swimming pool (which is daily cleaned by Spiros)  beautiful bedrooms with terraces  a wonderful garden with a fantastic view on the coastline; check in is flexible. Villa Aris is also near to a village  wich includes supermarkets  restaurants and pubs.  Concluding  our esperience in Villa Aris was great.
13589839,Zinica April 2018 We had a great time staying at Villa Aris! Mr. Spiros is a wonderful host. He was there when we arrived and showed us around. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a bottle of their specialty liquor. The villa is beautiful  spacious  very clean and has everything you need. A car is necessary  since there is not much to do walking distance. I would recommend this villa.
13589839,Alexandre September 2017 We enjoyed our stay. Pool was fantastic and check in very smooth and easy.
13589839,Raphaël August 2017 The villa is really well located  and owners keeps the place really cleaned. It was a pleasure to share with them  they know how to make you feel as your own place. They were also really helpful on every step of our trip and show us best tips in the Island. More than a classic rent it was truthful meeting with a really nice family who shared same value as us: strong family bond ! A car is a must have  and I strongly recommand it to anyone. The house is divided on twi appartments. Enjoy it !!
13589839,Rita August 2017 Spiros' place was great! The beach is only a 5-7 minute walk  and is absolutely stunning and quiet ! The view from the house is just like the photos   you can watch the sunset from the balcony  so beautiful ! The house had everything we needed and the kitchen was well equipped! The pool was truly amazing and they had fresh clean towels for us. Spiros came to clean the pool every morning!! We loved staying there and would definetly stay there again. My family was very happy here and we had a fantastic holiday! Thank you again!
13589839,Hebe July 2017 We (two families  4 adults and 5 children) had the most amazing time at Villa Aris. We arrived at night (after an exciting drive through the mountains from the airport) and had a warm welcome from the owner Mr. Spiros and his daughter who were so helpfull and attentive planning our stay beforehand. The beautifully lit pool made our welcome complete. The next morning we were in awe by the beautiful view on the ocean and the overall surroundings. What a heavenly tranquil place to wake up in. We spent ten perfect days all together snorkelling  swimming  enjoying great fresh food  sunshine  friendly people and the great  well equipped Villa. It has everything you need to enjoy the good life on Corfu. Definitely a place to return to in the near future.

13589839,Gianmaria August 2020 We had a serene and relaxing vacation. The house is located in a quiet location with a very evocative sea view. The cleanliness is great. The amenities are adequate.

37681888,Safia September 2022 Alexandra’s place is beautiful and in a great location  great transport links with a bus stop right outside and easy access to the longer bus routes to other parts of the island. We had an amazing stay and would really recommend if you want to visit Corfu as the place and the island are lovely!
37681888,Jemma September 2022 Me and my boyfriend came to stay at Alexandra’s place for a week. Her parents were very welcoming and gave us all the information we needed for a great stay in Corfu. The house was very clean and In a perfect  safe location with a bus stop right outside which is only 10 mins to old town. You can also walk 10 minutes to the bridge which takes you over to a small island called Kanoni where we hired a boat for the day - highly recommend. Alexandra was so helpful sending us all the information we needed and answering any questions. Our neighbours were so friendly  one even making us fresh crab spaghetti! All in all it was a perfect holiday and not one bad word to say! Would 100% recommend.
37681888,Lucy September 2022 We had a fabulous time staying here - the location is great for getting to old town and also exploring the island. We would recommend parking at the hotel next door if you have a car  rather than on the street  as we managed to get ourselves a parking ticket for parking in the wrong place! our hosts kindly offered to sort this out for us  however. There is also a useful mobile app that tells you real time bus departures so you aren't waiting at the stop for too long! The apartment is well stocked and comfortable  would certainly recommend.
37681888,Mareike August 2022 we felt very comfortable during the week in Corfu. The accommodation was clean and very well maintained. Our highlight was the proximity to the water. Communication with Alexandra was very good as she was particularly helpful and friendly. We would love to come back.
37681888,Anna August 2022 We spent two weeks here and had a wonderful time. The house is cozy  clean and had everything we needed - but what makes this place really special is the outdoor area. The view is amazing and the sea is right there  just a few steps away. A feature that we got really used to and are already missing is the garden shower  which was perfect for a quick cool-down. Alexandra and her parents were helpful and sweet and made us feel very welcome. Thank you!
37681888,Marie June 2022 Absolutely perfect!!
37681888,Charlie June 2022 Such a great place  very spacious inside and a lovely area out the front the pictures don’t tell a lie. The only thing was it is on a flight path into the airport but this wasn’t anything to put us off! Hope to come back here
37681888,Jānis May 2022 The house met all our expectations. It was clean and tidy  equiped with all one can need for comfortable staying. Location is perfect (1 minute walk to the sea) and there is wonderful restaurant next door. Hostess Alexandra is real finding. She help us whenever we needed and gave perfect tips for exploring the island so our stay became more pleasant.
37681888,Kayla April 2022 Amazing. Literature lovers-- Odysseus' ship turned to stone is right there. No sighting of Poseidon.
37681888,Chantal October 2021 Alexandra is very fast in helping you out for tips and tricks for you’re lovely stay at the apartment. With extra info about Corfu makes the vacation compleet. Also her parents help you out in everyway if needed.
37681888,Chris And Sue October 2021 Alexandra is helpful  polite and very efficient at providing information about local area etc. She and her parents were flexible with checking out and a great help with buses.
37681888,Nicol October 2021 Alexandra house is so cozy  clean and perfect  with a wonderful view. If you like to walk is good to do it to the city center  otherwise you can take a bus. The communication was super  Alexandra helped us a lot with information before and during our stay. There was so many details at the house that I could say is one of my favorites Airbnb experience  thank you Alexandra and mom ☺️ Definitely I recommend this house 🙌 (Airplanes pass close to the house but in some specific hours of the day  and only for arrivals).
37681888,Luca September 2021 We spent 8 great days in the property. The hosts are wonderful and help you have a amazing vacation.
37681888,Luan September 2021 Excellent option! Specially for those looking for a great view. Alexandra is a wonderful host  welcomed us very well and assisted in literally everything we needed. The house is very well equipped and comfortable  and although a bit tight inside for four people  the garden at the front and back makes up for the space! Beach in the front is very quiet and nice  but is also visited and sometimes watched by neighbors  some of them conservative (for instance  nudism is not accepted). Airport runway is very close  that might be inconvenient for sensitive people. In general  a very good quality-price ratio. We were very satisfied!
37681888,Anna August 2021 Very good and helpful communication with Alexandra. Clean and well equipped house (for example she provided us with coffee  sweets and other nice food). Awesome views. Planes are indeed close but the noise vamishes quickly. The sofa beds are really big amd comfortable. Would book again! Thanks for everything.
37681888,Lucile August 2021 Alexandra is a very nice host  very helpful ! The flat is quite well located (unless you are in Corfu for partying in the old town) and charming. Bonus : the air conditioner in the bedroom !
37681888,Sawyer July 2021 They go above and beyond to make you feel very welcomed. They help with any questions you may have about the city or about things you might want to do. The view is beautiful from the back yard. I Would recommend anyone to stay here. It is very close to the bus stop and delicious restaurants. It is very close to the airport too so you can hear planes landing. It didn’t bother my wife and I but it can get loud at times.
37681888,Petra July 2021 Excellent care of the family  this place is very lovely  we rested there a lot and completely enjoyed the stay. I wd like to recommend two restaurants  one is George´s located over the bridge on the hill accross the bus stop (excellent owner and a great cook)  the other is pancakes and wafers place 10-15 min walk away   keep walking on the left of the house gate - excellent food!:-)
37681888,Melis July 2021 Alexandra's house was wonderful for us and also communication with her was very smooth. We met at the house  then they gave us some introductions about house and tips for Corfu. It was really kind to had a gift pack with local products also. House location is perfect that was closed to city center by car and really calm area. Yes  it is close to the airport but the planes are not problem for us and sometimes we are enjoyed to watched them anyway:) Garden has beautiful view and you can find sunbeds  sofas  chairs and table that was really comfortable. We were in Corfu second time but Alexandra's house made our holiday better in this time!We are highly recommended this place! Thank you very much Alexandra and your family.
37681888,Kristina July 2021 Very nice place to stay. Very clean and comfortable house. Private beach access. Friendly neighbor. Impressive view and sound of landing planes :) everything is very great  only there was not always space for parking on the street  but that's no problem. The owners are very nice! Thanks for everything!
37681888,Mariëlle June 2021 A fantastic place to stay! We went here on our honeymoon  loved the house and the surroundings. Everything was clean en obviously cared for. We had a great stay and would surely reccommend it to everyone! Also  Alexandra and her family are very sweet  and willing to help out with everything you need!
37681888,Kevin October 2020 Always good when the billing lives up to expectations   even better when it exceeds as this one did. Great little property   steps from the sea with charming views over to Mouse Island and Greek mainland beyond. What always sets good hosts apart from so so hosts is the level of thought and care they give . The hosts of this listing are 5star +. By prior arrangement we arrived well after midnight and they were there to greet us and show us around the property . Nice touches such as basic foods and welcome gift pack we much appreciated. The first morning brought great wake up view and a walk down a few steps to pre breakfast swim in the vey calm and clear sea.Dipped our toes most days even managing to swim the couple hundred mtrs or so Mouse Island. Covered terrace with two lounging sofas + dining table /chairs + loungers on the lawned area helped ensure an alfresco stay making the most of the late season weather. Bus stop either side of the road within 10 mtr of the property made easy journeys into Corfu Town or further down the coast . Alexandra responded very quickly to any messages / queries pre arrival ( of which there we a few from us due to Covid situation ) and during stay with info on area etc . Overall 5* stay with 5*+ hosts Show more
37681888,Emiliano August 2020 Probably no apartment is ever perfect but some of them are so great that let you disregard the very little issues they have. Vista del Mar is such an apartment. A few issues: as you already know  it is near  VERY near the airport and be sure you will hear all of the incoming flights. But that's also a fantastic opportunity for a lot  a LOT of great creative pictures you can take from the garden. With a very very few exceptions  all the flights are during the day and won't wake you up. There are mosquitoes but Alexandra leaves you with a full range of weapons against it and I found one of the sprays particularly effective to prevent bites (and I am a favourite target of mosquitoes..) When I was there there were a couple of cats (among the several cats inhabiting the whole island) that felt particularly at home in the garden. This can be a gigantic plus if you have cat-lover kids or spouse or it can be a nuisance if you don't particularly like felines (I am allergic to them). So you decide! There is a rather near Market  not particularly big but acceptable and the farthest one with more stuff. That's great. Unfoertunately the road to reach them is treacherous if you go walking. No problem if you have a car. That's it! the rest is great  really! First and foremost  the view... ahhh the view from the garden is amazing. Just get up at about 7 and enjoy a great sunrise each and every day. The garden is small  well kept  with nice long chairs and after around noon it starts being in the shade and it is amazing for relaxing. In less than a minute you walk to a basically private beach. it's not the best beach in the world but it shares the same view  it is safe and the water itself is crystal clear. You can easily swim to the island of Pontikonissi without paying for the ferry. You can catch crabs  snorkel for fishes. There are a few restaurants nearby  one is literally less than 30 steps from your door and it also sports a replica of Tommy Lee Jones posing as a waiter. Our personal recommendation is Alkinos though: 10 minutes walk but prices are lower and the lady serving you is exquisite.  Back to Vista del Mar: there are beds for 4 people  a double for adults and two couches. We managed to have our tallest kid (180+ cm) sleeping comfortably in one of them with no problems. There is also something to play but we never used it. The kitchen is small and I wouldn't use it if I had to cook all days but it was furnished with almost everything we needed for simple cooking. Dishwasher and Washing machines are working ok. Inside the house  Wifi is doing perfectly. In the garden  of course  the signal is weaker but still usable if you don't go too far. Around the house  there are other tools and things we didn't even had the time to explore.  To reach Corfu without a car you have two possible paths: the longest one with Bus #6 (Corfu - Benitses) or passing the bridge (in itself already a must do experience!) and take the Bus #2a (Corfu - Kanoni)... you can also walk from Kanoni to Corfu in less than an hour  the path is often in the shade too and not too risky.  Finally  Alexandra was really perfect  an exquisite host that immediately answered all of my anxious questions for the months prior to the trip and during our stay. She also left several products on the table and the fridge to welcome us and she let us stay longer the last day since we had a late ferry back.  Vista del Mar is not the cheapest place you will find around but I totally recommend it for a family with 1 or 2 young kids. Show more
37681888,Sanne July 2020 Amazing house! Great garden & view  beach on 1 minute walk  very clean and nice decorated house  easy communication with Alexandra who is very sweet. It’s absolutey recommended! Response from Alexandra August 2020 Thank you very much Sanne! It was great meeting you both !! Hope to see you again :)
37681888,"Ton September 2019 Alxandra's house was everything we hoped for. A beautiful house with a well equipped kitchen  a good shower and a nicely decorated living. However we lived most of the time outside. The house has a wonderful terrace and a garden that look out over the sea and ""Mouse Island"". Such a great view  we sat there for hours watching the cruise ships  ferries and sailing boats go by. If you like plane spotting this location has an extra  incoming planes to Kerkyra Airport fly by at no more than 100 meters from your terrace. Quite an amazing experience.  Alexandra is a very hospitable and communicative host. She helped us very well with questions we had before and during our stay and a quick reply was always guaranteed. Nice detail is the box filled with local products that we found at our arrival. Thanks so much Alexandra for everything. We can highly recommend your house to others! Response from Alexandra October 2019 Thank you very much Ton for your kind words!! It was a pleasure hosting you  hope to host you again in the future!"
37681888,Georgina September 2019 What a lovely place! Stayed for a few nights and had an excellent time  the garden is an amazing area with seating and sun lounges and right near to a lovely area to swim that's not busy. Lovely restaurants near by and an amazing crepe place a 1km walk up the road! Would stay again  a very lovely experience! 😊 Response from Alexandra September 2019 Τhank you very much Georgina! It was a pleasure to host all of you! Hope to see you again :)
37681888,Roberta September 2019 Very nice House in front of The sea very well furnished full of nice details . The only bad thing is The noise of The flight ( The airport is very very closed) . Alexandra is very kind and a perfect Host Response from Alexandra September 2019 Thank you very much Roberta! See you soon :)
37681888,ArieJan October 2022 We had a lovely time at Alexandra's cottage. Alexandra (or her parents) is very helpful and easy to reach  and issues were solved as soon as possible  and we got a handy list of restaurants and places of interest.  The cottage is centrally located on the island and is therefore an easy base to discover the whole island  also Kerkyra is nearby. Parking was allowed at the nearby hotel. The cottage is complete  and equipped with everything you need  and ideal for 2 people. The sea is close by for swimming (although you do have to swim a bit for what gets deeper).  We enjoyed the breakfast most in the sun on the terrace with the most beautiful view of the whole island. We were a little later in the season so there weren't that many planes left  they fly close  but at night they did not fly. Translated from Dutch  Show original
37681888,Stefania August 2022 Very lovely  yes  the planes do  but they haven't bothered me much. And also delicious neighbors. Alexandra top super Translated from Italian  Show original
37681888,"Rapahel August 2022 The house is very cute. The view is great and the small ""private beach"" is pleasant. The communication went great. You could write to her at any time and received a quick response. We enjoyed the week. Translated from German  Show original"
37681888,Sarah July 2022 We had a very nice time in Corfu. The beach is just a few meters away and communication with Alexandra was also very good. Translated from German  Show original
37681888,Marja July 2022 Lovely cottage with an amazing view. A wonderful sea for swimming and nice neighbors. Restaurants within walking distance where you can eat and in Corfu city you are in no time. Disruptions are the many planes flying over during the high season. But it's also fun and impressive and the cottage makes up for a lot! There is almost no flight at night. And out of high season it will be a lot less. Corfu is fun and very green but touristy. From this location you can drive everywhere. Recommended! Translated from Dutch  Show original
37681888,Laurent November 2021 The tiny house enjoys an exceptional view of Corfu's postcard site. I was even able to reach the island opposite the swim. The proximity to the airport is not inconvenient after all (there were few flights during our stay) and even an attraction when planes land (you never see so close!). The location has the advantage of being about fifteen minutes from the city center by car (there is also a bus) we were greeted by Alexandra's dad who was lovely. and alexandra was very available and responsive from afar. The only defect is probably the cleanliness of the beach (many garbage  not including seaweed). A storm a few days before our arrival seems one of the explanations  but it remains frustrating to be in such a magical place and not be able to fully enjoy it. Translated from French  Show original
37681888,Wilhelm September 2021 Beautiful house in a great location on the water. Own little beach at your doorstep. Super nice hostess. Has inquired about the well-being several times. Very happy to come back. Translated from German  Show original
37681888,Thomas August 2021 Alexandra's place is perfect ! Close to the airport and the city center 15 min from Corfu for 20th by taxi. It's easy to park by scooter or motorcycle thanks to the street parking. The accommodation is very clean. Lots of thoughtful touches from Alexandra and her parents. The views are breathtaking ! The outdoor space is perfect for lunch facing the sea with a very nice terrace with lawn  a small beach 20 seconds' walk 😁 Airplanes can be disruptive to sensitive people. But quickly forget and atypical for the place. The island opposite and can be visited in a few swims. Functional👍 room with air conditioning  equipped kitchen  pleasant living area  very clean and pretty bathroom. I would recommend Alexandra's place! Thanks again for hosting us and for your advice ! Translated from French  Show original
37681888,Carsten August 2021 Very nice hosts  great communication  place very clean  beautiful view. Direct beach not so nice  parking on the street can only be found with very good luck. But all in all great! Translated from German  Show original
37681888,Daniel & Marina September 2020 This had been the best experience with the apartment in my life. It's not just about great equipment or an enchanting view  but also small things that were deeply thought out and carefully prepared for guests. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and could hardly do any shopping. We actually had everything in the fridge and in other cupboards to spend the weekend without running out at home on the almost private beach. The food had not been the rest of previous guests  but was only carefully bought for us. There was everything you could think of  from fresh toothpaste and playing cards to mosquitoes and business card from a taxi company. At the key handover  we also received schedule of the buses and various maps of the island and many great recommendations. The buses that leave from the adjacent bus stop in different directions. The house is designed with many stylish items from the flea market and newly renovated. We had a lovely feeling all the time that there was also a family that supported us. The place is just great and highly recommended for everyone. Translated from German  Show original
37681888,Marta August 2020 We had a great time in Corfu and in this house! Beautiful location  Alexandra is very kind  attentive and helpful! If you are not bothered by the noise of the planes  seeing them land in front of the house between the island of Pontikonissi and the monastery of Vlacherna (unique places in Corfu)  it will be a scenic spectacle! I hope you have a great vacation! Translated from Italian  Show original
37681888,Mathieu August 2019 Very nice apartment  exceptional welcome and availability of Alexandra  all you'll need is air conditioning in the room so everything is perfect!

37681888,Francesco August 2019 We stayed in Alexandra's apartment from August 15-22  2019  my wife and the two little girls  8 and 4 years old. The house is very nice  well-kept and clean  with everything you need (new and quality sheets and towels). The small but comfortable living room has two double sofa beds  the large double bedroom  the kitchenette equipped with all the comforts and the functional bathroom and a nice shower. The highlight is the garden with breathtaking sea views  wonderful breakfast  relaxing and romantic in the evening  provided with perfection  umbrella and deck chair. Direct access to the sea. The house is located on the road between Corfu town and Benites  10 minutes by car from both and close to the airport (take off and landings can be heard!). Alexandra is a precise and reliable host  always available  she even greeted us with a small welcome gift. Highly recommended!!

548941697828257946,Pascal September 2022 Hi Maria   Thank you very much for our stay at your house. We had a great time  and everything was perfect. The pool and the kitchen right next to it were amazing. We spend our vacation at the pool and the amazing outdoor area.  Thank you  very much and best regards  Pascal Response from Maria September 2022 Thank you so much for your 5 stars feedback! Maria
548941697828257946,Hellie July 2022 Excellent value for money. Inside house is not fancy but does the job. Air con is a positive! Outside area and pool are fantastic and we spent all our time there. Lovely local restaurants are 2 minutes away. Elena who helps clean was very friendly. Would recommend! Response from Maria August 2022 Thank you for your lovely review! Maria
548941697828257946,Lavinia July 2022 We spent 3 weeks at Villa Aliki and loved it. The main benefit from the house is its outside kitchen and the pool area. We spent all our time there  using the house only to sleep. The house is 5 minutes walk from 2 wonderful tavernas  a greengrocer  a bakery and a supermarket. Aphrodite  the owner of the supermarket can order fish and meat on demand which we hadn't realised immediately. There is a small beach 10 minutes away and if you want one with restaurants and bars  just walk another 10 minutes to the right of it We rented a boat from Fontas and explored the coastline several times. The green buses are a very convenient way to explore the island  although in high season  these are sometimes full and won't stop to let you on. We had few niggles with the house when we arrived but Maria was very quick at sending someone to fix them. Communication with Maria was really easy and quick. The plumbing can be problematic in Corfou and no toilet paper/sanitary towel can be put in the toilets as it creates severe blockages. When we arrived  we could see that the outside toilet/shower on the men side was becoming a problem. I guess as it must be a bigger job to tackle  it was not solved during our stay. We would love to stay again. Show more Response from Maria July 2022 Thank you so much for your beautiful 5 stars review  Lavinia! You and your family have been great guests! Maria
548941697828257946,Elizabeth June 2022 The 8 of us had a fantastic time at villa Aliki! Perfect location with great tavernas next door and a good little supermarket as well. The outdoor kitchen was amazing and meant that we barely went inside at all. Would highly recommend and would definitely go and stay again!

We hope to see you soon again! Maria
548941697828257946,Shannon June 2022 What a wonderful stay we had at Villa Aliki. It has everything you would need for a long stay with family or friends for those that prefer their own space and an alternative to a hotel. The location is fantastic with 3 fantastic tavernas right outside your door. The pool is perfect and the outside communal kitchen was our favorite space in the villa for family bbq’s and evening drinks. You do however need a car or a scooter to access Nisaki beach and Mitsos Taverna. There is a walking path to the local beach which is beautiful but the climb back up to the road is tough. We ate in Roumeli’s next door often and Van and his team are so knowledgable and friendly helping with all questions about the area. We would most definitely recommend staying in this area and this villa. Response from Maria June 2022 Thank you so much for your beautiful 5 stars review  Shannon! Maria
548941697828257946,Maciej May 2022 This is as described. There's nothing better to find at this price. There were 14 of us. Room for everyone. Room next to a pool  perfect for gathering. Great location. A few great beaches within walking distance of your home. Restaurants right next to the house are very tasty and inviting. I'd recommend Translated from Polish  Show original Response from Maria May 2022 Thank you so much for your lovely 5 stars review and for having been one of our first guests at our new villa aliki!!
548941697828257946,Jasmin April 2022 Nice time  the villa is also very nice unfortunately the mattresses are very hard for my standards but everything else is perfect Translated from German  Show original Response from Maria May 2022 Thank you for your review  Jasmin!
50202490,Amit September 2022 The villa was perfectly amazing in the best place in Corfu. breathtaking view from everywhere you look  plus perfect swimming pool. the villa is equipped with every thing you can think of... Hans was great and avaliable for every question we had Really had the best time there... For sure It's highly recommended !!!!
50202490,Susie September 2022 Really enjoyed our stay at Villa Kalithea. The Villa was in the perfect spot to explore Corfu and the view was stunning. Hans went above and beyond in terms of communication throughout our stay which was really appreciated. The villa is situated towards the top of a steep hill with some hairpin bends so a car is definitely needed. Would thoroughly recommend Villa Kalithea and it would be the place I book again if returning to Corfu.
50202490,Gary August 2022 We had such an amazing stay at this beautiful villa  very well equipped with everything we needed! With a lovely pool and in a great location of the island and the views are spectacular! The pool was cleaned every morning and even sent in cleaners halfway through our stay! The hosts were very nice and helpful. Would definitely recommend!
50202490,Steven August 2022 Great Stay at the Villa Kalithea  Hans and Natasja were welcoming and available !
50202490,Anna July 2022 A great holiday destination. The villa was fantastic - beautifully finished and decorated  extremely well equipped  very comfortable  great pool  the most stunning view and a great location from which to explore the NE part of corfu. Hoping to come back next year. Thanks Hans and Natasja for accommodating us at short notice and for making sure we had a great stay.
50202490,Clare July 2022 Villa Kalithea is the most perfect Villa. The views are amazing and the Villa was clean very well equipped with a beautiful pool. It’s really easy to hire a boat from Nisaki and I would definitely recommend this as it’s a great way to visit other coves! Also definitely go snorkelling as the sea is crystal clear and we got to see an octopus! There are great places to eat in Nisaki and Kaminaki and The White House is beautiful! Thank you Hans for our lovely stay in your gorgeous Villa 👍😀 Response from Hans July 2022 Thank you very much Clare for this lovely review! We were very pleased to have you and your family as our guests and we are very glad you had a great time in our house and in Corfu! We would certainly love to receive you again in the future!

50202490,Helen June 2022 This Villa was just all in all perfect. Very clean and detailed! Kitchen had everything and the House had AC everywhere! The Owner was very communivative and kind. Although the view is breathtaking please be aware of the road up. Response from Hans June 2022 Thank you Helen  it was a pleasure having you and your party in our house! Have a safe trip home and maybe till some other time! Hans & Natasja
50202490,Amy June 2022 Beautiful home with stunning views  very clean and comfortable. Hans was very responsive to all of our questions. We had a great visit.

50202490,Maggie June 2022 This is an absolutely beautiful villa in a stunning location with far reaching views over the bay towards Corfu town. It is quiet and peaceful  just the place to chill out and relax. Inside it is obvious the villa has been furnished with great thought and care and to a very high standard. The kitchen is a dream and the shower rooms could be in a top boutique hotel. Hans and Natasja are very proud of it and it shows; plus they strive to ensure everything is just perfect  which it is. Communication with Hans was very easy and relaxed and we followed his advice and went to a few local taverns just a short drive away  we especially enjoyed Thalassa in Kaminaki and also the local bakery in Nissaki. We had a wonderful stay and highly recommend to other travellers. Response from Hans June 2022 Thank you very much Maggie  we were very pleased to receive you and have your feedback! Even more since you are an experienced Airbnb host as well and could share your experience and view on the house! Very helpful and we are very pleased you enjoyed your stay so much  thanks again Maggie! Hans & Natasja Show more
50202490,Julia June 2022 Villa Kalithea is an absolutely beautiful place. It is even prettier than in the pictures and is very well-equipped. Hans is a friendly and helpful host. The communication was always easy. Offering this great view  the Villa is quite up high on a mountain. We recommend renting a vehicle to get around. Response from Hans June 2022 Thank you very much for your kind words Julia! We were pleased to have you as our guests and certainly hope to receive you again! Thanks again Julia! Kind regards  Hans & Natasja
50202490,Edward May 2022 Beautifully furnished  spacious and clean. Incredible views and helpful hosts.
50202490,Julian September 2021 Simply put  perfect!  We stayed as a group of five adults (two couples  one single) and it was even more spacious than we had imagined. There are three separate bedrooms (two double rooms  one twin) and two separate bathrooms. The two double rooms even come with an optional sofa bed so the house can easily sleep up to 8 people. The bedrooms and bathrooms are downstairs which keeps them cool even on warm days. The small terrace adjacent to two of the bedrooms is a really nice touch.  Upstairs  where the main entrance is located  you will find a superbly (!!!!) equipped kitchen - to an extent I have never encountered in an AirBnB before. The main terrace is directly in front of the kitchen/dining area and was our typical dinner and evening hangout spot. The view across the sea is simply amazing!  Same view from the pool area  which is accessible via the front door and a small path next to the house. The pool has plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas. There is also a charcoal BBQ and another outdoor dining area. Way too many choices where to take your meals! ;)  The overall location is perfect if you want stunning views and don't mind a quick drive (or walk  but it's steep!) down to the beach.  Hans is a perfect host and made us feel very welcome. He was always reachable should there have been any issues (which was not the case). Check-in and check-out were easy via coded key box.  Recommended nearby activities: - Hike up Mount Pantokrator (follow the street behind the house) - Snorkel or SCUBA dive on the beaches beneath the house - Rent a boat for the day  also offered in Nissaki Port Show more Response from Hans September 2021 Dear Julian  thank you very much for your review! As we are working hard to make Villa Kalithea a top location  it is very nice to hear that our efforts are being so much appreciated! It was a real pleasure to have you and your friends as our guests! We hope to receive you again in Villa Kalithea! Show more
50202490,Pauline August 2021 The house is perfect ! We had a wonderfull week  perfectly located and with an amazing view. Perfect communication with Hans along the week.

Perhaps until another time! Hans
50202490,Carolyn July 2021 This is a beautiful villa  with excellent views. There was plenty of space for us (2 couples)  good sized rooms and two full baths  a well equipped kitchen complete with some snacks to get us started. The hill to get to the villa is steep  so be sure to have an appropriate vehicle. We had a great stay  thank you Hans!
50202490,Chantal July 2021 Wonderful house in beautiful Nisaki! Very spacious  very neat  3 large bedrooms  a fantastic kitchen  SMART TV for the kids  a washing machine and a pleasant and spacious terrace with soothing sea views. Of course  there is also a nice swimming pool to cool off. Also fun : from the living room you also have a view of the Pantokrator  the highest mountain on Corfu. So you are literally in the middle of the mountains and the sea. Communication with Hans was super efficient and reactive. Thanks so much Hans! Translated from Dutch  Show original
53761489,Satya August 2022 Excellent villa that served as the base for our visit to Corfu. The kids loved the beautiful pool. The location provides easy access to various parts of the island (10/15 mins from Corfu town) and beaches.  The host/owner were very helpful in organizing transfers  excursions  etc and made sure to check in multiple times to ensure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.

19919525,Giovanni August 2022 Both the owners and the property manager were super nice and welcome us to the villa.  The house was super clean  new appliances and we really felt like we were at home with all the comfort you may need.  The location is stunning  on a hill side with beautiful views from the garden and pool area - we have loved our barbecue by the pool.  The owners lives within the same complex which we thought was going to be a problem at first but they were barely ever at home and when we have met them my family enjoyed they company and thought there were super friendly people like you may expect from Greeks.  Overall  I would definitely recommend this stay and will hopefully come back next year.  Thank you very much for your hospitality from my family and I.

19919525,Marie August 2022 The place is the MOST BEAUTIFULL one to stay : my boyfriend and I can assure you. Iren  her husband and her sister are the kindest personnes we ever seen : they spoiled us the entire week. We felt better than home. Nethertheless : We had the entire place for ourselves ( the nice garden and swimming pool) except for two exceptional adorable kitties. (So in love with them) No need to say that we would love to come back there to get more rest … thank you again <3 Response from Iren August 2022 Thank you! You are most appreciated!
19919525,Iben August 2022 Iren and family are the most wonderful  welcoming and dedicated hosts  and they made sure that our entire stay  from planning to departure  went not only smoothly but well beyond our expectations.  As for the property  the photos do not give it justice. The area is beautiful and a perfect spot for exploring everything that Corfu has to offer for culture and nature enthusiasts  as everything on the island can be reached within an hour (we highly recommend renting your own car).  We have nothing but praise for the property and hosts  and hope to able to visit again! Response from Iren August 2022 Thank you! You have been fabulous yourselves! A true honour to have you over!
19919525,Malte September 2022 Iren and her family are the best hosts we could have asked for. They were very attentive  fulfilled every wish and thus allowed us two wonderful weeks. Although they live right next door  they were never intrusive and have placed great importance on respecting our privacy. We had the very well-kept garden  including large pool and beautiful views all to ourselves! A little tip: the house is on a hill and for exploring the island we definitely recommend a rental car. For a nice time in Corfu we can really only recommend Irens place to everyone! Translated from German  Show original

5465157,Becci September 2022 The perfect base for a couple of days exploring the south west coast. Easy access to the beach and tavernas  with a vibrant local town a short drive away. The flat was clean and beds were comfy. Garden area is beautiful!
5465157,Yvonne September 2022 Lovely quiet first floor apartment with a balcony with sea views  perfect for breakfast. Lovely secluded garden with a small rocky beach at the end. A sandy beach is only 150m walk and there is a very nice taverna where you can have meals overlooking the sea. Supermarket 15 minutes drive. Perfect place for a quiet relaxing holiday.
5465157,Romana July 2022 beautiful pieceful place  clean sea  private beach. Everything was perfect  I loved it. The owner is very kind. Just paradise ;-)
5465157,Christina June 2022 We had a great stay here. The garden is really beautiful and a relaxing place to sit in - the seating area looking over the stunning views was really quite exceptional. We stayed on the top floor of the house and loved sitting on the balcony looking at the views and listening to the birds. It was chilled out. The interior was clean and the kitchen  even though small  was well equipped. There is some parts that need updating  like one of the bathrooms/air conditioning unit  which we have let Ajax know about. The beach at the end of the garden is not like the picture presented either. It was more rocky than sandy  but there is Prasoudi beach which is less than 5 minutes walk away. The close by taverna was excellent. We loved exploring this part of Corfu - it was quite remote which is just what we wanted. Thanks so much again.
5465157,"Lynsey May 2022 The flat was pleasant and the balcony has a lovely view  but for a few reasons I would not stay here again. The pictures in the listing of ""direct access"" beach are not accurate / current so if you hope to spend some of your time close to home this is not possible  the hot tub was not warm enough to use (it was not summer when we visited) which was a disappointment and there were a lot of ants in the kitchen which was fine but bothersome - having some available eco ant traps would be helpful."
5465157,Dirk April 2022 Great appartement with a cute little garden and an amazing patio with a view of the open sea.
5465157,Hark April 2022 Top AirBnb!
5465157,Jörg October 2021 a dream of a place & a very good host Thank you Ajax
5465157,Max August 2021 It was a great stay. My family and I spent two weeks at the villa and did not want to leave it. The villa is located in a quiet area and consists of three rooms. The road to the village goes through an olive forest (you will need a car). The territory of the villa is very green. There is a shady area with sun loungers. A wonderful terrace directly above the sea  where you can watch the sunset at dinner (shared by all guests). Has its own access to the sea. On either side of the villa  one hundred meters away  there are two sandy beaches: wild and well-equipped. The equipped beach has two taverns. Vasily  the owner of the villa  is pleasant and always ready to help. He also lives in the villa. And Ajax is constantly in touch and answers any questions. Also  be sure to bring mosquito repellent with you.
5465157,Jenny July 2021 We had a brilliant 5-star stay  however it should be noted that this property is not the whole villa as was implied by the title when we booked. The house is split into the top floor (this listing)  and on the ground floor there is another Airbnb  as well as the owner Vasilis who also lives downstairs. The garden is shared. The photos could probably also use updating as there is no longer sand at the bottom of the stairs at the end of the garden  only rocks  so it’s quite pokey to get in and out. We experienced very few mosquitoes during our stay  but there were a lot of ants in the kitchen. Having said all that  these were all small blemishes on an otherwise fantasticly located apartment.
5465157,Attila July 2021 Awesome apartment with a huge balkony and beautiful garden. The location is perfect if you want peace and the beach nerby is one of the best in the island. Keep in mind that the closest shop (and city) is 5km so renting a car is a must.
5465157,Dror June 2021 We had a wonderful stay! The view is just amazing. We were a group of four friends and had a fantastic experience.
5465157,George July 2020 Amazing location!!! We'll be back!
5465157,Emily September 2019 Beautiful location  comfortable villa with incredible views the garden smeels and tastes amazing with fruit and flowers everywhere really nice jacuzzi and the choice of 2 beaches just a few minutes walk away. Great local restaurant and incredible sunsets. We were 6 people and other than the mosquito bites enjoyed every minute highly recommend this place
5465157,Hannah And Tony September 2019 This place is great if you’re looking for somewhere remote and peaceful. The garden is lovely and we were very well looked after by the owner and Ajax  especially when we needed help after a problem with the hire car (the roads are very tight so hire a small car if you can!). The beach at the end of the garden is lovely to go for a quick swim and prasoudi beach a few minutes walk away is great to go for the day  especially with the tavernas nearby.
5465157,Fatbardha July 2019 Lovely stay   loved the location . View from the house is spectacular   sea view from all balconies . Beach was almost private .
5465157,David April 2019 The pictures don't do this place justice.  We went off season and despite the not optimal weather condition  still thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The garden is very lovely  with so many nice touches in every corner.  We can't wait to come back.
5465157,Mihai September 2018 The pictures don't show how nice this place is :).
5465157,Jude July 2018 If you want to really enjoy the beauty of Corfu in a peaceful  quiet and natural setting then this is the place to be!  We chose this home because of its location  not the house itself. The outdoors are so beautiful. The house is functional  and clean.  Ajax was super attentive every step along the way. It was a pleasure from beginning to end! Thank you!
5465157,Thomas June 2018 The pictures don't do Villa Pelagos justice! It's such a beautiful property with astounding views. You definitely need to rent a car  and download all of Corfu's maps to your Google Maps if you use it. It helped us greatly while staying in Corfu. The restaurant that's a 2 minute walk up the street is amazing as well.
5465157,Floris June 2017 Cosy house next to the beach  beautifull garden  private spa. Need to rent a car. We had a wonderfull time
5465157,Tim June 2017 We loved the location  the host  the sea and beautiful garden.
5465157,Cécile October 2016 We stayed a week in this appartement and everything went well  it's a perfect place when the weather is nice but we were not lucky for that!
5465157,Siebe August 2016 <Reception was great  but the house itself was a bit disappointing. Outdated furniture  not everything in working order (a/c stove)  but a great view from the balcony.
5465157,Nurit July 2016 We enjoyed the stay at Ajax house. The house was very clean and comfortable and the garden is amazing. The area is quite and the beach was close to the house and amazing. We hope will come back in the future.
5465157,Bruna June 2016 The place where the house is is absolutely beautiful. It is direct by the beach. There are not many things around and the place can be hard to find so you will need a car if you want to go explore Corfu. If you just want to relax  the place is perfect. The house is simple and the highlight is the garden right in front of the beach. And the lovely balcony  of course.
5465157,Cédric September 2015 The location of the house is just amazing. Ajax was very helpful to give us information of the activies around Corfu. Thank you for your welcom.
5465157,Laurence August 2015 Fabulous  spacious apartment with stunning views. Perfect family location with two beautiful sandy beaches minutes from your front door. One beach has loungers  pedalo hire and kayak hire  and two restaurants  while the second is quieter  but long expanse of sand. Both were perfect for snorkelling too. The apartment itself has numerous balconies and amazing views of sunset. Whirlpool and loungers in the garden to relax and cool down. The very friendly owner lives downstairs and gave us amazing fresh tomatoes and peppers.
5465157,Fabienne May 2015 Everything was perfect (the booking communication  the house and apt.  the garden and the hosts)! We had a very pleasant stay! Thank you very much!
5465157,Hector September 2022 First of all  the apartment looks much better in the photo than when you arrived. We thought the house would be for us and there were other rentals downstairs and the owner. There was no hot water in the mornings and when I was there I didn't arrive for the 6 of us. Cooking and basic cleaning supplies were missing There are 6 beds but there was no room for 6 inside the apartment.  On the other hand  the exterior is beautiful. Magnificent views of the coastline. Vasilis' treatment was very good and so was Ajax. As for that  no objection. Translated from Spanish  Show original
5465157,Bibiana August 2022 Everyone has an idea of what an ideal vacation spot is: well  Melitio Pelagos' house is a great place for me to spend a few summer days! Quiet  secluded and green. Ajax is a very friendly and correct host Thank you Ajax for taking care of that beautiful place on the planet. Bibiana Translated from Spanish  Show original
5465157,Susanne June 2022 My somewhat inaccurate review is for a variety of reasons. The location and the balcony on the 1st floor are great. You have a beautiful view. The garden is also very nice. Communication: We were 4 people and 1 toddler  had the apartment on the 1st floor. The apartment has 2 bedrooms and a kitchen. What no one has told us is that the room (separate entrance door) belonged to our area. It would have been good to know. So the price was definitely too high.  Vasilis was very nice and helpful  we were just not sure if he always understood us.  Cleanliness: The floors were not very clean.  The overall decor is a bit outdated.  The direct beach is no longer available. A storm has completely flooded wide areas of the beaches. This should be included in the listing description. But there is a beautiful sandy beach in just 5 minutes walking. With tavern  loungers and parasols (6€/day for 2 loungers with umbrella. )  In principle  it is a very nice accommodation  but the price would have to be adjusted.

5465157,Bibiana September 2021 We spent wonderful days in this little paradise. It's a cozy house in a perfect location. It was annoying to us that the house was actually two separately rented apartments. Even though the shared use of the garden was smooth and straightforward  you should be aware that you are not completely alone here. I wish this was clearly described in the Portal in order to avoid disappointment and misunderstandings. If you like to cook  you will have problems here because of the lack of amenities. A nice caretaker ensures order and cleanliness in the garden and house. Ajax is a very friendly host. Translated from German  Show original
5465157,Robert May 2021 Super nice place. Beautiful beach within walking distance. Great view from the wooden terrace by the sea. We spent a week there and felt comfortable with the nice hosts. Translated from German  Show original
5465157,Bernd September 2020 Very likeable friendly  clean accommodation with beautiful garden and sea access (rocky but easily accessible)  completely quiet and beautiful sunset tavern a few minutes away. Extremely relaxing  friendly hosts. We felt exceptionally comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
5465157,Monssef August 2020 The accommodation is isolated from shops ( 45 minutes by car)  you must be driven! Until the last minute we didn't have an exact address and when we arrived at the airport the address we were given was not exact and so we took 3 hours for a 50-minute journey!! The person who received us was very unpleasant! The decor is quite old but overall clean. Access to the sea is the most important of this accommodation. A restaurant a two minute walk away is the only thing that can be done without a car and it is good quality despite the presence of wasps during the day and mosquitoes in the evening! Very difficult to enjoy the beautiful terrace in the evening except when the wind is blowing because there are really too many mosquitoes! Translated from French  Show original Response from Ajax August 2020 Dear Monseef   i hope you had a nice holiday in Corfu Greece and you are returning back home with nice family memories.  I´m really sorry to read  that you did not find the house straight. To all our guest we send the GPS coordinates and a detailed road direction with pictures. Online  on google maps customers can also find the house. Several years now  we did not have any troubles with the road directions.  Indeed you asked us several times  but what could we send you more informations for the road? We really tried our best... Once you arrived  we tried to give you the directions even by phone  after you informed us that you drive to the wring direction.  We wish you all the best and we would be happy if you visit us again. Than  i´m sure you will find the house more easy!  Sunny greetings from Corfu Ajax & Vasili Show more
5465157,Janina September 2019 We are very satisfied! We had the entire upper floor at our disposal with two bathrooms and a kitchen. The large balcony offers a wonderful view of sunsets in the sea. The accommodation is very loving and typical of the country. The apartment has good equipment for cooking. In addition  you really have your peace there! According to this  you also need a car to be able to reach supermarkets. The host was very friendly and accommodating. A restaurant is right nearby. Totally fine with the price. Absolutely fantastic is the beach adjacent to the garden  which you really have to yourself to swim in peace. We (4 girls from Germany) would be happy to recommend this accommodation.

5465157,Manuela May 2018 Surprisingly  we only had the upper floor. But this may also be because we may not have read it correctly. However  the advertisement gave the impression that you could use the whole house. Not enough equipment in the kitchen (only 2 cups  no bowls  etc.). The barbecue is in a separate room  so a cozy barbecue round is not possible. The hot tub is great and the direct access to the sea is great. The tavern right next door is also super delicious. There was almost always a contact person on site  which helped us a lot. The directions are also wonderful. Thanks again! Translated from German  Show original
5465157,David April 2017 Very nice stay! We particularly enjoyed the terrace  the sea view  the access to the sea  and the outdoor Jacuzzi. It must be said that we were out of season in early April and therefore alone in the house (we occupied an apartment and an additional bedroom/flat with access from the outside - the house still has another apartment that was not occupied). There are two restaurants nearby  but they were closed (we couldn't try it). Translated from French  Show original
5465157,Giovanna June 2016 The hosts were friendly and discreet  never intrusive. The description provided to me to get to the house was perfect. The house is in the Prasoudi area  very quiet: it is not a city or a village  but an agricultural area  especially olive groves  with a beautiful beach of rocks and sand (going out the bottom of the house's garden  with a private staircase you can go straight to the beach)  some houses  some taverns. The house is simply furnished  but there is everything you need  and its beauty is on the terraces: one is large and overlooks the sea  but it is never too hot; another serves as an entrance  and it is great to leave fins  masks  sarong  etc.  then two smaller terraces. The garden is also a small paradise  very well-kept plants  sunny and private at the same time; it has two showers hidden between the plants and two fountain washers  very useful and beautiful  and a jacuzzi lined with wood and surrounded by jasmine. I wasn't able to tell from the description that the hosts live on the ground floor  as it is  but that wasn't a problem. I'm very happy about my vacation. Translated from Italian  Show original
5465157,Jelsha Ueltschi September 2015 In advance  communication with Ajax was very accommodating  friendly  detailed and timely. Upon our arrival  the owner was on site and welcomed us very warmly. The apartment was tasteful and sufficiently furnished  the location really very nice. The garden and hot tub are maintained regularly  the apartment was clean. Unfortunately  however  there were several smaller things that did not work properly  such as the TV  light switches  coffee maker or mosquito gate. The owner Vasilis was on site every day  was always responsive and friendly and always took care of everything and tried to fix it according to his possibilities and within the next few hours. Overall  that was very thoughtful of him. We would also have appreciated if these things were checked and fixed prior to our arrival. Enclosed pans in the clutter-free cupboard are not drama  but they diminish the hosting level. After my two-week experience in Corfu  I have to consider the price for performance to be exaggerated. For so much money  I expect a higher standard in Greece! Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Hanna October 2022 We had a great stay with Lakis and Promitheus. Lakis was always very friendly to us and brought us wine and olive oil or a night ride home ;) The house and the garden are super nice and cozy and especially the nearby beaches and bays are very beautiful. By foot you are within 25-30 minutes in Agios Matheus where you can shop  hitchhiking also works great! Otherwise you can use the pickup service of the supermarket in Agios Matheus. The people in Agios Matheus are very friendly  we felt very comfortable. Especially recommended is the restaurant Rosina & Pavlos in Agios Matheus! :)
14791729,Marie September 2022 The house is wonderful and going to the west coast was the best decision because it is much less touristic and all the beautiful beaches and lagoons are on this side. The location couldn’t be better. Very calm environment  near to beautiful beaches and nature. Also near to taverns with good local food. The next supermarket in Agios Mattheos is a little step when you don’t have a car but the walking was no problem because of the wonderful surrounding. Agios Mattheos is also very beautiful little town with many cafes and restaurants and very nice people everywhere. The coop market in Agios Mattheos is offering free transfer from the house to the town in exchange of buying something in the market and the market has everything! From fresh meat to local products to vegan and vegetarian alternatives. If you want to see the island I would say a car is easier but Promitheus and the people on-site were very helpful on the days we hadn’t had a car. We decided to rent a car for just a few days and did it with no problems at the car rental in Agios Mattheos. All together it was a wonderful experience! Beautiful island  excellent food  hospitable and kind people and very nice atmosphere!
14791729,Roman August 2022 Everything was great. It’s lovely place for the vacation :) the owner was helpful with everything we asked. Car is requiered though  definetly rent some.
14791729,Judith August 2022 The environment is very quiet  nearby the beach and the garden is magnificent with lots of shadow. The house is rather basic and old.
14791729,Julia August 2021 It was a nice and cosy place. Very convenient  especially if you have kids. It was near beach Paramonas which was not crowded one. If i can say a negative thing it is every time you want to eat outside you need to keep your meal from the bees and the wasps.But that happened literally everywhere .
14791729,Radin July 2021 The house is very nice  clean and quiet. If you look for a place where you can disconnect and stay away from the tourist crowds this is your place. There are 2 beaches very close to the house - paramonas is organized with tavern and umbrellas. The other one is in a 10mins by foot  with a church and it is really great for kids. In only 10mins by car in direction to Lefkimi there is one really long sandy beach  again with very few people. Our stay was amazing. Thank you!
14791729,Agata September 2019 With three bedrooms and two bathrooms the house can comfortably accomodate two families. As mentioned before  it is not for luxury-seeking  but you get exactly what you see in the pictures. I enjoyed the place's kind of hippie  backpacker vibe and the cool shadow given by the trees in the garden. Having a beach in walking distance is also priceless. The biggest disadvantage for us (with small children and an allergic) were the enormous amounts of wasps  particularly problematic during meal times. It seems wasps are a thing on the whole island  but here the only table is located outside - which was equally nice and frustrating at times.
14791729,Vanessa July 2019 The house is located near the beach of Paramonas  about 5 min by feet. However we strongly suggest to rent a car in order to visit the rest of the island  which is full of amazing places and beaches. Near the house (about 5/10 min by car) there’s a small village where you can find supermarkets and cafes. The owner of the house lives near the location  so it’s easy to reach him if there’s any problem. The house is beautiful and perfect for a vacation with a group of friends  it has an amazing garden with lemon trees and the place is very quiet and relaxing. If you want to have a super fish dinner at a very low price while watching the sunset by the seaside go to Taverna Plori  which is only 5 min by feet on the beach of Paramonas.
14791729,Jenny July 2019 Xxx
14791729,Anna August 2018 A lovely clean place to stay  plenty of space  fresh linen and towels. We thoroughly enjoyed Paramonas the beach and local restaurants were fab. Our host excellent.
14791729,Konstantins July 2018 Lemonita is perfect choice if you tired of city bustle. We liked our cosy greek house with shady garden. There is no usual resort entertainment in Paramonas  but instead you can discover secret beaches  walk through olive groves  see the real Corfu nature  watch stars from the roof  swim before sunset and visit lovely nearest village with real  not resort life. Many thanks for Ajax for excellent communication and Lakis for hospitality.
14791729,Andreea June 2018 The house is as wonderful as the nature around. The beach is at 300m and the place is very quiet. The owner was friendly and the check-in is easy. The island is magnificent and I recommend to have a car to explore it. The phone signal is low around the house  but you will have coverage on the beach. Also the people from the restaurants in the area are very fiendly and the food is so good. I would stay again here.
14791729,Jens April 2018 everyting fine. Laki is a very nice guy and the village very sympathic. The garden and the terrace are beatiful  but when its cold or raining  there is little space to sit inside  what was a bit of a problem when being there in March / April. We simply did not fit into the living room. Very nice atmosphere  beatiful surroundings.
14791729,Achilleas September 2017 Super
14791729,Didier August 2017 The perfect place if you are in search of calm and a peaceful place  in a family house. I really enjoyed it. Excellent relationship.
14791729,Nathalie August 2017 We enjoyed very much our stay at Lemonita house  Lakis introduced us to the house and was a perfect host  very helpful and welcoming as well as Ajax always available if we needed information. We enjoyed the quietness of the house and lovely garden  the area is very nice between olive trees and the sea. The place is not very touristic yet  so very quite  you can reach several very nice beaches within walking distance  which is great. There is a nice village with grocery and bakery stores and tavernas very near  all very authentic and good. It turned out to be a real nice greek holiday experience for all the family.  Nathalie and family.
14791729,Raffaela September 2021 Small fine cottage with beautiful garden  close to the beach and very nice and helpful landlords! Thanks to Aiax and Lakis! Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Olivier August 2021 A perfect house to discover the less touristy South of Corfu and these wild nooks. Paramonas square and its taverna are very close by as well as a splendid little cove and its church a little further away. Lakis and Ajax are very readily available during the stay. The 3 bedrooms are spacious  all air-conditioned  and the small living room too. Beautiful garden. We were 4 adults and 3 kids and we had space. A very pleasant stay in a very nice place  thank you ! Translated from French  Show original
14791729,Miriam August 2021 Good location close to great beaches and a truly authentic Greek village  we enjoyed that very much. The house itself is simple and old and partly needs to get used to. There were such scent dispensers in all the plugs and cabinets  which we found disturbing. Cleanliness and communication were good  the landlord was responsive and took care of it. Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Sylvia July 2021 Very nice host on site  check in and check out without problems  Paramonas is a great place with beautiful beaches and not so crowded. Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Marta September 2019 We spent two weeks vacationing at Lemonita House and had a great time. The house is clean and comfortable and the owner is friendly and helpful. In a few minutes walk you can reach Paramonas Beach and Plori Tavern (recommended!). Other beautiful beaches are just a few miles away. The area is not touristy  immersed in olive trees  quiet  ideal for a relaxing vacation. The only drawback is the many vespas. Translated from Italian  Show original
14791729,Achim August 2019 A great place to stay for those who don't need much luxury. Simple but beautiful. Beautiful garden with a lot of shade  so it didn't get too hot outside either. Some clotheslines and a clothes rack are available  so you can always dry the bath linens well. The owner is very nice and accommodating. The beach is very easy to reach on foot. Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Melanie August 2019 House with beautiful garden within walking distance of Paramonas beach. Very nice beach  rather quiet and not crowded even in high season. Communication with hosts very good. Translated from German  Show original
14791729,Felicia July 2019 The interior is as shown in the photos  with some changes in the layout of the furniture and little else. The less enjoyable thing was that we couldn't enjoy the space outside the home as we imagined at the time of booking. In fact  the garden is in a state of total deterioration (sea lemons that have fallen and left on the ground  untouched plants  tubes and hanging wires). In addition to the presence of many mosquitoes  we have seen three times a mouse on the olive tree in front of the area for relaxation (practically under the wooden veranda  where you can also eat). Too bad because the apartment has all the potential to be a great place to stay. The beach  a few hundred meters away  is very nice and not very crowded. The local taverns are great. Recommended as a location for those who want to experience a non-touristy Corfu. Translated from Italian  Show original
14791729,Virginie July 2018 Sun on rendezvous. Verdant vegetation. Turquoise water beach. Excellent restaurant and the welcome of the population. A nice destination. Translated from French  Show original
14791729,Paul June 2018 House located in a very quiet and relaxing place. For the southern region it is very well located for beaches . Translated from French  Show original
14791729,Alice July 2017 The place was perfect for our family with three kids. The nearest beach is conveniently reachable on foot and there are other very nice beaches nearby. It is also advisable to have a car because the island is very nice to visit. Thanks to the location of the place  we were able to experience Corfu on a traditional and non-touristy side  just what we were looking for. Translated from Italian  Show original
34085136,Kseniya October 2022 Super
34085136,Lillian September 2022 The Apartment was really nice  it included everything we needed for our stay. Spacious  cute interior and a beautiful garden with figs  pomegranates  grapes and more. There is a car rental just 5 minutes down the road and a little groceries store is 100 meters away. Spyros is also a really nice guy  he helped us with everything. We could extend our stay spontaneously without problems which we are still really thankful for. We definitely recommend Spyros Apartment to anyone.
34085136,Maxence September 2022 perfect apartment for a short trip. The host is really nice and understanding. There are really good fruits in the garden. Thank you Spyros.
34085136,Natasa August 2022 Beautiful apartment in Ermones close to one of the best beaches on the island (Mirtiotissa beach for example). The garden has figs  grapes  apples and pears and the host told us we can take what we want. Kitchen offers all you need and the rest of the apartment is very nice especially the terrace!
34085136,Radu August 2022 We had a great time in a great location for a family of 4. We really liked the location because it was quiet and had a beautiful garden with delicious figs. We stayed for 10 days and we felt like home. Spyros was a great host  offering us all the information we needed about the places to eat.
34085136,Elisa August 2022 Very nice and clean apartment  easy communication. Thanks for the lovely stay.
34085136,Dennis July 2022 Super
34085136,Aliaksandr July 2022 This place is totally worth it! It's really cool  own apartment with a garden and bbq zone  located not far from several beaches. The description fully matches the apartment. Also special thanks to Spyros that he supplied us with ice cold water  some pasta and cookies when we arrived.
34085136,Yuval June 2022 perfect location in between the west beautiful beaches and Corfu town  well equipped appartment for a couple (plus a baby). The host was very responsive and helpful.
34085136,Daumantas June 2022 Great place  great host. Plenty of hiking trails and beaches nearby.
34085136,Valentina August 2021 Spyros is a great and kind host who gave us everything we needed and all the information we asked. The house is lovely and very well equipped (there are even umbrellas for the beach). We surely recommend it!
34085136,Michelle July 2021 The flat looks exactly as shown on the pictures :) it‘s super cozy and sweet! The location is wonderful quiet and the view is amazing. You have everything close by - with a car you can reach all the spots very quickly! Spyros is very friendly and supporting. We would love to stay there again and can recommend the place very highly.
34085136,Yuliya July 2020 Amazing apartment and location! Very cosy and stylish. You have everything you need: fully equipped kitchen and bathroom (shampoo  shower gel)  washing machine.. The Ermones beach is 1 5 km (20 minutes walk) away. The host did his best to meet our special needs. We had wonderful time here! Highly recommended!
34085136,Milena September 2019 We had a lovely vacation at Spyros' place. The apartment is in very good condition and had everything we needed. The garden is wonderful - with nice trees like apples and figs and amazing sunsets! We also could use the barbecue. The place is overall very quiet and tranquil. Still there are some mini markets and a good restaurant around the corner. Spyros provided us with all the information we needed to get around. As he advised we rented a scooter just from nearby so we could see more from the island and have better access to more beaches. If we go to Corfu in future we would love to stay again at Spyros' place.
34085136,Ludivine August 2021 Very nice apartment with a very pleasant exterior  responsive and attentive hosts. Recommended ! Translated from French  Show original
35957829,Alexandru September 2022 Alexandros and his father are great hosts and very nice people. The apartment is cozy  stylish and clean and the view from the balcony is gorgeous. Highly recommended!
35957829,Alice June 2022 Beautiful views  a nice small apartment with all the essentials ! All you could need for a short trip in Benitses. Up on a hill  be prepared for a steep walk (but nice one!) if you don’t have a vehicle :) would recommend !!
35957829,Alex May 2022 It was a nice and clean apartment  completely like the pictures. Alexandros and his Father where super kind to us ☺️ The View was amazing. You can walk to Benitses but we would recommend to rent a car. All in all a we had a really nice Time there 😊
35957829,Konstantin April 2022 Great apartment with an amazing view. We had a very pleasant stay. Benitses is a really lovely village with nice restaurants.
35957829,Ioana October 2021 We can recommend Savvatis apartments 100%. Communication was very friendly and efficient  Alexandros father Fotis was very caring and a good host. The apartment was very clean and had a nice view. Sun was shining into athe rooms in the morning. The location is very quite but also not too far from the city-although a car is highly recommended in order to reach the nicer beaches on the westcoast.
35957829,Saskia September 2021 The flat is very nice and comftable. The view from the balcony is very peaceful. There is a small but expensive super market in town with the most common supplies. We cooked almost every day and the kitchen was equipped good enough. There are many small beaches around Benitses which can be easily reached with the bus number 6 or are in walking distance. To access the most beautiful beaches in the west and north it is recommendable to rent a car. We enjoyed our stay!
35957829,Paul June 2021 Alexandros's place was a total pleasure as a base to enjoy the magic of Corfu. The location on a hill offered a mesmerizing view of the village and sea below. The amenities in the apartment were very good and the hosts were very friendly and helpful in every way.
35957829,Olga September 2020 It was fantastic holidays and the best place we ever stayed. House located in a beautiful place. Eucalyptus and tall pine trees create private and very quite surrounding. House is comfortable and has everything we needed for quality rest and relaxation. Special thanks to host and his father (Mr Photis) for hospitality  traveling tips  and assistance. For us it was the best holiday and hope to be back next year. Highly recommended !
35957829,Katarzyna August 2020 Cosy and really clean place  would recommend anyone  10/10 :)
35957829,Tomáš August 2020 Nice accommodation with amazing balcony view  rooms with air condition. Calm location and very kind host.
35957829,Piotr July 2020 I can recommend in a 100%
35957829,Atanas January 2020 The house is in a quiet place  surrounded with a great trees  with amazing view. The apartment is with new furniture  clean and bright. There was nothing to miss us and we have got very nice vacation. The host is very polite and responsive. Thanks!
35957829,Nicola August 2019 We had a fantastic holiday at Alexandros house! The house has everything you need and a beautiful panorama. It is also in a perfect position to visit the entire island. The host and his father help us in various moment. We ask for the hairdryer and the host’s father bought us a new one. Very recommended!
35957829,Aleksandar July 2019 One of the best accomodation we have ever stayed at. Everything is new  very clean  and you have everything you need  including air conditioner. The host is very kind  parking space is in backyard  it's very peaceful and guiet and the view is absolutely amazing! We hope we will come again next year
35957829,Mario October 2022 One word to describe the stay : Perfect. Peace  location  welcome ... I don't think it's better in Corfu. Translated from Italian  Show original
35957829,Alain July 2022 Beautiful apartment in a good location. Great place for four. Very well equipped. Very clean. Friendly hosts +++. A very pleasant stay on the island of Corfu. Translated from French  Show original
35957829,Ivana July 2022 We had a wonderful holiday in Corfu. The place was great with a great view. I would definitely recommend this place and also definitely go to Faliraki beach bar where we went for swimming and eating. The sea was clean and warm We would love to go back someday. :-) Translated from Slovakian  Show original
35957829,Jacqueline June 2022 Our stay at Alexandros place was amazing. The apartment is beautiful  large  clean and stylishly furnished. You will find everything you need (for example  also for cooking). Also the air conditioner works perfectly. We traveled with a 2-year-old child and everything was great for him too. A big thank you for that. Alexandros' family is warm and we always had a friendly contact person. We really enjoyed the trip and wish Alexandros' family the best. Translated from German  Show original
35957829,Ирина October 2021 Spent two wonderful weeks in Corfu. The place was booked in advance  Alexandros responded quickly  wrote all the necessary additional information before the trip. When choosing a place  we looked at the north  south  west and east coast  and are very glad that we chose Benicas. We were by car  drove through the entire island  here was the optimal combination of opportunities for us to walk  swim and drive around historical places. We drove to Kerkyra several times (only 10 km). The house is on a hillside with a stunning view of the sea  in the photo  maybe it's not that visible  in reality it's just incredible! Big balcony with one love view! The apartment is very convenient  comfortable  cozy  functional  clean  (it was important for us to have two separate rooms)  a good small induction stove  and there is everything you need. Such a secluded place in the resort infrastructure. The house has a large area with old olives  cypress trees  plenty of parking space. In the evening - silence  at the bottom of the lights of the port  the sea... You can swim in almost any place on the coast  from the house go not far  but back this road with a small climb  10 minutes walk. If there is a path down to the shore from the road  there is probably a cozy swimming cove. The water is clear and the bottom is a large pebble. For those who love beaches - all beaches are free  there are many  there are few people. We rented a car  so we combined traveling and swimming in small coves. The house is taken care of by the father of Alexandros  energetic and friendly  you can always contact him if necessary. All in all it was a great choice for us  would recommend 100% Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
35957829,Patrick September 2021 I will recommend Alexandros place to anyone. The location of the apartment was good  so the apartment of the size accurately for 3 people 🙂 you can enjoy very nice views of the city directly on the balcony. Also  we have such a feeling that we are with our Greek family. Always happy to come back!! ☺️ Translated from German  Show original

35957829,"Hannelore Maria November 2020 The house in which the cozily furnished apartment is located is absolutely quiet in the middle of a large property covered with old cypresses and olive trees. From the sunny balcony you have a fantastic view of the beautiful old trees and the Ionian Sea. To emphasize is the extraordinary warmth with which we were welcomed and taken care of during our stay. We also got great tips for hikes in the nearest area  which we made extensive use of. The village of Benitses with good shopping for everyday needs is within walking distance of the apartment. Benitses is a very good starting point to explore the whole island. You can quickly reach Corfu city by bus and the central bus station of the ""Green Buses"" with which you can travel the whole island. We felt very comfortable with Alexandros and would be happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original"

30463198,Oleg May 2019 View is great  location is comfortable  beach and golf are closely  owners are hospitable
30463198,Jesus July 2022 Villa highly recommended for everything. It is in the middle of the countryside  very close to the main road towards Ermones. Total peace of mind. In full contact with the environment. Very large plot with very well-kept garden  barbecue and nice porch. Very good location  in the middle of the island  to be able to explore all the areas with not excessively long trips. Well connected to the capital and beach areas. Two air-conditioned rooms and a third with a fan. Very spacious and comfortable living room. Warm welcome of spirits  at our disposal for any eventuality. We were very comfortable. Translated from Spanish  Show original
30463198,Michael August 2021 We had a lovely time in Ermones. Boat rental right on the beach  great bays. However  you should invest the 20-minute proximity to the airport for shopping. You can get small things on site. Translated from German  Show original
30463198,Javier September 2019 We have spent 10 days in September at Villa Lisa  we are a couple with 3 children (15  14 and 11 years old). The truth is that our stay has been perfect. We wanted a quiet house  close to some beach  and well located to be able to explore the island by car  and Spyros's house has more than met our goal. The house is spacious  comfortable and well equipped  everything works very well. As in many other sites on the island there are mosquitoes. The house is well protected with mosquito nets on all doors and windows and several repellent electrical devices. The plot is spacious and very well cared for. If you are looking for a quiet but well-connected place  it is the ideal place. Translated from Spanish  Show original
50409883,Luisa September 2022 Helen has been a very nice host  she was very kind and she made us feel at home. The house seems bigger in the picture but overall it does not matter as everything was perfect  we had everything we needed such as washing machine  hairdryer and iron. The beds were comfortable and when it got cold Helen brought us blankets. Moreover  the house was very clean and she cleaned it every 2 days. There is also a smart TV on which you can play some music or watch Netflix. Response from Dimitra Eleni October 2022 Thank you Luisa for your kind words! We are glad that you enjoyed your stay in our house. You are always welcome!

Not far from the beach and you don’t hear the noises of the clubs. We especially enjoyed the evenings on the really beautiful terrace. Would recommend! Response from Dimitra Eleni September 2022 Thank you Kim for your kind words! You are always welcome to our house.
50409883,Lea October 2022 Helen was attentive and very helpful  she was able to respond to our requests immediately. The welcome was warm  with special touches for each person present.

53763703,Elizabeth September 2022 Fabulous Holiday at Kristeffi. Ample room for 6 adults The listing is very accurate. The Villa was spotlessly clean and very big Pool area is a great sun trap and very relaxing. Not many restaurants with out a 25+ minute walk. It’s very hilly. Views are stunning.

53763703,Melanie July 2022 We had a fantastic 10 days at Villa Kristva. The house is so spacious that even with eight guests it feels roomy. The location is ideal for exploring the island  and the shop  cafe and restaurants in walking distance of the house are really useful.

53763703,Edward May 2022 My party and I stayed at Villa Kristefi for 6 days and could not believe how great value this Airbnb was.  As we had a car rental  we had a little difficulty locating the villa at first but when we pulled into the wrong drive  the locals were very friendly and offered directions to help us out!  The house itself is incredible  with a very spacious kitchen/living room and enough bedrooms to sleep 8 comfortably. The view from the house was stunning and looks out onto the wonderful mountains of Corfu. The pictures do not do it justice!  Situated about a 20-minute walk from the local beaches  I would recommend car hire as it made navigating the island a lot easier. However  there is a small strip of shops/bars/cafes about a 5-10 min walk from the house that we frequently visited and were always pleased by the friendly staff and cheap drinks! We also walked to the strip of Ypsos where there are many bars and restaurants to visit and cabs are very easy to book.  Sofronios was always quick to respond to any problems we had and the house was even cleaned during our stay which was very nice.  Corfu is an amazing holiday destination  with boat trips to Paxos/Antipaxos  tours of Old town Corfu  and a visit to Palaiokastritsa being my most recommended highlights!  Thanks to Eos villas  the trip couldn't have gone smoother and I would strongly recommend Villa Kristefi as a holiday destination. I would love to do it all again!

8640448,Elif September 2022 We had a great stay at Georgia’s apartments  she was always helpful  thoughtful  giving local advises and being flexible on our needs. Location is exactly as mentioned. Walking distance to a small local beach and surrounded by short drive distance beauties. Both Georgia and her husband took very good care of us. Definitely recommended!
8640448,Sebastian July 2022 Lovely Stay in Athinas Place. The location was great  right in the montains with perfect sunsets from the terrace/Balkony. You have nice beaches All around ( Elmones/glyfada/palekas). Athina organized a bike for us ( they brought it there  costed much less than in the rentals). You can ask Athina everything and she will always help. Also she cleaned up the room every day. Just a perfect place and host to stay  she will make you smile every day.  Vanessa / Basti
8640448,John July 2022 Good clean apartment with great virw from balcony
8640448,Lukas June 2022 Athena and her Hausband are very nice and heartwarming people. We really enjoyed to stay here!  Small simple Apartments  exactly as seen on the photos.
8640448,Keran October 2021 If you have the chance to stay at Athinas place  just do it. She is such a caring person. The rooms are nice and the Walk to the nearest beach is only 15mins. Absolutely recommend!
8640448,Claudia October 2021 A super-nice host and a very confortable apartment with a nice balcony with a view on the valley
8640448,Dorian August 2021 Great apartment. Athina is a very kind person. She always gave us very good tips for excursions. We had a great time at Villa Georgia  gladly again.
8640448,Alina August 2021 Athina is a very loving and caring hostmum. She is happy to answer all questions and is always there for her guests. For example  she organized us a motorcycle  although in August at peak season actually all motorcycles were fully booked and even reserved us tables in the surrounding taverns. Her husband even cooked calamari for us! The room is freshly renovated  the balcony is very nice. Athina and her husband grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables on their property  which were offered to us. Especially the figs are super tasty. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the beach  so you have to rely on a car or motorcycle. We thank Athina for the wonderful time and her always caring  happy way. We will be happy to come back again!
8640448,Amandine June 2021 Perfect night at Villa Georgia. Athina’s warm welcome made us feel at home as soon as we arrived. The bed was really comfy and the shower had great water pressure. Have a look at the balcony  the view over the mountains and Athina’s garden is lovely.
8640448,Huw September 2020 Well for starters this is much less of an Airbnb stay and more like a very attentive hotel. Athina and her husband are incredible hosts and the touches across the entire apartment are outstanding. Honestly I’d be impressed if this was a hotel. Sparkling clean  all the amenities you could need  stunning property and in very likely one of the best locations on the whole island. We instantly adored Athina and followed her great local advice everyday and had the most wonderful trip. I recommend hiring a car to explore the island. Definitely recommend and looking forward to heading to back to Villa Georgia myself!! 5 stars all the way.
8640448,Catherine September 2019 The place is super nice and Athina is the most welcoming host. I loved staying there and will definitely come again!
8640448,Giuseppe September 2019 Athina's accomodation corresponds exactly to what is described on the site. It is comfortable  very clean and equipped with all the accessories. In our absence Athina provided to clean it every day  to take away the garbage and once to change our sheets and towels. Athina was very kind and nice  willing to give us all the information we needed. On the day of check-out she even suggested us to keep our luggage and she made us avalaible the shower in her house if we had decided to spend the day on the beach before heading for the airport. What do you want more? Thanks Athina  thanks again!
8640448,Maud August 2019 Very good place near the best beaches and very quiet. Easy To park the car and easy To access.
8640448,Claudia Livia August 2019 We spent a wonderful week at Athina's place. She is the most welcoming host one could wish for! She lent us some beach equipment we forgot at home and she had great reccomendations for exploring the island!  The place is very spacious   clean and the kitchen has everything we needed. Some great beaches are nearby  by car only 5 min away! We would definitely come back !
8640448,Austin July 2019 I was traveling alone and she made me feel at home and told me if I ever got stuck on my travels I could always reach out to her. Wonderful lady and a wonderful home.
8640448,Ido May 2019 Athina is a friendly  very generous and professional host  and her place is really beautiful.
8640448,Pascal And Lauren October 2018 would stay again....athina is lovely and thoughtful.
8640448,Lorenzo August 2018 Everything was great! Athena is a very good and kind host!! Absolutely great!
8640448,Alex September 2017 Athina is such a lovely lady. She owns and runs 6 apartments in a very big villa with plenty of parking spots. She treats all the customers with a lot of respect and gives very good recommendations where to go out or places to visit (better than a tourist information office). She's very easygoing and likes chatting with all customers.  The thing that I really liked about Athina is that she tidies up all 6 apartments every morning when all the occupants are out. She really cares about the wellbeing of her customers.  Finally the location is ideal as it is close to the nicest beaches of the island.  I highly recommend Athina's place  it is the best place in Corfu.
8640448,Enrico August 2016 I spent really nice time in Georgia house (close to Glyfada and Myrtiossisa beach). The room was clean and with outdoor space. Athina was very very kind with me ;) Thanks a lot Athina! Fully recomended
8640448,Marina September 2022 At first we got the wrong address so I'm Athina came to pick us up. Fresh water  coffee  and homemade cake upon arrival! Very convenient location to visit the whole island but the most beautiful beach (paralia myrtos) is only a 20 minute walk or 10 minute drive. Super hospitality: Coffee and sweets were waiting for us every day. Between a hotel and a guest-house Villa Georgia takes the best of both: reimagined beds every day  the host is always available for any questions or needs  friendliness and infinite conviviality  without expiring the intrusion. Ample parking. Very comfortable mattresses. Translated from Italian  Show original
8640448,Sophie August 2022 The stay at Athina's place was wonderful. A very very friendly woman  who had taken all our questions and requests into account. In advance  we could rent a scooter through Athina and the taxi to the airport was also easily organized by her. The apartment had a great view of the country of Corfu. The room was very clean and was cleaned daily by Athina  the garbage was changed  the bed made and the dishes washed as well. The apartment is located on a main road to the path to Glyfaya Beach  is therefore relatively busy  which did not bother us particularly. Loud were the dogs around  who barked a lot in the evening and at night. But with the window closed  this was also no problem. We took 5 minutes by scooter to Glyfaya Beach and even shorter to Mirtiotissa Beach. A small place called Pelekas is 8 minutes by scooter and has great restaurants and a small supermarket. Corfu town is 26 minutes away.  Through Athina's open-minded nature  she made our vacation perfect  we had a great time in Corfu and in the apartment! Show more Translated from German  Show original
8640448,Ruben September 2021 The Airbnb is small but nice! Sufficiently equipped. If you are on the beach all day or out and about like us  it is perfect. Bathrooms are renovated  location: right by the most beautiful beaches in Corfu. 25 min to Corfu city center. Athina cleans the rooms daily and even wash the dishes. Truly a sweet  helpful grandma. We have recommended them to our friends with a clear conscience. Translated from German  Show original

8640448,Hélène June 2018 Athina offers apartments overlooking the corfu mountains - an ideal trundle on a hike ! The place is very quiet and Athina's garden is very beautiful. The aesthetic of the studio is a little old-fashioned but it doesn't matter  because Athina is very careful to make us have a good stay and everything is very well maintained. We are not far from Pelekas ( 30 min walk )  Agios Gordios and some very pleasant beaches ( less touristy ). Recommended ! Translated from French  Show original
8640448,Erica August 2016 A heartfelt thank you to the wonderful hosts  Athina and Spyros  who welcomed us with open arms and made us feel like family.

685286537378087641,Dominik October 2022 It was a beautiful vacation!  The island is very nice to explore by car and Corfu Town is a cute old town with lots of restaurants  cafes and shops.  The house is very cute and invites you to linger.  The adjacent garden and the direct access to the sea were fantastic.  Unfortunately  the main street is right next to the house  but that didn't bother us anymore after 2 days. You get used to the noise.  The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating.  We'd love to come back!
685286537378087641,Rasmus October 2022 This place  at Giorgos’ and Malama’s  is magical! First and foremost ’cause they are so wonderful people. The best of vibes! The old horse stable which is newly renovated with great vision and flair for detail  is a wonderful place to be. With the beach and the ocean just outside the door  it feels like an oasis of your own. Your hosts are welcoming  friendly and stand by if you need anything. I highly recommend this place ❤️
685286537378087641,Emily September 2022 It is a beautiful house right next to the Beach. We loved our stay and would recommend to rent a car to see the beautiful island. Korfu city is about 10-15min away. Thanks for the great stay! The house is full of little lovly details and very clean!
685286537378087641,Lisa September 2022 It’s a bit tricky to write this review. On one hand I want to give Malama and Giorgos the wonderful feedback they deserve and yet make sure that it won’t be overbooked when I wanna come back. 😉  So short version: this place is a real treasure  wonderful design  much love for details and obviously decorated by someone with an eye for aesthetics.  It’s wonderfully located close to the airport and Korfu town.  Malama and Giorgos are wonderful people with a strong sense of hospitality  felt like visiting a friend rather than staying in an Airbnb.  The house is cozy and offers everything to make you feel at home. They also have a lovely collection of inspiring books.  So even the details are well thought through.  I can only recommend this place from the bottom of my heart.  Thank you 🙏🏻 for everything ♥️ Show more

52085040,Elisa August 2022 the apartment is beautiful the garden amazing the matress very comfortable. the village is very characteristic silent and relaxing. just consider that is much better to rent a car or a scooter at least  because it is on the top of a hill  45minute walking from the sea.
52085040,Cato August 2022 Very nice stay! The appartment is beautiful and the location is perfect if you rent a scooter. Very close to the cross section to the best beaches. The village is cute. Our host was very kind and helped us going to the airport. Definitely recommend this place!

We have loved our time here. We will definitely come back here.
52085040,Céline July 2022 We had a wonderful time at the Little House. The garden is the paradise! There is an incredible amount of heart throughout the property  making the atmosphere even more beautiful. Jojo is a fantastic and very warm hearted person and has been a great help to us in many things. The furnishings of the house are modern and you definitely have everything you need. In the village there is a great taverna where we had the best food! We were treated with open arms by the people in the village. They’re all so lovely. Corfu city is easily reachable by car within 30 minutes and also beautiful beaches are nearby. A car is definitely recommended. But even the bus lines seem to be very reliable… we never tried it. On the main road there is a fantastic cafe where there is very delicious coffee  ice coffee and sandwiches. We can only recommend the Little House  It was a PERFECT holiday. We are in love and will definitely come back! Thank you Jojo for everything! xx Céline & Ahmed
52085040,Nikki July 2022 Little house is a little gem. We loved our time there! It was perfectly clean  spacious  and a nice cool retreat from the extreme heat when needed. It's even better in real life than in the pictures  and the garden is incredible. We'd happily have sat out there every evening with the mountain view over dinner  were it not for the equally wonderful Taverna in the village square just a stone's throw from the house. Jojo is a great host too. It's a 5* place for sure  and we'd happily return. Thanks for all! Nikki & Pablo xx
52085040,Jakub July 2022 A fairy-tale place away from the hustle and bustle. We recommend it to all those who value the peace of a small village. Great location and access  bus stop 8 minutes from the cottage  bus only about 35 minutes from the center of Kerkira. The house was prepared wonderfully  cleanly  with attention to small  pleasant usability. The house has a comfortable  separate day zone where you can spend time pleasantly  it is cozy but spacious and even in the hottest heat it is still cool inside. A beautiful garden with a few nice places to spend time on slightly cooler evenings. The host is happy to share very useful tips and destination recommendations. We sincerely recommend and we already dream of returning to this place .. Thank you for the wonderful hospitality :)
52085040,Marta June 2022 This place is a real pearl. Very spacious and in a great location - super close to all the beaches of the western coast. The rustical style and lovely garden will let you to properly rest in this little paradise.

52085040,Elisabetta June 2022 charming place. essential house  well placed in the context of the village to which it belongs. the country is magical: people not only hospitable but really all very friendly. Just above the house is the small square with a food-bar that is mythical. You eat well. A few dishes well cooked with an exceptional value for money  as is the apartment. Amazing garden  well kept and very flowery. JoJo  who welcomed us  immediately solved some problems by showing great availability and fun. The area where the house is located is the most beautiful in Corfu: dazzling green  bright colors and really appetizing sea. You can reach several coves on foot that are true masterpieces of nature. In short  10 and praise!! Translated from Italian  Show original

Adisa was a great host  helping us with any help we needed and answering very fast. The bedrooms were clean and very comfortable  and the entire house had air conditioning. Fully equipped kitchen for anything you might wanna cook or prepare. Awesome accomodation and beautiful sandy beach with supermarkets close by. Totally recommend it.

22594117,Dan June 2022 The pros: the house is part of a compound which is marvelous  very green  all villas have a good sea view due to the houses positioning on the hill  the beach is nice and from our place you could reach it within less than 5 minutes. The houses  though  are quite different and in different condition  as much as we could observe from outside  some seemed very well taken care of  some needed refurbishment. Ours definitely was very nice back in its time  spacious  with lots of storage spaces and big  airy rooms  with a nice balcony and a small terrace outside. Beds were nice and very comfy.  The less happy impressions : ): I believe that with little effort this place could be very good value for money; now it's not. Cleaning was not at the expected standards  especially in the kitchen; then  one bathroom had an issue with the hot water  the other had an issue with the drainage; the bathrooms looked old  accessories cheap and quite used; same impression in the kitchen  with the furniture and fridge. The oven was not working. The kitchen had just 3 small cups for hot beverages and would benefit from more cooking and serving accessories. The balcony in the villa next to ours had a nice shade  ours did not  so it could only be used in the evening. In the small yard in front  there was no grass  no plants  it looked sad and we did not use it much. The evening before leaving they came and brought some big plants and placed them around the house  to us it seemed like they were only getting ready for the next guests. :-) The internet was not properly working  they promised an additional device which never came.  Generally speaking Adisa was very responsive to our complaints and tried to make things better with the bathrooms (managed with one of them) and replaced one old and broken umbrella. We also appreciated the quick cleaning and towels changing that was done after 2 days. Show more

22594117,David September 2021 We wholly enjoyed our stay with the Menigos Resort. What’s not visible from the original pictures is that it’s part of entire property complex with many different small to large houses you can rent. We came a bit earlier which was no problem and we even got a free upgrade by chance. If you have the chance to book a beach front house  do it 😊 the beach is clean and the water is super clear. Highly recommend to stay here.
22594117,Michael August 2021 Great place for family escape…especially with small kids The house is comfortable with relatively easy (20 steps down the hill) to the beach…beautiful see and from 5 to 50 minutes drive the most attractions….as an advice better rent a car….to be more flexible Response from Adisa August 2021 Hello dear Michael   Thank you for being here .

22594117,Yusuf September 2022 good location   recommend Translated from German  Show original
22594117,Ioannis August 2022 The house was not nearly as described. The kitchen cabinets were moldy  the dishwasher did not work  the bathrooms were totally outdated  the gaps were just disgusting. The sink fixtures could not be used without there being half a flood in the bathroom. The cleaning was only carried out after a complaint and after a second unsuccessful attempt to repair the dishwasher we were told to live with it. The only thing good was the view... this was unfortunately restricted by a rickety TV bowl. I absolutely can't understand how this house could only get a good review at all. Absolutely not recommended. The price is a cheekiness for such a place!! Fingers crossed!! Translated from German  Show original Response from Adisa September 2022 You long comment is not fair at all . You stayed in our house for 14 nights   on 13-th night late afternoon   you suddenly reminded that the house what not as you expected and you had so many problems . Not in the second night   not in the third   not even on 7 -th night   but one night before your check out . We have been in contact with your lady all time   and yes one thing is true the problem of the dishwasher . Your lady informed 2 times that is not working and us 2 times we sent the technician to check and 2 times said yes is working . After we paid 2 times for nothing   your lady informed that was a misunderstanding   was working the dishwasher but was not cleaning good . So all your comments are a big lie   and the only purpose from you was to take 1000 E refund . If you could inform us in the first 2-3 days   i would understand . But after 2 weeks   one day before your check out   you noted all the problems and asked 1000 E and threatened us you would gave the worst review if we didnt refund you 1000 E . And here you kept your word !!!!! Greetings from Corfu !! Adisa & Staff Show more

33124805,Helen October 2022 Absolutely loved this place  had a fabulous time with our family.
33124805,Kay September 2022 This is a wonderful house to share with friends. It has four bedrooms with connecting baths. It has a beautiful  well equipped open kitchen and contemporary bathrooms and lots of indoor and outdoor sitting spots to spread out and enjoy the pool and magnificent views! A lovely combination of Greek villa and modern amenities. We had three couples sharing and it worked out great.
33124805,Xavier Et Elise August 2022 The house is perfectly located with stunning views. It is quiet and has everything you need to spend wonderful holidays. Elise et Xavier
33124805,Louise August 2022 This villa is away from the more crowded beach areas with the most stunning views from both sides of the villa. Spiros was always extremely helpful with annof our questions. We have enjoyed our stay in Corfu.
33124805,Helen July 2022 This is a beautiful villa with amazing views in all directions . It has lots of lovely outside areas to sunbathe  sit and eat and enjoy the views and. Fabulous pool . The area is beautiful but you do need a car to get around . There are lots of lovely beaches and great places to eat .
33124805,Deb July 2022 Absolutely gorgeous and a lovely  quite location.
33124805,Nimo June 2022 This place is amazing  and the view is everything. The pool is private. The host was very helpful and kind. We loved everything about the villa  it is close to many beautiful beaches.  Would really recommend it!
33124805,Jim June 2022 Lovely scenery; superb villa! If anything the pictures and the description are understated! Can’t be faulted. You do need a car  but a beautiful village at the bottom of the hill with a few shops and restaurants is just 5 minutes away with a bigger town just 15 minutes. Kids of 11 and 17 had a great time in the pool and playing pool (the pool table was a very welcome surprise). Spiros provided great directions and tourist information and a very warm welcome. Looking forward to an opportunity to go back!
33124805,G May 2022 After reading the reviews and seeing the pictures of the Villa we knew we had booked a real gem of a property but we were overwhelmed when we arrived to what awaited us. The villa was just beautiful inside and out  the pool and BBQ area were fantastic (we travelled as 4 adults + 16 and 12 yr old daughters).. the accommodation was right up our street  decorated so tastefully and had all the modern amenities you need. Two bedrooms in the main house so was perfect for our 12 year old and we had the super large bedroom beside her. On the lower ground was a fab little mews that our friends had (bedroom  bathroom and mini kitchen)  and the treat was our 16 yr old had her little own apartment on the ground terrace so she had her own space  perfect... Each area of the villa had a different terrace on different levels with panoramic views of Kalami and further  even your could see towards Corfu Town  this was the breath-taking  we did not want to leave. Spiros was a fabulous host  communication was 10/10  arrival basket of treats to get us started was so thoughtful  all his guidance on the locality and where to eat and visit were spot on  we cannot thank him enough.. and not to forget to mention the kindest and loveliest of cleaners  they were all so wonderful   all in all probably the best AIRBNB we have had so far and we look forward to getting back next year to repeat it all again  thank you Spiros Show more
33124805,Stephanie October 2021 We looove the villa! Everything is perfect. The view is breathtaking. The different terrasses are just luxurious and the pool is great.  We loved it and will be coming back!
33124805,Matthew October 2021 We went for a short break as three friends and we couldn’t have found a better place to stay. Comfortable  the views were incredible  Spiros couldn’t have been more helpful and there are several spots nearby that have fantastic food (and wine!).  If you stay  definitely use Mario’s taxi service… he’s absolutely hilarious!
33124805,Aska September 2021 We loved everything about the house. Views  Pool  space! Everything was just great and Spiros is a very friendly and helpful host!
33124805,Raffi September 2021 This house was fantastic. Breathtaking views   lovely simple interiors  and amazing hilltop view in its own private gated grounds. And the pool is stunning . We had a wonderful stay   and our local beach   kouloura was actually the prettiest we saw. Spiros was soo helpful  knowledgeable and kind with anything we needed. Will definitely be coming back . Thankyou for our Corfu holiday .
33124805,Assaf August 2021 Spiros is a great host. Very communicative and helpful. The house was very clean and it is in an excellent location with breathtaking views. The only issue we had was with the layout of the house -two bedrooms in the house and two outside the house. Might be perfect for friends who are sharing but can be tricky with kids. Great experience overall !
33124805,Rory June 2021 I can’t thank Spiros enough for the kind welcome  a meet and greet at the airport then showing us the way to the Villa (a good 40 mins). A welcome basket was awaiting us which was extremely thoughtful given we had landed quite late. From there it was a week to admire the amazing (Santorini-esque) views  clear sea  and indulge in the pool. Spiros frequently checked in to make sure all was well. Fantastic host and a Fantastic place. We will be back.
33124805,Sandy August 2019 The house has traditional touches  blue shutters  stone walls and old doors- clearly an artists house  so stylishly done in a simple eclectic way. The rooms are all very comfortable and spacious and the swimming pool is truly beautiful! The views are amazing! It’s right at the top of the hill so there is an evening breeze which is what you want on Corfu in July! But the house is air conditioned if you need it! The host could not have done more to accommodate us and was extremely helpful in every way! We will be back! Response from Ευάγγελος August 2019 Sandy and her family are great guests. They're very kindly and pleasant people. They are the kind of people you want to host. i Hope to see you next year. Alex.

14378031,Tamara July 2022 All our expectations were exceeded! The Villa was very spacious  very clean and equipped with everything necessary! The location is perfect right next to the supermarket and very close to the beach and some restaurants! The big table on the balcony was great for spending time together with a great view! We also enjoyed the ping pong table and the whirlpool. Agathi was extremely supportive and caring and was always eager to help us quickly!!
14378031,Tarynn July 2022 A beautiful villa that easily accommodated 9 of us. The ground floor was a great space for all the children to enjoy as was the pool. Most of our time was spent on the balconies enjoying amazing views of the sea  Corfu town and Albania. The villa is fully kitted out with everything you will need and we made good use of the bbq too. Having an umbrella to use at the beach was a life saver and the gifts of wine  chocolate and nuts was a pleasant surprise. The villa was spotless and the light cleaning during our stay was perfect. Agathi was a superb host - attentive  quick to respond and made us feel very welcome. It was amazing to have the beach in walking distance to the villa. A truly special place and a holiday to remember.
14378031,Rachel June 2022 The villa  the pool  the location - all surpassed our expectations. Agathi is a wonderful host  she ensured we had everything we needed and is so lovely and helpful. We asked to stay for an extra day due to late flights and she accommodated us. We didn’t want to leave! The photos don’t do this place justice - the pool  the villa and the sea views are stunning. Location couldn’t be better  just a few hundred metres from a quiet and lovely beach. Barbati itself is small but has a good selection of restaurants  beach front bars and shops. If you’re after a chilled out beach holiday this is about as perfect as it gets. We will be back!
14378031,Sofi June 2022 We had a fantastic stay here! Agathi was at the property on arrival and gave us the tour. The villas has everything to offer! The location is perfect! Agathi checked in to see if we required anything during our stay and was super helpful in all of our requests!! Would absolutely recommend and stay here again! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
14378031,Blythe June 2022 Great Villa and ideal location and views! Pool was lovely to have but also very close to the beach. We had everything we needed and had a brill stay.
14378031,Jill September 2021 Agathi went above and beyond to make our stay perfect! We arrived late at night and she was waiting for us at the property to show us around and give us the key - when restaurants were closed she literally brought over groceries and cooked us a delicious meal for 10. The check in and out process couldnt have been easier and she helped us with taxis and recommending restaurants and activities. The property was beautiful and a quick walk to the beach and a local market. It’s a bit of a drive to town so recommend renting a car if you want to explore corfu town.
14378031,Vasilios August 2021 We enjoyed our stay 2 adults and 2 children at the age of 8. Very clean house. Very well equipped kitchen. We loved the pool and played table-tennis. Excellent check-inn support by Mrs. Agathi. A big thanks to all of you VK
14378031,Rishin October 2020 We had a wonderful time here. Agathis recommnedatikns were great especially suggestijg we visit Taverna Glyfa

14378031,Alison August 2020 We had a peaceful and relaxing stay and loved the spacious villa  the pool  the terrace and the beautiful view. Location very convenient for the supermarket  bakery  ATM  beach  boat hire and numerous tavernas.

14378031,Jarrod September 2018 This place is amazing! The perfect location to get a great view of the ocean and surrounds but only a couple of minutes walk to the beach. Check in  the place  great local tips for places to eat and bars. I can’t recommend highly enough!

622363268416396579,Alex August 2022 The villa offers a lot of room. The pool is great  the fruit trees on the site are wonderful and we enjoyed the large outside kitchen. The communication was easy and we were happy  that everything went so smoothly. Finding the way to the villa was a bit challenging at the first attempt because of a famous  however useless navigation system - however if one chooses the right angle (from the west) it’s easy.
622363268416396579,Nikki August 2022 The villa is beautiful and spacious. It’s wonderfully quiet and a great place to stay if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle. You do need a car to get to the nearest shop but it’s only a 10 minute journey. The aircon in the bedrooms worked well and the showers had plenty of hot water. The pool was a good size and you could dive but no shallow end for small children. This didn’t bother us as we were 5 adults. The gardens had lots of fruit growing and we had regular visitors outside behind the fence from the local goats which added to the charm. It was a great place to stay.
622363268416396579,Danny August 2022 We have just returned from Corfu having spent time at the villa.  It’s a beautiful villa in a stunning location with a fantastic swimming pool and amenities.  Perfect for a family of six with four children. A car is an absolute must as the Villa is a 10 minute drive from the main town of gouvia With all its local bars and restaurants. Set in extensive grounds and surrounded by countryside you really feel as if you are away from everything but still a short trip to civilisation. The owner lives next door but he’s completely hidden from view. He was really kind and dropped off fresh fruit and vegetables from his garden for us to enjoy.  We did a day trip to the Aqua land waterpark which was brilliant and took 11 minutes to drive there. It’s a small island and you are very close to the main coast road so going either north or south it’s very simple.  Air-conditioning was superb.  All in all a highly recommended place to stay.

Although at first sight we found it away from the city  the location turned out to be a gorgeous one  with a quiet courtyard with everything you need. The rooms are large  as well as all the space  very generous. The kids too but we were excited about the pool too! Translated from Romanian  Show original
13631666,Vivi October 2022 The location was good near the beach. Magnificient view to the sea. The apartment was comfortable and clean  also it had everything we needed. The host George was helpful and fulfilled all our expectations. We wish to come back sometime!
13631666,Mafalda September 2022 George was really caring and helpful! The apartment has a magnificent view  we enjoyed our time!
13631666,Vi September 2022 Check in and check out was great and George was very flexible! You need two minutes to a small but nice beach with free sunbeds and amazing sunsrises! The apartment has a really nice terrasse + view over the ocean and a nice outdoor shower! The kitchen Utensilien are very rar -it's a bit hard to cook simple meals. You definitely need a car  the next Supermarkt is around 10min away and we would not recommend to walk  the street is busy.  All in all: Price performance was really good :)   Thanks George for giving us your apartment! Best regard
13631666,Mimmy August 2022 George is a wonderfull person  always available for guests. We enjoy so much his place. Like I told you I shared your place around me so don't be surprised if many people come to your place🤩
13631666,Abbey July 2022 The villa is right across the road from a public beach  there are steps directcly across from the villa. If youre looking for something to do i highly suggest the tour to the paxi islan with ionian cruises. the island it visits is beautiful and the on the way back it turns into a party boat on the top deck. You can also jump off the side when they stop at the swiming location.The buses were a bit confusing but george was really helpful and replied really quickly telling us which buses would get us were. The only downside had nothing to do with the villa itself  we found that the buses were very unreliable. They wouldnt stop for us or would be late etc. We had to get a taxi on a couple of occasions which turned out a lot cheaper than we thought so we werent mad about it.
13631666,Cora June 2022 Absolutely amazing host and location!!
13631666,Gaynor May 2022 George’s apartment was very pleasant and good value for money.The view from the terrace was very lovely.

13631666,Sofia August 2021 Simple appartment including all what you need for a short stay  well located   25 minuts south from Corfou town..really nice view  quiet place.
13631666,Ioana August 2021 Amazing location  superb view  great beach nearby  with everything within walking distance. I will come back.
13631666,Alain September 2022 The photo on the site does not represent what we rented. The accommodation despite a beautiful view is noisy with the road below. On the other hand  hot water is produced from a solar panel  and this is not enough to supply all the apartments with hot water  we were forced for 3 days to take cold showers. We alerted Georges from the start and the solution was given by George on the last day with the start of the forced walk of the hot water tank. Translated from French  Show original Response from George October 2022 Sorry for what happened Please know that your situation was an exception. Misunderstanding in our communication on solving your problem  led in the situation you to have not enough hot water whilst at the same time all other Apts had. I understand it brings annoyance. I am also surprised because nobody ever complained about how the rooms are in comparison with the photos (maybe a different photo frame on the wall  or another tablecloth  or another layout on beds in the living room) . The apt is as described by the photos  located on the side of the mountain and downstairs the parking  where every guest parks there  and after that the road. Most guests find it as a big advantage to have imidiate access to the road and especially those who have no car (bus stop 80m away). But for those guests who don't stand any noise  the apt has a/c in each room and double glasses on windows. Show more

13631666,Олег September 2021 Stayed in Corfu in George at Villa Fortuna Panoramic View in the second half of September 2021. Arrived late in the evening and thanks to George for meeting us at the airport and taking us to the place of residence  while on the way to the supermarket to buy groceries. The villa itself is located in the middle of the island  which is very convenient for traveling by car ( rent cars). The view of the Ionian Sea is amazing from the villa  next to a wild beach with free umbrellas and sunbeds. Taverns  mini markets and gift shops are within a walking distance. Buses run to the capital of Kerkyra  if without a car. Driving for 20 minutes. Thank you again  George. I recommend it to everyone. Translated from Russian  Show original

27159281,Bogdan September 2022 Nice stay. Villa with the pool perfect for two families with kids. Good bakery nearby. Is situated far from any beach or city  so I recommend having a car. Adina is very responsive.
27159281,Marcin July 2022 Just great time in wonderfull place  The house is fully equipped  even washing machine / dryer  dishwasher etc.  Located on a busy road  which is both an advantage and a disadvantage - easy to get everywhere by good quality road  The pool is large  sun loungers by the pool  several places to sit in the evening  Very good bakery nearby  a supermarket a bit further  some really good restaurants  Overall - definitely recommendable
27159281,Kristi July 2022 Adina's place is really nice  we enjoyed our stay really much. It was private but easy to find due to instructions. Pool was big and nice to spend evenings there after long day. Everything was perfect :)
27159281,Akelei September 2021 Villa Alba is located a bit in the hinterland of Corfu. However  with the scooter you can reach everything easily. We had great evenings at the villa and had a lot of fun. Adina was a great host and always answered quickly when asked. We can only recommend the stay in the villa!
27159281,Alec August 2021 Had a lovely stay at Vila Alba  such a nice home and location isn’t too bad. We found ourselves going to Liapdes a lot rather than Corfu but definitely well worth it. Would recommend getting a means of transport  nadias bike rental is what we used.
27159281,Valentin August 2021 Villa Alba is an awesome place to stay in Corfu and spend a good time here. Thank you Adina!
27159281,Melissa August 2020 There is not much more you can ask for. For Greece the beds were large and comfortable. The house has everything you could need the pool was the highlight  lazy mornings after breakfast by the pool then jumping in the car for the day’s adventure. It was a treat to stay here. Higher recommend.
27159281,Melissa August 2020 Villa Alba is in a great position  although you will need a car as it is situated a few km outside Liapades  where there are a couple of small supermarkets and plenty of places to eat.  It is a few minutes drive away from beautiful beaches at Liapades  and Paleokastritsa. It’s also ideally placed to explore further afield. Alternatively  the villa provides everything you need to just relax and soak up the sun. The pool is a decent size and is cleaned twice a week. The villa is set back from the main road and we really didn’t notice the traffic.  Adina is a great host  and responded quickly to our questions. We’d happily visit again.
27159281,Carina December 2019 The host canceled this reservation 181 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
27159281,Zhivko September 2019 Adina is amazing host  she provided us great guidance for the island  moreover she responded very quickly to any kind of questions we’ve got. I strongly recommend to visit her! Last but not least property has great location with everything needed nearby.
27159281,Mariana August 2019 We had a great stay at Villa Alba  the entire house and swiming pool were perfect. Very close to most of the beautiful beaches and old town of Corfu. I highly recomend this place. Adina is a very good host. Thank you for the hospitality!
27159281,Rimantas July 2019 Clean  fully equipped villa with nice pool. Easy check in and check out.
27159281,Tomasz June 2019 Wonderful time in wonderful hause
27159281,Eda June 2019 Villa Alba was definitely a highlight of our trip would recommend it to everyone!
27159281,Alexandra September 2018 The house was very welcoming. And very clean- which made us comfortable with a 5 month old baby. We were a bit unlucky with some power shutdowns and without water for over a day - but that was due to a problem in the area so there was nothing that could change. We had to buy dishsoaps and toilet and kitchen paper. Also there is no privacy in the pool area from the road - cars can see u sunbathing. The arrangement of the room is very convenient and provides enough privacy. The hostess was very accommodating and the location is close to Palaiokastritsa which is a very nice area. You definitely need a car Overall I would recommend this villa Thank you for a nice stay
27159281,Eugenia August 2018 Great house centrally located. Great pool and comfortable to hangout during the evening after adventuring the island. I would definitely stay again.
27159281,Joanna August 2018 A lot of space in the house and around it Beautiful swimming pool Clean  equipped with all neccessary stuff house Beautiful views Close to beach ( the small one in Liapades is really great)

27159281,Femke August 2019 Adina is a thoughtful and responsive host. The house is perfect for two families with small children. It is equipped with all the amenities that make life easier. It's kind of like being hosted by a friend. In addition  there was a small inflatable boat  umbrellas  balloons... Everything you can't take to the cabin was available. Thanks to the pool we had entertainment at home while the kids took their nap. Nearby we discovered unusual beaches  an organic wine winemaker  a typical Greek restaurant - so good and friendly. We had a lovely holiday. Thank you so much Adina. Translated from French  Show original
17991264,Elena September 2022 Spiros house is perfectly located if you are looking for a quite and off the tourist route getaway! The house is spacious  well equipped and very clean. Spiros replied quick via what’s app. From this little village you can explore the beautiful northern part of corfu. A car is needed.  We recommend the stay 100%.  Thanks :)!
17991264,Janis September 2022 We very much enjoyed our stay in the apartment. Spiro’s grandparents gave us a very warm welcome. This place was a perfect destination to explore the north of corfu. Next beach  however  is a 20 min car trip away. Wonderful view from the balcony  but beware of mosquitos (you may need some mosquito repellent).
17991264,Hannah August 2022 Very beautiful place. Super clean and well stocked. Plenty of room  the area is peaceful. Perfect place to travel to all the beaches around. Would suggest having a rental car if you stay here. One of our favorite places we stayed on our trip to Europe.
17991264,Maria August 2022 I definitely recommend staying at Villa Areti. The house was very clean and well equipped. The view from the terrace was just wonderful. The location was also ok  it was close to the main attractions of the island. My friends and I spent a great time there.
17991264,Ela August 2022 Beautiful house  owners extremely nice. I recommend😊
17991264,Laura August 2022 The apartment was amazing and his grandmother was really really nice to us :) It was a little bit far from the city center but very calm
17991264,Denisa July 2022 We had an amazing stay at Spiro's villa. The villa is huge and beautiful but you have to walk up the hill to get there so count on it:)
17991264,Mickaël July 2022 thank you very much for this vacations  the house was beautiful  with everything we need  it is located in a little village a little bit away from corfu ans other cities but with very adorable peoples.  Mickaël and Friends.
17991264,Bence July 2022 Verry good  I recommend this airbnb
17991264,Audrius June 2022 Great place to stay if you love great view from a balcony and company of cats :)  Spiros relatives are very helpful and did everything for us to have a great time. The apartment itself is not far from famous and beautiful beaches  so with car you can easily discover North part of Corfu island!
17991264,Snezana September 2021 The villa is located in an old  quiet village.You need to leave the car on the main street  and go up to the house along a rather steep road.So if you have health problems or have small babies  then this option is not for you.Pluses:the villa is big and has so beautiful mountain view beautiful interior.Each room has its own terrace.Not a bad pastry shop  as well as a good small grocery store not far from home. Minses:There are a lot of wasps during the day  and a lot of mosquitoes in the evening.Therefore  there are mosquito nets on the doors and windows.The villa has a very weak Internet.
17991264,Krisztian August 2021 Great house  beautiful panorama and very nice hospitality.
17991264,Viola August 2021 This is a lovely house  spacious and nicely laid out  with lots of different places to sit and relax. Everything you could need is provided  especially in the kitchen  unlike other places we've stayed. It's located at the top of a village filled with flowers and plants and with lovely views across the valley. We received a really warm welcome from Spiros' family and neighbours. If you are happy driving and exploring  and like to be based away from tourists  then from here you can explore all over northern Corfu. Corfu town is also only 30-40 mins easy drive away so we had two days exploring it.
17991264,Rafał August 2021 Great House in great place. Everything was perfect.
17991264,Laurent July 2021 Very nice house in an authentic village. Great hospitality
17991264,Dan July 2021 We felt very comfortable in the villa. Definitely recommended!
17991264,Rodrigo July 2021 Our stay at Spiro's place was amazing. The house is very beautiful  spacious with a great view over the hills. Beautiful spot for the sunset. Spiros is always available and arranging. We highly recommend his place if you are coming to Corfu.
17991264,Hannes June 2021 Absolutely fantastic Area and such a lovely Community/Family around the flat. Hospitable and heartwarming people in a quaint little village. Stunning view over the montains.
17991264,Claire August 2020 We really enjoyed staying in this spacious home in a charming village. Although the walk up to the house was a little steep the view was worth it from the roof terrace. The air conditioning in the 2 upstairs bedrooms was very welcome in the heat of August and we used the fan in the downstairs bedroom. We were close to the lovely beaches of the north and were also able to travel to the beaches in the south from this base.
17991264,Beatrice August 2020 Great house
17991264,Helen August 2020 We very much enjoyed our stay in this lovely villa. It is in a sleepy rustic village close to a shop and bakery. The villagers were very friendly and welcoming and our neighbours seemed truly pleased to have us there. The house is stylish and full of all amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The first floor balcony looks over the village and surrounding hillsides and the views are truly stunning. There is also a pleasant outdoor space to the front and another balcony by the ground floor bedroom. The villa is well situation  about 40 mins from the airport  and it is only a short drive to many interesting local beaches  sights and attractions. Also the owner’s relatives were friendly and helpful  and even presented us with a basket of homegrown tomatoes and vegetables. It should be noted that though the listing says two bathrooms  in fact only one has a bath and shower  the other has just a toilet and sink (though there is a shower fitting). We through that the listing rather gives the impression of two bathrooms and I had asked for confirmation of this before we booked  as we were a party of four adults and two children  and another shower/bathroom was really needed. Also the downstairs bedroom does not have air conditioning  though the host very swiftly provided us with a fan  which made the temperature fine. These points didn’t detract from our happy stay in this lovely villa  and we will remember the place happily. Show more
17991264,Shirlene September 2019 Villa Areti is the perfect place to stay at for family holidays. As soon as you arrive in the little village everyone is very welcoming and the house is simply amazing! The view from the top balcony is incredible and perfect for a morning coffee or an evening wine. The yia yia and papou (Spiro's grandparents) were so lovely and really looked after us and even gifted us with olive oil and fresh vegetables from their garden. Their neighbors were all super lovely too and were happy to have a laugh and chat each time we headed home in the evenings. We would stay here again for sure and would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience a real Corfu village and escape the really touristy spots on the island. Just a few quick reccomendations in where to go on the island; Kasiopi is a lovely little harbour village with nice little beaches nearby  Porto Timoni beach is really worth seeing despite the somewhat difficult walk down (best to wear sneakers)  avoid Sidari as it is crowded and full of tourists (mostly Brits). Thanks again to Spiros and his family for such an unforgettable time in Corfu!
17991264,Alina August 2019 Realy nice place! Lovely host! We had a great time!
17991264,Peggy August 2019 We have a great time in Choreoskopie. It‘s a beautifull village with very kindfull people and a wonderful view. We was there with 7 persons and we love it.
17991264,Gabriela July 2019 Without doubt one of the favorite place we stayed during our time in Greece! The location is fantastic. The rooms was impeccable and very nicely appointed! Very quiet neighborhood which allowed us to sit out on the porch and terrace every evening and morning to enjoy our coffee. All the details noted on the Airbnb reservation description are exact and did not disappoint! Highly recommend this property.
17991264,Kamar April 2019 We had a wonderful time in Spiro's place. The house was perfectly located in to access attractions on all directions and we were able to explore a lot. The village was gorgeous and Spiros' grandma was so lovely- she gave us home-made olives and olive oil. The village is delightful and the views stunning. Very recommended
17991264,Nolan & Amanda September 2018 A stylish villa in a very pretty mountain village  spectacular views over the valley from the main balcony. Great base to explore North Corfu from. Really enjoyed our week.
17991264,Danielle August 2018 We had a wonderful stay in Chorepiskopi with our three children. The house is roomy  clean and has airco and a washing machine. There is a large balcony in the shade with a great view. The house has everything you need. The location is perfect. Away from the tourist area´s but still nearby the beach. The town has a minimarket  a bakery and a good coffee bar. Harry and Areti are very warm and lovely people. Please give them our regards  Spiros. We highly recommend this place and hope to come back.
17991264,Deborah August 2018 We had the most amazing time and loved spending time in the gorgeous villa. The upstairs terrace was even better than on the photos- this had sold it to us when we were choosing where to go. We met locals and felt we saw and experienced a little of the wonderful Greek way of life- which is exactly what we had wanted. Your grand mother was amazing! Thank you!
17991264,Pascal July 2018 Amazing value for price  live among locals  stunning balcony vieuw.
17991264,Pocol June 2018 This place is quiet and with a nice view. We had a wonderful time at Spiros Here are my pluses and minuses in my opinion .  + points : - The house is clean and spacey - Very nice view from the balcony - wifi works well - the house is equipped with nets at windows for mosquitos and has high quality furniture .  - points : - Breakfast was not provided as previously agreed. - No parking place near to the property so we had to hike every day with the kids on a sloping road - The host is not there to give you any advices and his family is not speaking english ( but they are very friendly people)  Over all we had a great time in that neighborhood.

17991264,Pip June 2018 You will find a warm welcome in the small village in the hills. The house is unusual and charming. We enjoyed the view from the balcony and being in the hills away from the bustle of the coastal resorts. The three double rooms were comfortable. There are bug screens which is always helpful to have fresh air and no bugs. There is air con too It is not the place for those with mobility problem  or inability to cope with steps but the narrow village path to the house was part of the style of the area and you are in the hills!
17991264,Vivek May 2018 Beautiful place  bad location. Mr. Spiros himself was not available. His grandparents were there  I felt so bad for them  especially when they do not understand English. Wifi was non functional.
17991264,Marjan May 2018 If you want a quit peacfull place to stay in Corfu. Thuis is the place. It’s central in th north part of Corfu in a small town.
17991264,Ehud October 2017 Very quite  serene  out of the way. Take a couple of books with you...
17991264,Francesco September 2017 The stay at Spiros villa was a pleasant surprise. The village of Choroepiskopi is some ten kilometers from the most important seaside places of the northern part of the island  easily reachable by car or motorbike. The village is inhabited by nice and kind people. The hospitality at the villa  made by Spiros' grandmother  was like going back to the family for vacation: on a couple of occasions they also gave us their garden produce. The house is really beautiful  with a terrace where you can spend pleasant evenings. In other words: Top! Spiros was a very friendly and welcoming guest.
17991264,Monika August 2017 We really enjoyed our holiday in this villa that is located in a classic village of Corfu. The neighbours are very kind and friendly. Don't hesitate to book it.
17991264,Chetan July 2017 It was very hard to leave the house of Spiros! The house was exceptionally clean and spacious with ample supplies. The house was very comfortable to stay in and all of the neighbors were absolutely lovely. Every time we came home it was a delight to greet the neighbors as we came up the hill. Spiros' grandma lives nearby and was helpful and kind  we communicated well with our hearts without her speaking English  or us Greek. I highly recommend staying here if you like to have an experience of getting away from tourists and being in an old time village. But  you must have a vehicle of some kind to stay here as it is centrally located. Thank you Spiros  we had a great time!

17991264,Liliana September 2021 I was left with a bit of a taste of the honesty of the host's information. Reading the previous reviews from the tourists  we asked the host if the shower downstairs is functional  considering there were 7 of us and one of our requirements was to be functional 2% {smart_. The host's response was affirmative but arrived on site  we discovered that the shower downstairs was not working because there was an electric equipment nearby that did not allow water use (electrocute danger). We also asked for information related to the parking for 2 cars  making sure there is parking on the property but arrived there were no reserved parking lots for the property  the parking being done on the village street  where you are lucky to find a free spot  sometimes at 200 properties  while access to the property is on a narrow street  on the steep slope  accessible only by foot ( about 100m from the luggage climbing  the main street where you have access by car ). This information was not provided to us by Spiros   although we have asked them expressly. We love Greece and the honesty of the Gods  but in more than a decade we have been visiting Greece annually  it is the first time we are disappointed by the host  with the franchise of information they provided. În concluzie NU VĂ RECOMAND !!!  I was left with a bitter taste about the honesty of the information provided by the host. Reading the previous reviews of the tourists  I asked the host if the shower on the ground floor is functional  considering that we were 7 people  and one of our conditions was to have 2 bathrooms functional. The host's response was affirmative  but when we arrived on the spot we discovered that the shower on the ground floor was not functional  because there was electrical equipment nearby  which did not allow the use of water (danger of electric shock). We also asked for information about parking for 2 cars  making sure there was parking at the property  but once there were no parking reserved for the property  parking on the village street  where you are lucky to find a free place  sometimes even at 200 owners  given that access to the property is on a narrow street  on a steep slope  accessible only on foot (about 100 m to climb with luggage  opposite the main street where you have access by car). This information was not provided to us by Spiros  although we specifically requested it. We love Greece and the honesty of the Greeks  but within more than a decade of visiting Greece annually  it is the first time we are disappointed with the host  the frankness of the information provided by them. In conclusion  I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU !!! Show more Translated from Romanian  Show original Response from Spiros September 2021 I am very sorry to say that Liliana and her family were the worst guests any Airbnb host can have. Very demanding with no reason  threatening and very dirty.  They were cooking and left a mess in the house. Very rude on the phone and spammy with messages. They even threatened us several times and I immediately contacted the Airbnb support.  Our second shower truly did had a problem and we fixed that. We never claimed to have personal parking space or even a garage (which they asked for). Our description is very clear.  The worst thing is that they exorted us and tried to get discounts on their stay in exchange for not leaving a bad review. Of course we refused and escalated the case to the Airbnb team.  We’ve been hosting guests through Airbnb for years and never had any major complains and problems. Most of our guests leave with a happy smile and some even come back to our villa.  Unfortunately  people like Liliana and her family ruin the hospitality industry. Don’t be like them. Show more

17991264,Christian July 2020 Great and luxurious cottage with amazing views in a typical village  nestled in a friendly countryside neighborhood. We had a great time in Corfu.

17991264,Simona July 2019 Great solution for those who love to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of a typical Greek village. Ideal location for those who want to visit a different beach every day.

17991264,Andrea October 2018 A special house in a Greek village. It makes sense to have a car there. A bakery is within walking distance. The hosts are friendly. We felt very comfortable. Unfortunately  there was no breakfast as described. Translated from German  Show original
17991264,Anna September 2018 We had a very wonderful time in chorepiskopi. The grandparents of spiros welcomed us warmly  and Hari (?) even spoke a little German. Arrival by navsat was hassle-free  in the village you best strictly adhere to the pictures in the check-in instructions  otherwise you have no chance. The house is just as beautiful as in the pictures  very spacious and well equipped. There are a lot of stray cats on the way  but they're not disturbing  but they're not for people with allergies. Small shortcoming - Spiros should pay attention to messages  only three days before the trip we received an initial response so that just a little security was missing. Nevertheless  a highly recommended accommodation for 4 or more people in total. Thanks again to the grandparents!! Translated from German  Show original

The smell in the house is pleasant and fresh. All furniture and kitchen are in excellent condition. I met the owner's mother  a very kind and positive woman. Helped with all requests immediately. Neighbors are fire too. There is a place where you can fry meat outside. There is a place in the mountains and lots of greenery. There are mosquitoes  but each room has screens (and on the doors) + electric fumigators in all rooms  so everything is perfect. The view from the panoramic terrace is divine. Thank you  these vacation days are memorable for a lifetime. Option for those who have a car. Translated from Russian  Show original
17991264,Daria June 2018 Great view. Too bad not all rooms have air conditioning. A bit far from the shops. There are no shops in the village other than a bakery. From the house to any place the serpentine  be ready. It's impossible to get anywhere without a car. Good for those who want to visit all the beaches of Corfu and for those who want a quiet country holiday. Translated from Russian  Show original
17991264,Enya June 2018 Magical place to stay away from tourism. If you love what's special  this is the place to be. Spiros grandparents have and warmly welcomed even though we arrived at midnight. They are wonderful hosts! Communication with Spiro was always very straightforward  even though he was not on site. There is also a breathtaking view from the balcony. Everything in the apartment was very clean and comfortable with a lot of love for detail. You park down the street and then you walk up with your luggage  but it's definitely worth it! If you want to be among the real Greeks  this is the place to be. It was a fantastic time and we would come back again and again! Translated from German  Show original
17991264,Brigitte June 2018 The terrace is a dream and the kitchen excellently equipped. All the amenities were as described  usually even nicer or better than the pictures suggested.

On our first day of arrival we have been given all the usefull information for nice restaurants and sites to visit and also we have been welcomed with a lovely breakfast traditional platter which we and the kinds loved it! George was always available during our stay to give us information and assist us with everything that we needed. I will defiantly recommend to friends and family this lovely place with amazing beach front views.
20528151,Kelly November 2021 Lovely seaside home with an amazing host and hostess!  George and Sophia were wonderful  from first communication  through pick-up (a very kind  nice touch)  check-in  through a little heating issue we had that he solved instantly and to the departure. They were very helpful and friendly.  Although some of the furniture is a bit dated  the home is lovely and suited our needs perfectly.  I would recommend visiting before the end of October  unless you’ll have a car  as most of the town’s restaurants were closed for the season and the bus ran very seldom  but overall  it was a wonderful base to explore the beautiful island of Corfu!
20528151,Karl October 2021 Nice and cosy house near the beach  George and his wife are perfect hosts. The house is well equippet  we found everything we needed.

A good car rental is also round the corner. All in all we can give a recommendation.

20528151,Richard September 2021 The house is lovely and the location is perfect. Ideal place for a relaxing break. Kostas Taverna nextdoor offers good food and friendly service. And Booca Bar on the beach is great for a quiet drink after dinner.
20528151,Amy September 2021 This home from home won't dissappoint. The sea is so close and visible from the front of the house that you could almost spend all your time there. The home is spacious and well equipped. George is on hand as needed for questions and advice. Him and his wife went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We loved the area around the home too  lots of cafes/bars/restaurants to choose from. It has a very relaxed vibe to it. We will be back.
20528151,Zach September 2021 This place is everything we could have dreamed of. Amazing location  incredible hosts  a stones throw from the water. Did we mention the fridge?

20528151,Annabelle October 2020 George's place is really special! Would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking to explore this part of Corfu :)
20528151,Martin October 2020 Had a wonderful stay at Evita Ikia. 10 meters from the beach - you can fall asleep to the sound of gentle waves. The apartment is really lovely with lots of little touches. George was a very gracious host and was able to assist with every query. Wouldn’t hesitate to book again!!
20528151,Linnea September 2020 Lovely house  exactly as described  and George and Sophia are wonderful hosts  and very kind. I had a great time  thank you.
20528151,Honor September 2020 the house was a wonderful place to stay  seconds from the beach. The house is fully equipped and had air conditioning in most rooms!! We had a lovely time and can’t wait to be back  George and his wife were also brilliant and were always there if there were any questions!
20528151,Jill September 2020 Fantastic home well stocked and comfortable beds. George was a great host  sorted out everything we needed quickly and efficiently. Our favourite restaurant was Bacchus just along the beach. The owner set us up a table on the sand and the food was fantastic. A car is probably a good idea to explore the surrounding area.
20528151,Hannah August 2020 We had a fantastic time at Evita’s Ikia  we would have loved to stay for the longer. The place is fantastic with lots of personal touches and the beach proximity is fantastic. George and Sofi are fantastic hosts  we highly recommend staying with them!

20528151,Leah October 2019 George's place was an absolute dream! You can not beat the location  space  and personal touches that really made it a perfect home away from home. We wish we could have stayed longer!
20528151,Jane September 2019 We spent two weeks in George’s house  there were four of us and we had plenty of space  the rooms are large and spacious with air conditioning. The house is in a fabulous position close to the sea and near to lovely restaurants a bakery ( which serves the best cakes and coffee) and a supermarket. All within easy walking distance. The house has a terrace which we used a lot and gives you a view of the sea and beach. We would definitely stay again and use the house as our base. George was a great host  communication was good and nothing was to much trouble.
20528151,Kimboly June 2019 George’s home is amazing  you step out into the water . There is such a vibe in the area with all the restaurants. This was an ideal location for sun   swimming and some exploring . George and Sophia were phenomenal hosts and made our stay exceptional. They really went the extra mile.
20528151,Clare May 2019 Perfect in every way! The house is exactly as shown in the photos. It has all the amenities and was spotless. Some basic essentials were left for us plus a very welcome bottle of wine! Highly recommended.
20528151,Daniel September 2018 George and Sophia are perfect hosts who made us feel very welcome and were extremely flexible with our late arrival and departure.  The house is great - quite traditional in style with every amenity we needed for a two week holiday with a young child. Our son loved the beach toys!  Probably the best thing is the location - Messonghi is a lovely spot  and the house is right by the beach with a lot of restaurants nearby as well as a couple of supermarkets.  Overall  I would highly recommend Evitas Ikia and we would love to come back.
20528151,E. Jane August 2018 What a wonderfully warm welcome from George and Sophia! They were perfect hosts - from their flexibility over check-in and check-out times  to the exceptionally thoughtful thoughtful 'extras' left in the apartment; high-quality locally sourced toiletries ( we loved the kumquat shower gel and body lotion); delicious wine and an exceptionally generously stocked fridge and larder with everything from staples (mineral water  milk  coffee   tea   oil  vinegar etc) to treats (  local wine  bread  cheese and ham for use in the toasted sandwich maker  home-made fig jam  olive spread  Nutella  local honey). We also appreciated the liberal supply of dishwasher tablets  laundry liquid etc - exactly the kind of thing that is a bother to buy on a short-break. Sophia had even laid in brand new rain-ponchos for each of us  in case of bad weather ( we didn't need them!).  The apartment is spotlessly clean  and more than spacious enough for our family of five adults. All-white bed linens and towels were immaculate and of hotel quality  and we loved the fact that it felt like we were staying in a 'real' Greek holiday home . The location of the apartment is unbeatable - 30 seconds from a safe  gradually shelving beach ( we loved the outdoor shower and the 'sea-towels' provided) with a wide array of beach-bars  restaurants as well as three supermarkets and a good bakery.  On the eve of our departure  George and Sophia arrived with souvenirs for each of us - a final - and entirely typical - gesture of hospitality that was greatly appreciated by us. In short  we couldn't recommend their lovely holiday house more highly.  AlAl Show more
20528151,Cj August 2018 Perfect place for a family holiday - and George is a legend. The house is perfectly situated 15 steps from the waves - there are also supermarkets  car rental  boat rental  ATMs  bar and restaurants all within a 5 minute walk. The house has everything you need including an outside shower to rinse off on your way in from the beach. Was a pleasure to meet George and Sophia - you couldn't meet a nicer family and they were the perfect hosts.
20528151,Benjamin July 2018 We had a really great time at George's place. Very helpful  always ready when we needed help! I can only recommend to everyone. Was a pleasant experience :)
20528151,Noreen July 2018 Beautiful house beside the sea. Very spacious with a large living area and kitchen on the first floor  2 bedrooms upstairs and bathroom. On the ground floor is an outdoor seating area. Air conditioning throughout  very nicely decorated and lots of attention to detail throughout. Fully fitted out kitchen  dishwasher and washing machine would highly recommend this house and of course the Hosts George and Sophia
20528151,Jem June 2018 George’s home was lovely in a wonderful area  right on the beach. George was a perfect host  nothing was to much trouble. We will definitely be back.
20528151,Fergus June 2018 Didn’t want our trip to Messonghi to end. 15 steps to the crystal clear sea. Great choice of restaurants . Very hospitable. Two local supermarkets. So much nearby. What’s not to love about Corfu? George and Sophia were great and available if at all needed.
20528151,Blair May 2018 Perfect place for families! Right next to a quiet beach and walkable to several restaurants and two supermarkets. George and Sofia were excellent hosts  meeting us early in the morning for check in  leaving toys for our kids and stocking the kitchen with treats. We had a great time here!
20528151,Sami September 2017 Great 2 floor flat right on the seaside. Additionally  George was an amazing host ensuring we had everything we needed.
20528151,Damien August 2022 More than enjoyed stay! George and his family allowed us to enjoy 100% of our vacation. A very welcoming welcome in a house on the edge of multiple restaurants  and bars. A direct view of the sea and the beach. The rental is close to transport  which allows you to visit Corfu and its surroundings. We only remember the good hosting of George and his family and especially this stay in their home. Translated from French  Show original
20528151,Simon August 2022 Sophia and George were wonderful hosts. We can't thank them enough for the quality of their hospitality and kindness... Their two-story apartment is perfect for a family week at the beach (which is just a few meters away). It is very clean  perfectly equipped and really comfortable. We felt right at home here  and highly recommend this rental. Translated from French  Show original
20528151,Adri August 2019 The house looks like it in the photos. Clean  tidy. It had everything we needed. George is very quick to respond to messages. Even during our stay  it helped immediately when we asked for it. When we arrived  there was enough food and water in the fridge for the next day. She gave us a gift for her kids and to us. We had such a fun time. I would only recommend it. :) Translated from Hungarian  Show original
20528151,Pavel July 2019 Rented a house with a family for a month from June 28 to July 28. Gorgeous house  with all amenities  amazing location by the sea. Hosts George and Sofia  warm people who provided us with an unforgettable vacation experience. They always came to our help  helped with problems and even had a birthday party for our son's birthday. We're glad we met such wonderful and warm people. The house is exactly as pictured  everything is available for a comfortable stay with small children. Everything worked properly  and the hosts prepared pleasant surprises in the form of food and alcohol. All bath accessories have been provided  not just for adults but also for children. We recommend this house to everyone and we will definitely come ourselves. Thank you. Translated from Russian  Show original

George is a responsive host - told where you can have a pleasant stay and have a delicious meal. The house is right by the shore...it is very convenient. Holiday was comfortable and convenient! Thank you for having us!)) Translated from Russian  Show original
20528151,Anastasia July 2018 Wonderful two-storied apartment. Everything is very stylish and beautifully furnished. Air-conditioned bedrooms and living room. Large and comfortable kitchen and bathtub. The house is actually on the beach  so it is very convenient to swim and come home. There are shops and taverns nearby for every taste. Thank you George and Sofia for the nice meeting and gifts. Translated from Russian  Show original
20528151,"Simona July 2018 George's home is steps from the sea  close to numerous markets and a bakery  and there are plenty of restaurants to eat at. Mesoggi is a fairly small town and is in a good location especially if you want to visit the southern part of the island. George is a very helpful Host. He picked us up from the airport and upon our arrival we found a nice breakfast with homemade jam  a bottle of wine for evening aperitivo and towels for the beach. The house is very clean and attention to detail with a very nice little dehors with a shower. Maps and guides of Corfu are available to guests in different languages and in particular a ""super guide"" made by George that caters to every curiosity. We had a great time and upon our departure George and his wife greeted us and gave us a small gift. Translated from Italian  Show original"
50788597,Joe September 2022 What a fabulous stay at Villa Lala. The property is amazing! The pool is pristine and the views from the balcony are incredible. It has everything you could need. Shamil is very helpful and sorted any issues we had right away. We had so much fun at the villa and down at Spiros' bar which is just a stone's throw away. I can't recommend this enough!
50788597,Sam September 2022 Shamil’s place is a lovely villa set in the Poulades region of Corfu. The place is well maintained and the check in was flexible (our flight was delayed).  There’s not much in the immediate vicinity so a car is recommended. Oh the flip side  a car allowed us to really explore the island and there’s a Lidl just 10 minutes drive from the villa.  The pool was lovely and the BBQ was perfect for food with a sunset on the upstairs balcony.  Shamil is a super responsive host and we ended up using a lot of his suggestions (Monastery  Skyview Restaurant  Sunset Restaurant  Kaisers Throne  etc)
50788597,Alison August 2022 We had a great time staying at Shamil’s place. The location is great for lots of attractions - we could get into Corfu town easily and access a range of beaches. The pool was fabulous (and big) and perfect for small children as it has a shallow end. We enjoyed the patio area and the screened in dining area (good for keeping wasps away at mealtimes!). Shamil was really proactive with communication and quick to address any questions and issues  and we appreciated lovely neighbour Katarina on hand to welcome us and answer any questions. All in all  a great stay Response from Shamil September 2022 Thank you for your lovely review  Alison. Glad you had a great time. Welcome back at any time! 🙏🏼👌🏼🌴🎉
50788597,Oscar August 2022 Fantastic stay. Great location. Highly recommend! 100% you need a car for the location but it’s within touching distance of everything! The host is always on hand to help and I think it’s great value for money. Beautiful villa! Response from Shamil September 2022 Thank you for your fantastic review  Oscar. Really glad you had a great time in my villa and in Corfu. Welcome back at any time. 👍🏻🙏🏼🎉
50788597,Michelle August 2022 the villa was perfect for us. personally I would say 100% you need a car. we found the taxis expensive and this limited us to activities we would of liked to of done. the pool area was beautiful. peaceful and tranquil. the villa itself has everything a family needs. we loved the freedom the villa offers a family. the sunset views are amazing too... definitely would highly recommend this villa
50788597,"Klaus July 2022 A charming and wonderful house placed in a quiet and good spot with a stunning view. The pool was very nice and everything inside was clean and ready for a perfect vacation - on top of that there is a special tap for drinking water in the house  saving us the usual ""buying drinking water at the supermarket circus"" :-) Shamil is a fantastic host sending us driving directions and a welcome book before arrival and during the stay he ensures that everything is ok. We would definitely come back if possible. Response from Shamil July 2022 Thank you so much for your great review  Klaus. Welcome back at any time. 👌🏼👍🏻"
50788597,Eric July 2022 Expect a beautiful location with an “all you need villa”! We were more than amazed! Response from Shamil July 2022 Thank you for your stay  Eric and friends. Glad to hear you had a great stay! 👌🏼🙂

50788597,Mark March 2022 Hi - the stay here was just what we needed. Shamil was so helpful - with check in easy and many suggestions to make the stay as easy and relaxing as possible. The villa is spacious and clean and the pool a joy to sit around and cool down in. Gouvia is a great place to stay and easy access to many other places. Thanks  Mark
50788597,Andreas March 2022 Amazing stay at an even more amazing villa  which exceeded our expectations. Despite of our short stay  we left recharged and not wanting to leave :) It was truly fantastic to be able to swim in the heated pool in the middle of March! The estate has a very positive  calming effect which is only enhanced further by the stunning views. Shamil was always just a message away when we had questions and made us feel welcome from the first exchange of emails. Definitely be back for more!
50788597,Diane September 2021 Thank you Shamil - your villa is gorgeous - loved swimming in the pool. Katharina welcomed us and we were very impressed with the provisions you had left for our use. The island is wonderful and everywhere we visited the people were friendly and welcoming. So lovely to have some late September sun - such an enjoyable stay. Thank you again.
50788597,Leigh September 2021 A very well positioned house that is very well equipped. Great pool. Supermarket at the bottom of the hill circa 2km away. Nicely situated close to Gouvia which is a vibrant costal town with a good atmosphere. We highly recommend this villa Response from Shamil September 2021 Thank you for your great review  Leigh and Nicola. Glad you enjoyed your stay. Welcome back at any time.
50788597,Anneliese August 2021 The villa really is fabulous. Lovely sized pool with sunbeds and parasol. Comfy chairs on terrace and balcony for evenings. Location is central in Corfu for exploring both coasts and North and South. Villa is very well equipped with AC in all bedrooms and lounge. You will need a car as it is a couple of miles from Gouvia  but this means it lovely and peaceful and ideal for relaxing. Shamil  Katharina and Dimitri make an excellent team. Communication was superb and we were made to feel very welcome with water  fruit and wine on arrival. Thank you for a great stay and would recommend Response from Shamil September 2021 Thank you so much for your lovely review and glad you and your lovely family had a great stay in my villa. Welcome back next year!
50788597,Arturs August 2021 Amazing and spacious villa with a big pool and great amenities  located fairly close to Corfu  Gouvia and Ipsos (~20-30mn driving distance).  Hosts Shamil & Katharina were amazing  very responsive  the communication prior to our arrival and during our stay was great and they always were eager to help with suggestions or if we had an issue.  Would 100% stay here again!
50788597,Asma July 2021 Wow! Wow! Wow! What a fabulous time I had at Villa La La  Shamil's place! I had an absolutely perfect holiday! It was actually one of the best holidays of my life! The villa is spacious  incredibly beautiful with stunning views. The pool is super clean and inviting and I swam in it every day  perfect in the morning  day and night! The villa is such a haven of tranquility and rest. All the amenities are perfect at the villa and it's such a beautiful and peaceful location. The villa is served by a well- stocked convenience store down the hill and the beach is nearby. I travelled to the Old Town  absolutely beautiful and so atmospheric by the taxi firm which was recommended by Shamil. They always were incredibly polite and extremely friendly with luxurious transport. They picked me up whenever I needed to go somewhere. I thoroughly enjoyed the gorgeous beaches and food  everywhere. Such an amazing and perfect holiday in every way and I have told all my friends about it! Shamil is the perfect host  super organised  friendly and incredibly helpful. I cannot wait to go to Villa La La again!
50788597,Lynn July 2021 A little piece of heaven. I can’t wait to return and have already started planning it.  The most amazing thing is that I was in the pool literally 30 minutes after landing.  The place is so clean and all the little details have been thought of. For example oil in the cupboard  a really nice selection of spices  cleaning products etc.  It’s all been thought about - it’s simple  stylish and really nicely designed.  The outside dining area and outside lounge were particularly popular with my gang.  What is so great is that you feel very safe  particularly in the current climate.  You can hang out at the villa or it is very easy to explore the whole of Corfu Island if that’s what you want to do.  The beaches are perfect some of them filmically beautiful. The hill views make it feel very special and exclusive.  Memories made and memories cherished we will certainly be back. Show more

Special thanks to the owner  Zoi and mrs Lamprini who were so kind and made sure to have everything for our special day! The villa itself is huge  looking even better than the pictures and location is perfect.

37292118,Liv June 2022 Great service and beautiful house!
37292118,Elly May 2022 Everything was incredible  villa looked even better in person. Would recommend hiring cars as it’s nice and secluded with lots of privacy.

36408159,Sarah July 2022 Superb spot is a quiet beautiful part of Corfu island. No need for a car - green Bus stop at the top of the road is simple to use and cheap! The beach is beautiful  the tavernas so friendly and the swimming pool a real bonus! Highly recommend this accommodation albeit on the basic side. Clean and comfortable with excellent location was just perfect for a weeks chilling!
36408159,Phoebe June 2022 Great location  comfortable and safe apartment.

36408159,Holly June 2022 Nissaki is great if you want to stay somewhere chilled and slightly more rural away from all the busy tourist spots. It has a small beach with crystal blue water  free sun loungers and a taverna next door for delicious lunches. The apartment itself was basic but perfect for 1-2 people. The things I liked the most was the balcony area off the bedroom which was nice to lie in bed and have the doors open  the air on was great  a big bathroom  lots of drying racks for wet swimming gear outside  coffee machine and a big fridge to store beverages. It’s also got two desks and strong wifi so you could easily work from home from there!

Only a 5 minute walk to the beach  and close to some supermarkets as well. The owner of the building  Mrs. Mattoula  was very sweet and helped us figure out how to reach Nissaki by bus. I would highly recommend staying here if you want a relaxing stay in Corfu.

36408159,Alex March 2022 good size apartment with lovely balcony and stunning views. A lot of stairs to get to flat and tricky access to parking place  missing basics cleaning and washing up essentials. good stay!
36408159,Lea October 2021 Reliable and uncomplicated communication  whether with the EasyVillas team via Airbnb or also the very  very nice administrator there via smartphone. The apartment is part of a small complex and corresponds to the description. Only the sofa bed has unfortunately been very worn out. The terrace is covered and the view is great! The location is really excellent  the small beach around the corner is a dream! In the supermarket a few meters away you can find everything you need  the owners are very accommodating. I can highly recommend this location  we could relax and unwind super during our stay there.
36408159,Hagen October 2021 just a short walk from the sea with a nice and big balkony. the flat is clean and new. only the kitchen area is a bit small
36408159,Elizabeth August 2021 Nissaki is a small village with everything to hand for your stay. The apartment is comfortable and spacious. Be aware though that it is further from the sea than the description may imply - about 300metres down a rather steep hill. There are quite a lot of steps to reach the apartment and getting suitcases up was quite a job!
36408159,Milena July 2021 Great place and view :-)
36408159,Eric July 2021 The apartment and the environment are very pleasant. Stamatoula was very kind during our stay
36408159,Zeljka May 2021 The apartment is perfect for two persons. It is really clean and you have everything you need. You can sit outside but not in the sun (which is fine in summer).  The location is perfect and feels really peaceful.
36408159,Martin October 2020 Brilliant location for a relaxing time  with only a few steps to beach / bars/ restaurants etc. Would recommend
36408159,Flick August 2020 Nissaki Suite Artemis Apartment really is so special! We are already planning our next trip back. The apartment itself is SO cute! Clean  fresh and modern. The added extra of the pool and bar next door is amazing - all of the staff and fellow holiday makers are so friendly and helpful. We already miss our morning coffees. The balcony at the apartment is so sweet - we enjoyed many mornings eating our breakfast and looking out to the sea. It is so close to the beach (literally a 2 min walk) and I have to say  Nissaki is 100% my fave bay in Corfu - so clean and family friendly too! All in all it was a magical trip. We can’t wait to return! X

36408159,Antoine April 2022 The village is very well placed for visiting by car the nicest places on the north of the island. The view from the balcony is pretty  the apartment is comfortable for them  the managers are kind  you walk down to a very nice beachfront spot. A negative point  you hear a lot from the neighbors above and next door  inside and out. Also  access to the pool is not free  you have to consume at least one drink  the listing is not clear about it. Translated from French  Show original

Magda was really taking care of us and had some perfect advices for restaurants or things to do. The view from the balcony is incredible.
592742077228586649,Bilitis September 2022 Our stay at Magda's place was absolutely lovely. The house is cosy  has a splendid view and is located in a very quiet village. Magda is very helpful and friendly  a perfect host!
592742077228586649,Melissa September 2022 The apartment is in the perfect location  at the top of a beautiful valley with a stunning view. It was equipped with everything we needed and the wifi was mostly suitable for working online. It’s a short drive to some lovely beaches and walking distance to a great local restaurant. We appreciated how quiet the area is  and away from the main tourist strips. Thanks for a great stay!
592742077228586649,Alexandre August 2022 The stay in Magda's flat was perfect! It is very well located if you have a car  the view from the terrace is incredible. There were no negative points  the accommodation is perfect for 3 people. Thanks a lot :)
592742077228586649,Anna July 2022 This apartment was spotlessly clean and attention had been put to every detail. Decor was fresh and airy and the kitchen was very well equipped. There was smartTV with Netflix and Disney+. The host had also left us a bottle of water and melon and some other snacks. The water pressure can be weak but this happens almost everywhere in Corfu. Breathtaking views from the apartment to the mountains and sea. We only stayed for two night but eished we had booked it for longer. There is no big supermarkets nearby  only those touristy ones  so I would recommend doing grocery shopping in Corfu town before driving up to the mountains. Nice place to visit nearby is the Porto Timoni beach.
592742077228586649,Tomasz July 2022 We are very thankful for the friendly hospitality and kindness. Magda and her family are such nice and polite people and really great hosts! Perfect condition  very clean house  all necessities provided  it really feels like it is your own house. Very quiet place  no street noise - only nature. The view is stunning and the morning coffee tastes better on the terrace :) Everything was perfect! We will come back here one day  for sure.
592742077228586649,Loes July 2022 We had a wonderful time at Magda's. The view is even better than on the picture.  Magda is easy to reach  responds quickly and helps with everything you may need.  The house is clean and bright and contains everything you need (also all kitchen supplies which was great). There are two airconditioning units  so it's nice and cool in the house.  You're relatively far from the city center  but easy to reach with a rental car. There are two beautiful beaches closeby.  And finally  Magda has the cutest cats walking around outside. It made our stay even better 😌
592742077228586649,Anja June 2022 Very friendly and helpful landlady. Great view. Newly Furnished. Very clean. We felt very comfortable. Great holiday
592742077228586649,Lucas June 2022 10000% would recommend! This AirBnB absolutely deserves all the praise from the other reviews. The location  the cleanliness  the host  it doesn’t get any better. After an adventurous road to the apartment the first thing you see is the absolutely breathtaking view over the whole valley near Agios Georgios. You will be greeted with a fruit basket and lovely cats my girlfriend won’t get over leaving for some time. The apartment is even tidier than the photos suggest the view from the bedroom and living room is a 10/10. The kitchen has all the basics you need and we can definitely recommend eating breakfast on the balcony. In hindsight we should have stayed for more than two nights because the apartment is absolutely worth it. If you have a rental car you can reach all the surrounding beaches from Agios Georgios  Porto Timoni up to Sidari in no less than 15 minutes. Thank you Magda for taking good care of us! The visit is worth it  especially for cat lovers!!  Lucas and Alina Show more
592742077228586649,"Tania June 2022 Magda's place is like a little piece of heaven away from all the hustle and bustle. It is the perfect location to explore the northern part of the island. The apartment is beautifully decorated and has a super comfortable bed. It is spacious with a separate lounge area  extremely well equipped with new fittings and has a balcony with a gorgeous view of the coast. It is also very peaceful and we loved ""coming home"" after a day out. Magda and her family are very friendly and helpful and are right next door. There are also many friendly and cute cats that come and say hello! I would always stay here again and can highly recommend it. A perfect place!"
592742077228586649,Tania June 2022 In one word : perfect ! Magda is a very kind person. The house was perfect  clean and full equipped. The view is spectacular. Thank you for the hospitality ! I recommend 100%

A short (walk) distance from beautiful towns and beaches. Magda and her husband are very friendly and helpful people. We were surprised with fresh eggs. A place to come back for sure.

It was all very clean  tastefully decorated and the view - fantastic!  There was everything you needed  such as air conditioning  kitchen utensils  a clothesline with brackets as well as towels and bed linen that were changed if necessary. In addition  our stay was sweetened by the tame and cute cats who always welcomed us when we left and came.  Magda and her family are very warm people who are always extremely friendly and helpful. So Magda gave us great restaurant recommendations  found a solution to every problem and even surprised us with fresh eggs and vegetables from her garden.

592742077228586649,Ruhat June 2022 Magda's apartment was the best choice for our approx. 1 week stay in Corfu.  The apartment is located in Dafni  in the north-west Corfu  a bit remote in the mountains. The apartment is newly renovated  clean and very tastefully furnished. The bed is very comfortable. The balcony and terrace invite you to linger all day long. The view of the ocean (even from bed!) is breathtakingly beautiful! Around it all is green. You can hear nothing but birds in the morning. For those looking for peace and quiet  Magda's apartment is 100% recommended! We had a rental car the whole time (I would also recommend this to everyone in Corfu) and could easily explore the whole island from the apartment.  Magda and her family were very warm hosts. Communication was always straightforward and flawless. She was always looking for our well-being and kept asking if we were okay and if we had everything we needed. She was happy to give us tips for excursion destinations  the best beaches on the island  good taverns and Co. When we arrived  water  fruit and snacks were prepared so that we were taken care of after our arrival. She even gave us some super delicious eggs from her own chickens one morning. Her mischievous cats also gave us a lot of joy during our stay.  No question: if again Corfu - then with Magda & her family. ❤️ Show more Translated from German  Show original

16489188,Samuel September 2022 The stay at villa caramel was flawless  the place was beautiful way better than we expected. Gave us great trip ideas and info on surrounding area which turned out to be great recommendations. With awkward flight times too the hosts were extremely accommodating and then on our last day let us have a later check out which helped massively. Will recommend to anyone and everyone going to corfu!
16489188,Alexandra September 2022 What an absolutely beautiful and cosy home to stay in. Big kitchen to cook some family meals  nice couch to watch your Netflix  a very comfortable bed to lay your head  the sheets even smelt amazing! The pool was a great touch to the whole place. Enjoyed our stay so much we didn’t want to leave!
16489188,Danica July 2022 Not only is this a beautifully decorated property with a stunning pool and great central location but the best part was our host Lakis he went out of his way to facilitate us during our whole trip from our cancelled flight & helping our in laws settle in without us to helping us with taxis & also giving tips on our trip. He is genuinely a nice & trustworthy person & went out of his way to make sure we all felt welcome & well looked after with the welcome set up a beautiful bonus. He even came to see us off at the airport. We have stayed in many places & air bnb’s and he was by far the best host we have ever had!!!! Also the people at the local taverna up the road were lovely as well in walking distance for a nice breakfast. Great stay & highly highly recommend. 🙌🏼😊⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️++++ Response from Lakis July 2022 Thank you Danica for your lovely comments! I'm glad you're coming back with the best experiences from Corfu and our villa!!!
16489188,Koal July 2022 Lakis and his villa made our trip. He made himself available to us as soon as we landed to the very end of our trip. His villa was incredible  with a large clean pool and cold AC. It was as advertised for sure. Great location with delicious restaurants in walking distance. Thanks Lakis!
16489188,Jacob June 2022 An amazing place to stay! A stunning house and beautiful pool all topped off with an outstanding host. Lakis went above and beyond and really made us feel at home and relaxed in his property. Would definitely recommend!!
16489188,Louise June 2022 Fantastic host  who can advise on everything Corfu! Love the island and the villa...
16489188,Karen September 2021 we had a great time  the villa was nice and it was great to have a pool. location was in the middle of Corfu so easy to get to different areas. would recommend getting a car. lakis and his wife were really helpful  gave us some recommendations for restaurants and beaches
16489188,Eva September 2021 Lakis was an amazing host! Communication was great  he met us at the airport  helped us with getting around and we got lots of tips about the island! The villa is lovely - great little spot and with the pool we chilled at the house most days:)
16489188,Silviu July 2021 Cozy house  very clean  in a quiet area located in Agios Ioannis( 20 min from Paliokastritsa  15 min from Kerkyra). The owner is a very nice person  very friendly and he helped us with everything we needed. The kitchen is very well equiped. There is a large living room open space with the kitchen on the side  one big room and a smaller one  both of them with double beds. The garden has a swimmingpool  not big  but enough for us  the kids loved it. All in all I reccomend this house  it has also a good price for what it offers.
16489188,Jennifer September 2020 Loved our stay at this beautiful home from home! The hosts were soo helpful and accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble. It’s a great villa  spacious and clean. Nice little touches and soft furnishings! Will definitely stay again.
16489188,Pruthviraj September 2020 I would definitely recommend this place. An added advantage would be that it is in the centre of every tourist attraction in Corfu.
16489188,Kyan September 2020 Lakis and his wife are very nice Host and helpful with many great tips for the island. The villa is located in a silent area of Agios Ioannis and you are central located in Corfu to go tourist points. The interior is nice designed and you can sleep very well. Unfortunately the toilet didn’t work properly (flush) and you couldn’t hang up the shower head. All in all we are a little disappointed of what we got for the money  because we already hat some better Airbnb’s in that price category. Response from Lakis September 2020 kyan thank you very much for your notes. we plan to renovate the bathroom this year and make some other small changes.
16489188,Maya September 2020 We had a lovely stay at Lakis’ property. The villa is in a residential area  about only 15 mns to the center by car (a car is a must). The villa is clean  very comfy  feels like home. Lakis was very helpful for the check in and very responsive whenever we needed anything. I would definitely recommend his villa!
16489188,Stanislava August 2020 Lakis and Adriana are amazing  very polite and nice people. They recommended us wonderful beaches just 10 minutes from the house and gave us many local tips. The house is lovely  much better than a 5 star resort. The pool is sparklingly clean. The garden is gorgeous. The location is superb- 12 minutes from the port and the city centre of Corfu  about 15 minutes from Paleokastritsa  10 minutes from amazing beaches. My family is in love with the place.
16489188,Simon August 2020 A wonderful host  a magnificent house. Lakis and Adriana were so kind from the beginning until inside the airport. We enjoyed the house  the pool  the homemade moussaka made by Adriana and the wine offered by them. We especially enjoyed their company when they invited us for drinks in the city center and had diner with us. We do not usually meet kind people like Adriana and Lakis  we recommend their house and their company. Thank you again guys  and we are waiting for you in Paris whenever you want.
16489188,William August 2020 Excellent villa with a beautiful pool and very helpful hosts. It is very good value and the location is good to explore all areas of the island of Corfu (get a car!) Response from Lakis August 2020 Thanks you very much for the comment !!!
16489188,Josh July 2020 Lakis was a wonderful host  with many great tips about the area. He even provided a birthday cake for my mothers birthday.

16489188,Charalampos August 2021 Mr. Lakis welcomed us very hospitably and even picked us up from the harbor and on the way to the villa roughly told us what is on the way. Mr. Lakis then showed us the villa and explained (where dishes  plates  towels  hair dryer  first aid kit  lights  how to behave in the swimming pool  etc.) are located and how to handle it. Likewise  there was a map of Corfu and Mr. Lakis marked and places to see. I found this very pleasant as I quickly had an overview of the villa and the region. There were also cold/hot drinks and snacks for us.  Villa (inside/outside) very neat and clean.  Also suitable for families with children.  I thank Mr. Lakis and hope to see you again.

49926062,Susanne October 2022 We stayed for three weeks in Anastasia’s home. The location was very convenient for exploring the East and West Coast beaches and not too far from Corfu town. The home was well equipped with kitchen items and bedding and towels. The hostess and host were very attentive to our needs  quick to resolve any issues. We were treated to fresh produce too! Pomegranates were especially delicious!! The only negatives: 1. Noise- road noise is somewhat loud and constant. There are tenants above and below  so there are the everyday type noises with less privacy that goes along with that. 2. The shower has no holder for the wand  so we wove it through the water line hose to make it work. Randomly the water may go from scalding hot to ice cold. This is especially worrisome if anyone staying has children. It certainly could burn tender skin. 3. All the mattresses are very firm. This may not be a negative  since that is personal preference  but perhaps a memory foam topper on at least one bed would make it better. I have a hip injury and side sleeping was not possible on the mattress. Overall  Anastasia and her husband were so kind and attentive to our needs that it made our stay very pleasant and overcame the negatives mentioned above. We were very happy to relax and see so much of Corfu on our first trip there. We hope to return next year. Show more
49926062,Hanqiang August 2022 Wonderful place for a family that has all that is required. Lots of toys and cute kittens to keep little ones entertained. Natasa’s parents who live in the apartment below were incredibly generous and welcoming  providing us with lots of fresh fruit from their garden. 20 minute drive to Corfu town and 15 min drive to closest supermarket. 100% recommended
49926062,Laura August 2022 You will need a car to get around but the apartment is very child friendly and close to Kontosgialos beach. We had a very pleasant and relaxing stay. The internet connection works well but don’t expect the level of speed that is needed for work video calls.
49926062,Oliver July 2022 It is not an apartment. It is home! Someone with a good taste furnished and decorated it  and lived there. Now it is for rent  but with everything still in place  so it is warm and pleasant experience to stay there. It is worth noting that the 1st floor is renting; someone is living on the ground and 2nd floor. However  they cannot be heard  so guests will feel like only ones on the property. On the not so great side  the property is a bit isolated  while next to the road. But  if you plan your grocery shopping carefully  and can tolerate occasional traffic noise (mainly in the morning)  you will have a great time!
49926062,Davide July 2022 Wonderful house and very nice people!!!
49926062,Raitis July 2022 A really lovely place  would recommend for other folks aswell. The grill and garden outside is a really nice touch. We were a 6 people group staying and having 2 bathrooms really helped. There is AC in almost every room  so heat wasn't an issue. Almost all rooms have a private balcony where to chill in the evenings. The only thing is that sometimes the water pressure isn't that big  if everyone is using water simultaneously  but thats a managable thing. The host was really helpful and easy to communicate. Would recomennd.:)
49926062,Dom November 2021 this place is amazing if you are traveling with kids. it's located very central to everything (with a car). lots of space  great kitchen and lots of toys. we'll be back here for our next Corfu visit.
49926062,Marco August 2021 Very nice stay !
49926062,George August 2021 Very nice place and kind host.
49926062,Wioleta July 2021 The apartment is just perfect! Couldn't have been better! Kitchen contains everything one needs. To be honest  everything was as perfect as it seemed online. The hosts provided us with all the information we needed and offered support at all times. They also had excellent restaurant recommendations and informed us about places worth visiting. They made our stay comfortable and memorable.
49926062,David July 2021 This apartment is ideal for a family with small children (we have 4) and is close to some VERY beautiful beaches (Kontogialos was our favourite). Corfu's biggest Water Park (Aqualand) is very close by and Corfu centre is only 20 minutes by car. The kitchen is well-equipped  the private garden is great for BBQ's and as a place for the kids to play safely. Having two bathrooms was great. The off-road parking space made it safe and easy to load and unload our beach stuff. You can't realistically walk to the beach (with children) or supermarket from this location  so having a car (or moped) is necessary. Anastasia was brilliant - very friendly and attentive to the needs of her guests. We had a minor issue with the washing machine which her husband came and fixed very quickly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay - the living room and balconies were great for relaxing. The apartment is on the first floor so is only appropriate for those who are ok with stairs! We would choose this apartment again for sure.
49926062,Karolina July 2021 Anastasia is a great host and the apartment is fantastic. I reccomend this place! Apartment was clean and full of amenities  garden with barbecue was great. Communication with Anastasia was perfect.

Upon our arrival we found some goodies in the fridge that got us well over Sunday (arrival day). Anastasia's parents live on the ground floor of the house. They took really good care of us  included the children  provided us with cucumber  tomato  zucchini  eggplant etc. from their vegetable garden and even occasionally brought us home-cooked Greek specialties to taste. We were also allowed to loot the fruit trees. A family stayed above us with a baby  but they almost didn't notice it. The house stands alone. The nearest neighbors are a few hundred meters away. It is very quiet  only the street traffic can be heard. From there you have a good connection in all directions. The nearest shops are 3 minutes away by car.

There is a tour operator a few doors down  where you can book many different trips  so no need to hire a car. The hosts were so helpful in arranging our airport transfer and meeting us on arrival too. We arrived in the evening and very much appreciated the snacks and wine and water in the fridge! The house and gardens are superb! So spacious and well equipped. The pool and the view of the sea is lovely  even better than the pictures. We will definitely return!

27669809,Lina June 2022 The house is really beautiful with a big garden and view at the sea. Angelique is very accomodating and communication was easy. We already arrived at 10 am and as the cleaner was still in the house Angelique and her husband offered as a breakfast in a cafe nearby  thank you so much! Our stay was really lovely. Maybe one thing to add which is not very clear in the description of the house: Angelique and her husband are living in the upper part  you rent the buttom part.
27669809,Vikki May 2022 Villa Mellina is like a little piece of paradise. Everything was perfect. The beauty of the outside spaces and the quality of the inside spaces are exceptional  and both very spacious. The hosts Angelique and Spiros are lovely people and very kind. We loved spending time in and around the splendid private pool area   which has comfy loungers as well as table and upright chairs and even has the very thoughtful addition of a fridge. Outstanding views can be admired from most areas of the property. The whole place is actually much better than the pictures show. A multitude of restaurants and tavernas in easy walking distance make the need for a car unnecessary. Highly recommend and would love to revisit.
27669809,Jo May 2022 Villa Melina is wonderful! We came for a relaxed girly holiday and it fit our need perfectly. Not palatial or fussy  but comfortable and spacious (so spacious!). There are multiple areas  indoor and outdoor  for dining  relaxing  and basking in the sunshine at all times of the day.  The kitchen is adequate  but there are so many great local food options within a short walk  we didn’t need to cook at all. The bedrooms and en-suites showers are great; the beds themselves  although comfortable  are on the harder side.  The pool overlooking the sea is just beautiful! It’s well kept (tended to daily)  and even has a fridge to keep drinks cold.  The hosts were very helpful  ensured we had everything we needed  and live above so can be on hand if needed.  We’d happily come again! Show more

The pool is lovely and clean and there are good quality loungers around it. There is also some much needed shelter available. There is even a fridge for your cold beers! Absolutely no doubt the best Airbnb we have hired.

We had the best time in Corfu thanks to Angelique and her husband  always available if we needed something and very helpful. Everything you need is in the villa  to relax or work. Plenty of great options to go out for dinner in the same street. We do definitely recommend staying at Villa Melina!
27669809,Martina September 2021 We had a wonderful stay. Great hosts  super house  wonderful environment. Thanks!
27669809,James September 2021 We stayed for 2 weeks  with 2 young children (2 and 6) and we absolutely loved it. The villa was amazing inside  and outside the seating area was amazing. The garden was probably too big for us if anything but that's certainly not a negative. The pool was lovely. The access to the rocks and sea for swimming daily was also amazing. The pictures do not do it justice!!  Within a couple of minute walk there are restaurants  bars  supermarkets and within a 5 minute walk (10-15 if you have a 2 year old) you have sandy beaches with beautiful clear water.  The communication on the run up to the trip and during was outstanding. We were going to hire a car for the full duration of the holiday and after speaking with Angelique  she convinced us not to do this and if we wanted to hire a car we could do it on a daily basis and it would be much cheaper. We ended up not renting a car at all as we were so happy with the local area and what it had to offer for us. So before we even arrived  Angelique saved us a fortune. She even arranged the Taxi to pick us up from the airport on arrival and take us to the villa.  The communication during the stay was great  Angelique checked in every so often via message to see if we required anything. Angelique and her partner Spiros popped down a few times to check everything was ok  which it always was  but apart from that you would not know they were there.  Cant rate the villa or the host highly enough. Will definitely be coming back here next year!!! Show more
27669809,Ian August 2021 This is a magical place  beautiful house with spacious grounds  pool and private access to the sea.  Angelique was a fantastic host and very accommodating with our arrival and departure. Visitors will not be disappointed with this villa - simply amazing!!!
27669809,Emma Asunción August 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Villa Melina. Angelique and Spiros are wonderful hosts: very friendly  and always helpful. The apartment is awesome  has a great view  wonderful pool  and a privileged access to the sea. We looking forward to coming back!
27669809,Karolina August 2021 We were a group of 4 and a child (2 years) and we stayed for 1 week. First we were confused as there is no „address“ (street name and number) but it seems to be normal in this area. We had a wonderful stay and enjoyed every single moment in this beautiful house with a breathtaking view! Huge Living room  bedrooms with AC  shady terrace  sunny garden and pool make your stay more than comfy. Angelique and her family are very warm hearted people. They were lovely and perfect hosts to us. The little private car rental office in the front part of the house you wont notice during your stay. We definitely want to come back! Thank you Angelique !
27669809,Fiona July 2021 Loved it amazing we will return I hope Response from Angelique August 2021 I enjoyed very much the presence of the fiona family But the good times also have an end. Maybe see you soon. Translated  Show original
27669809,Toby September 2020 This place is so much nicer than the pictures. The garden is beautiful and the pool overlooks the sea. It couldn't have been nicer. Angelique very kindly allowed us to stay during the day on our departure day  which was excellent  as our flight was late in the evening. The area has some lovely restaurants but is a little under-developed. But you can easily get to Paxos on a trip or drive to Corfu Old Town if you have a car. Spiros' father's figs were delicious! We had a lovely week. Response from Angelique September 2020 Thank you Toby we were delighted to host you and maybe see you soon Translated  Show original
27669809,Peter September 2020 Villa Melina is a wonderful place to stay. The setting is amazing  right on the edge of the sea with a lovely pool too. The apartment is a great size for 4 people with spacious bedrooms and very nicely appointed.  The lounge and outside dining areas are perfect - especially the outside one with the lovely sea view.  The local area is great with lots of taverna options and a couple of supermarkets a 5 minute walk away.  Our children had such a great time in and out of the pool and the sea - we miss being there!  Angelique and Spyros are great hosts and do whatever they can to help you. Thank you both!  We would highly recommend Villa Melina for anyone wanting a relaxing holiday in a stunning setting.

27669809,Stephanie July 2020 Fantastic location! Uninterrupted sea view  private garden and beautiful pool. Perfect for a family vacation. Very clean and spacious apartment with two en suite large bedrooms. Huge garden with terrace in shadow and in the sun depending what you prefer. Perfect pool location with even separate steps into the sea. Walking distance to two beautiful beaches and all local amenities and with rental car you can explore this beautiful part of the island (e.g. 15min car ride to opposite side of island for outstanding fish tavernas). The hosts are amazing - they are very hospitable and full of great local recommendations. They live in the apartment above but are very discreet and lovely. We definitely would recommend this place over and over again! Response from Angelique July 2020 Thank you Stephanie  we were very happy to host you  it was a pleasure Translated  Show original
27669809,Rafal September 2019 Breath taking place   so amazing views in the morning and at the night... just step away from the clear sea where you can enjoy your time almost on your own ...

27669809,Vladimír September 2018 We had a wonderful holidays.
27669809,Thomas September 2018 Angelique and Spiros are wonderful hoasts: very friendly  attentive and always helpful. We had a great stay at their apartment  since they live in the same building  communication was always easy. It is very tastefully furnished  everything is clean  bright and new. The apartment is in the middle of a small village that goes along the coast. It has two bedrooms   is big and has a wonderful terrasse and garden facing the sea. You can go there for a quick swim in the morning  if you want to go to the beach  it is a ten minute walk. The beaches nearby are all sandy and very pleasant. We can strongly recommand a stay at Angeliques !
27669809,Zsuzsa August 2018 Unique and beautiful place. Great location right on the sea. Clean and comfortable house  definitely we come back.

27669809,Eva October 2021 Perfect very large apartment for people who want to have everything: on the one hand relaxation in their own area with pool  sunsets  sea - but also the infrastructure of shops  restaurants and beach within walking distance. The location was perfect for us with direct access to the sea. Although we did not swim between the rocks  we also went to the (hidden) sandy beach 2 km away  but the lake was still ubiquitous. Villa Melina is located directly at the entrance to the village  the shore road is little busy. The large garden (private use) is definitely a dream for many families. We've been out and about a lot. Even though the destinations in the north are quite far away  there is a lot to see on the way  the tours were therefore all very nice and worthwhile. Be sure to visit Lefkimi Bridge  Petritis and the monastery in Panagia. But even without a car  you will surely get your money's worth here. Restaurants: El Cielo  Malibu and fish at Limnopoula in Petritis Translated from German  Show original
27669809,Sylvie July 2020 Great stay at Villa Mélina where everything is re-created for you to have a dream stay: if our experience of Corfu was so unforgettable it's also a lot thanks to our stay at Angélique and Spyros who made Villa Mélina a peaceful place to rest: I would highly recommend it!

50566760,Giannis December 2022 Great place right in the midle of the city
50566760,Susan September 2022 Marie's centrally located apartment is neat and clean. It is in a perfect location for cafes for morning breakfast  shopping in the old town and sight seeing. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do and see.
50566760,Carlotta August 2022 We had an amazing stay at Maria’s Airbnb. The location was perfect and it was really in the heart of Korfu. Anyway it wasn‘t loud in the night. Maria is very kind and the check in was easy. We arrived late in the evening and Maria gave us a bottle of water for the night. In General it was clean and we had everything we needed only the bathroom wasn’t that clean and there was a bikini from the guests before left. Nevertheless it was a nice Appartement.
50566760,Laura July 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at Marie’s apartment. The communication was great  the host responded within minutes every time we sent a message. Everything was clean and tidy  it’s an old building but the apartment is modern and nicely decorated. The location honestly couldn’t be better  it’s situated right by the alleys with the best atmosphered restaurants. Recommend! Ps. The neighboring dog can be a little scary!
50566760,Lucy July 2022 Really great location and great value for money. Had a lovely warm welcome and the apartment was very cute! Response from Marie August 2022 Τhank you so much Lucy for your kind words. You are great guest and happy to recommend!
50566760,Alfie July 2022 A very nice flat. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Marie is very responsive  communication was great. An excellent place from which to explore Corfu town. Response from Marie July 2022 Thank you very much for your kind words. You are excellent guests and I will be very happy to see you again.
50566760,Vaida June 2022 Stayed at Marie’s place in the old town of Corfu and loved it! The place is small  simple but clean and cozy. The location couldn’t be better! The host was very friendly and extremely helpful. Me and my friend were very happy with the choice! Thank you  Marie  for everything!
50566760,Isobel June 2022 Great location right in the heart of the Corfu. Very clean and tidy with everything you could need. Marie is an excellent host who responded very quickly. She even let us check in early when we arrived earlier than expected. Near a bus stop and the town centre and 10 mins from the beach. Highly recommend
50566760,Isabelle June 2022 Marie waited us when arrive to show us the flat and she gave us welcome gifts. She was nice et very reactive.
50566760,Olivia April 2022 It's always unpleasant to criticise but it's important to say : we are sorry to admit that our trip was a bit disappointing  the bed was painful  the kitchen was impossible to practice  the bathroom was too basic and small... All of this would have been OK for a smaller price. The good point is the location.
50566760,Jonathan January 2022 Marie was lovely and check-in was super easy. Amazing location with walking distance to everything you need. Thanks Marie!
50566760,Maria December 2021 A beautiful place to stay in the heart of the city . The host was really helpful and polite and the communication was great . I would definitely choose it again for my next trip to Corfu!
50566760,Melany September 2021 We had a great time at Marie’s for a couple of days! She faces us some recommendations while we were visiting Corfu Town.
50566760,Valeria September 2021 Lovely stay in Corfù! Marie is a kind host. Apartment very close to the city center.
50566760,Sandra September 2021 Pro: - Marie is very nice and replies fast when being contacted - the apartment is right in the center of the city  perfect location  very close to the beach (10 min by foot) - supermarkets and restaurants are very close - walking distance to airport  Con: - front door is always open - no AC - water damage/ mold in bathroom - kitchen is not suitable to cook a legit meal  not enough plates and rusty appliances  Price \ value is not given  good place if you are just crashing in the apartment after partying  nothing for long term
50566760,Camille August 2021 Very nice place within the center of the old town !
50566760,Hugo August 2021 We had a very good stay in Marie's apartment. The location is really good  in the center and near to the restaurants of the town. Marie is very welcoming (despite our midnight arrival).
50566760,Antonio August 2021 I don’t like bad reviews  it can be  I just had a wrong night  Maybe better to get things like feedbacks. Unfortunately the fan was not enough as remedy for refresh the air and we could barely sleep because it was terribly hot. The position is perfect but the building you will stay is very old without any sign of maintenance  what disturbed us particularly  where the not clean fornitures (mostly the fan was really full of dust) and the carpets old and smelly  full of spots. The pictures are taken from angles and lights which let show the flat much nicer as it really is and the kitchen you can’t use at all  full of rust. We couldn’t enjoy our stay  even for only one night and even for full season the price was not for a cheap bad flat  so price/quality it didn’t go well together  maybe just for the position.  As said we don’t want to be bad we just want to give improvements feedback  because the other reviews showed us something we couldn’t find there.  About the host   as I said  was very gentle and calm so it shouldn’t be taken personally  with a bit more attention  mostly for the hot temperatures remedies  the stay could be at least acceptable.  We are anyway always thankful anytime we stay at someone else place.  We wish all good because in life everybody can get better 🙏👍🏻 Show more

1922203,Romano October 2022 The stay at the cottage was dreamlike. Konstantinos welcomed us personally and showed us everything we needed. He was also available for us at any time  even when we locked ourselves out once. The cottage is very clean and has everything you need. The pool is huge and clean. We will gladly come back and highly recommend this accommodation!
1922203,Tal October 2022 Wonderful Villa with great pool and loads of amenities
1922203,Marina September 2022 Konstantinos was extremely helpful and responsive throughout our whole stay. The villa was wonderful  we really switched off and had a wonderful vacation
1922203,Rosemary September 2022 We had a wonderful stay here! The location was great  quiet and very private but still close to town. Well equipped kitchen if you want to cook.
1922203,Petia August 2022 Lovely house that is nicely renovated with love and attention to detail. It’s set in a completely fenced plot offering a lot of privacy. At the same time  only minutes away from the city centre. Good-sized swimming pool. Beds are comfortable. The only thing that could make things even better is to have tables in the rooms in case one needs to work. Konstantinos is a great host  very responsive and accommodating our requests.
1922203,Laura July 2022 As a family of 3  we had a fantastic stay here.  The pool is perfect and made our holiday  great size and warm all day through to the evening.  Konstantinos was always quick to reply to messages. He offered advise on the best beaches and restaurants. We had a minor issue while we were there  Konstantinos had called a plumber out and had it fixed within hours.  We rented a car to get around  it’s a quick drive into Corfu town with many nice restaurants. And just a small drive to many beautiful beaches.  Would love to return!
1922203,David October 2021 Our stay at Villa Nautilus was top class  an absolutely fantastic stay. The villa was lovely  recently renovated and very stylish  felt way more expensive than it was  it was well laid out  lovely furnishings  bathroom and everything. Konstantinos was an amazing host  went over and above to make sure we were comfortable  answered every message on WhatsApp within minutes and had recommendations etc for our stay. I would recommend this as the place to go for anyone  my best Airbnb stay to date. Thanks Konstantinos!!
1922203,Etienne October 2021 We stayed 5 days at Villa Nautilus. We are pleased to confirm that we made a very good choice. The villa is located 10 minutes far from Corfu centre  in a very quiet area. Although in October  we enjoyed the large swimming pool; the Villa has been recently renovated with all the comfort needed  very convenient and clean; We appreciated the commodities available (soap and shampoo  drink bottles water  coffee  some food for the first breakfast …). The owner stays discrete but available on demand and very reactive; we enjoyed the check In and check out flexibilities; thanks Konstantinos for the advices and tips.
1922203,Sean October 2021 We had a wonderful time at Nautilus Villa and it was very hard to leave.  Konstantinos was very friendly and communicative  let us check out late and came to say goodbye.  The villa and grounds are beautiful  really conveniently located and very clean. Konstantinos left food and other necessities for us so we didn't need to go straight out. Also there's a great taverna a short walk down the road at the roundabout.  Overall I couldn't recommend Villa Nautilus highly enough. 10/10  P.S. We were graced with several cats during our stay. They were very friendly  no trouble at all.
1922203,Thomas September 2021 We had a wonderful at Konstantinos' place - it really couldn't have been any better. The house is in a great location - close to airport and Corfu Town  but also to anywhere else you'd want to reach on the island. There's a cheap  but very good local restaurant 2 mins drive away and lots of supermarkets. What makes this place really special though is the pool and the design of the house - lots of thoughtful details as well  e.g. extension leads  food on arrival  etc. and Konstantinos is really the best host I've ever had on AirBnb - always available for help or tips on WhatsApp and incredibly accomodating. We had a late flight and he let us check out at 16:30 on the day of our departure without charging us extra ... we've stayed in many AirBnb  but this is probably the best so far.
1922203,"Michael September 2021 We have just spent a wonderful week at ""Villa Nautilus"". Ideal for 4 people (family or friends) if you want to completely switch off and relax. Everything is modern  comfortable and in top condition! With the great pool and the beautiful veranda with barbecue facilities  you won't get bored. Many top tips are easily accessible with a rental car and there are good to very good restaurants in the area. The ""Ambelonas"" winery is particularly recommended. Excursion destination (to those otherwise mentioned in the travel guide)  the olive mill ""The Governor's"" with an interesting and funny guided tour by George the youngest son of the dynasty. You don't even know how to find the right words about the host Konstantinos and his nice wife. Even before arrival  super nice and personable  helpful  friendly and competent on site. All in all  probably our best accommodation in this category so far and that is saying something ... We would come back anytime! With the best memories Michael and Markus"
1922203,Henry July 2021 A really lovely place. Everything you could need  great pool. Peaceful location from which you can drive to lots of the island relatively quickly as it is central. One review complained about the cats… they really aren’t a problem - if you ignore them they get the message! Konstantinos and his wife were great.Thank you so much!
1922203,Daniela July 2021 We are a couple and spent a week here  at the end of June and we enjoyed a lot the house  the pool and the garden! The hosts were absolutely nice and helpful! The location  though not near the sea  makes everything accessible  functioning as a base center  in case you would like to see many beaches  to catch as much as possible out of Corfu Island (You would need a vehicle). We enjoyed especially the privacy of the garden and the fully equipped house. And also  the beautiful design of the house  where you’ll find lots of thoughtful touches! It is a country side house so you’ll encounter/hear animals and chickens and birds  which we loved! We would definitely recommend Konstantinos place!
1922203,"Lucas October 2020 Konstantinos is a lovely host and really goes out of his way to make you as comfortable as possible. The villa is located away from any major areas and is a pain to map to  however Konstantinos does provide directions to and from the airport. The pool is huge and the villa has all the amenities you need. The area is very rural  lots of bugs. Wild cats perch outside the door and will try to get inside whenever they can which really detracted from the feeling that it was ""our private home"" for the 5 days we stayed. But  if you're an animal lover and don't mind cats watching you all the time then you won't have any problems."
1922203,David September 2020 Amazing apartment with own pool. The host was brilliant and he looked after us from the moment we arrived (nice chilled bottle of vino in the fridge) til the very end. Ideal location for those wanting to just chill and relax
1922203,Leigh September 2020 Wonderful place  great location
1922203,Joshua September 2020 Great place for a couple looking to hide away in the sun. Konstantinos was very welcoming and always available to answer questions. The pool was clean and very refreshing. The place was a short drive from the airport and Corfu town.  Overall we had a great relaxing time which was exactly what we were looking for
1922203,Avraam Gerasimos July 2020 Everything was perfect. A place to relax and enjoy. Konstantinos was very helpful and ready to assist with anything. I will suggest to everyone who want to have a great stay at Corfu.
1922203,Mia August 2019 We had a great vacation in Villa Nautilus  Konstantinos was super welcoming and provided all info we needed and we really felt at home. The location is super convenient for exploring the island. Large pool and garden are amazing. We highly recommend it! :)
1922203,Miguel August 2019 Konstantinos was the BEST host. He went above and beyond all expectations to make the best of our stay. I wish all the host were as great as him. The house is great. We loved the pool!
1922203,Niklas July 2019 We can highly recommend this house. We travelled as a couple but the house would work excellent for a family with two kids. The house was fully equiped and very clean. The pool was great and big. Konstantinos is a great host and very welcoming and helpful in every way!
1922203,Tim July 2019 We chose Villa Nautilus for our holiday because of the authentic Greek accommodation  secluded location and excellent reviews - we weren’t disappointed. We wanted a quiet and relaxing break and Villa Nautilus certainly delivered. Only a 10 minute drive from the airport (not on the flight path) and close enough to Corfu town centre if you feel the need to enjoy the local hospitality. Although secluded we were only a 2 min drive (10 min walk) to the nearest supermarket and taverna and a short drive to the nearest beach. The accommodation is lovely  traditional  comfortable and reflects exactly what you see on the website. The pool is amazing  perfect temperature and really is as big as it looks in the photo’s! Our holiday was awesome and the whole experience made even better due to the care and attention of a friendly host (Konstantinos) who was always available if and when required. We had excellent communication before  during and also after our stay. For us the perfect holiday and already planning next year’s visit.
1922203,David May 2019 What a wonderful and attentive host Konstantino is! Perfect communication and extremely helpful. Beautiful  very clean and cosy villa with a fantastic garden and swimming pool. Very convenient location to explore the whole island. Thank you to make this trip such a wonderful experience!
1922203,Sofia August 2018 Our stay at the villa Nautilus was very good  Konstantinos is a very good host  helpful  very kind and available ! The villa is very good and the pool too ! We will come back !
1922203,Michael June 2018 We had a very nice stay with our little daughter at Konstantinos' house in Corfu. When we arrived he already brought us some food and drinks for the first night  so that we just could start relaxig after our journey. We found everything we needed in the house und if we had questions Konstantinos was always available. The house was very nicely decorated and the pool is great. Overall  we could really recommend to stay here.
1922203,David June 2018 Konstantinos' house is at the image of Corfu's lifestyle  simple and quiet easy to live in. It's a real pleasure. The house is on all aspects very clean  everything is at your disposal and there is all you'll need to stay there  including a great dvd selection for the late evening. Konstantinos is always answering quickly in case you need anything and whatever you need he will try his best to help you out. In perspective to my previous trips i would definitely put it as a Super Host it is a great experience and a great service here!
1922203,Nadia May 2018 We spent several days in this amazing villa where everything is perfectly organized in such a way that you could enjoy your holiday. Swimming pool  nice outdoor seating and birds singing - all of that helped us to relax under Corfu sun.  Konstantinos is a friendly and welcoming host  responsive and helpful during our stay. He was also very flexible in check in and check out times  which was very kind of him.  Overall  we had a great stay there and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a villa on Corfu.
1922203,Grace September 2017 The villa is stunning and Konstantinos is the perfect host. There are buses both to Corfu town  to aqualand and to the west side of the island that stop just a few minutes walk away at the bottom of the hill and there are supermarkets in walking distance. We couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay from either the villa or Konstantinos  we had a lovely week.
1922203,Alexandra August 2017 Our 1 week vacation at Villa Nautilus was absolutely fantastic and i felt in love with the place. The villa is amazing  if you are looking for peace and privacy with Greek accents and a fabulous pool with beautiful big garden  you must contact Konstantinos asap! Me and my husband had a lovely time at the villa  the place is exactly like in the pictures  15 min away with the car to Corfu Town and easy to get to at all the known beaches on the island. I cannot thank Konstantinos enough for being an amazing host  with giving us great advises on what to do around the island. Many thanks again for the little treats in the kitchen and taking so good care of us and having such an easy communication. We are looking forward to returning to Villa Nautilus soon!
1922203,Cecile August 2017 Constantinos was really helpful during our stay and his kindness is remarkable We really enjoy staying in villa nautilus  the swimming pool was really nice during hit days and we could easily discover Corfou from this house
1922203,Jean - Francois June 2016 The house is perfect  very well equiped  very pleasant and warm swimming pool. Konstantinos is very nice and available  he was flexible for our early checkin  a nice welcome package with coffee and pastries waited us. Really a 5 stars reception. We will definitely return to Corfou  and it will be in this house.

When we arrived there were sandwiches  toppings  wine  beer  milk  orange juice  cereals etc. ready for us  really very thoughtful! We enjoyed the house very much and (the beds by) the pool. We had a rental car with which we explored the area. You are indeed quickly in Corfu city and the airport is very close. Konstantinos is very friendly  responds quickly to messages  is on time and also during our stay he was open to any question. Translated from Dutch  Show original
1922203,Antoine July 2017 Well located house 10 min from Corfu old town  near Aqualand. Lovely pool. Konstantinos is extremely helpful and attentive. In the improvement points  finishes to be completed (equipment in particular) and a lot of mosquitoes and wasps (but this may be the case throughout the island). Translated from French  Show original
1922203,René-Simon August 2016 A charming comfortable house  a swimming pool... dream  a row of olive trees watch over the tranquility of the garden  a cheerful host  helpful for pure kindness - see you next year  Konstantinos! Isabelle and René Translated from French  Show original

6633057,Sneha May 2022 We had a wonderful experience staying at this villa. It had all the facilities we needed as a group of four with a young toddler. The kitchen is the best equipped I've ever come across on AirBnb. The house  yard and pool are huge meaning it's great to relax in on those days when you don't want to go out. If travelling with a toddler/young child  please note the house is not baby proofed and the pool doesn't have a gate so you will need to be vigilant! As others have said  you'll need a car to get around but there is so much to do 10-20 min drive away. Cleaning service is top notch - the pool was cleaned regularly during our stay  and housekeeping service was available once every three days. Response from Sofronios May 2022 Dear Sneha. I appreciate your positive feedback about our property and thanks very much for your time to review. We do take pride in catering to our guests' needs the best way we can.

6633057,Jo October 2021 Villa Cleopatra was perfect for us big enough for 8 people with a massive pool. Everything we needed was there for our use. The villa is a 7 minute drive to the nearest supermarket & Gouvia with lots of lovely resturants & the beach with a few shops. It is 15 minutes from Corfu town We visited many parts of Corfu and it is a very beautiful country. Car hire is essential. Wifi & Netflix was a bonus for when the rain came. I would highly recommend Villa Cleopatra. Beware of the Mosquitoes 🦟 Response from Sofronios October 2021 Dear Jo.

6633057,Eugene July 2021 Villa cleopatra - is a villa in the middle of the island  we rent it in July 2021 for 3 weeks. Villa with it's own super big pool that is really comfortable then you stay at villa and have a rest across the garden. The island has a ton of activities and crystal beaches. You definitely need a car   but location of villa is a perfect  you are about 20-30 min to any crystal famous beaches  Corfy town ets. The property was gorgeous  well blended into surrounding olive trees  pomegranate trees  pears and other fruit trees. Flora and fauna was absolutely abundant. Well equipped kitchen with all facilities  open terrace for eating. Fantastic BBQ area  chilling area  superb pool zone  even table Tennis. Cleaning was invisible for us   but at a high level. There is no complaints. Definitely will get back there. Response from Sofronios July 2021 Dear Eugene.

6633057,Caroline October 2020 This is a beautiful villa in a rural location but it is still well placed for access to numerous beaches and Corfu Town. A car or other transport is essential but that will also help you to explore this wonderful island. Sofronios is very helpful if problems need addressing. In damp weather I would agree with another review re the lower floor bedroom  it is unusable. Luckily we didn’t need to use it.
6633057,Alistair June 2018 Very nice villa with a very nice living space. Host was professional and responsive to minor issues. Location is good although a car is essential. Pool is big and great!
6633057,Andrea May 2018 Everything is Perfect  can’t complain Response from Sofronios May 2018 Dear Andrea  Hello from Eos.

6633057,Orfej September 2017 This house is bad value for money. It should accommodate maximum six persons. The room in a cellar has the looks and the smell of moist.  There are no mosquito nets on major doors  windows.  The house is maintaned badly. Response from Sofronios September 2017 Dear Orfej   Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at Villa Cleopatra. It is only through feedback such as yours  that we are able to maintain and indeed  where necessary  improve upon the service that we provide to our valuable guests. It was disappointing to read of your experiences and mainly your comments concerning property's value  which we only accepted as a personal criticism and nothing further. Whilst an apology for the reported cleaning issues will regrettably not alter the outcome of your experience on this matter  I do extend it with all sincerity. I certainly emphasize regarding the points you mention in your review. This serious issue has already been acknowledged to all the concerned parties and owners are trying to find a drastic solution. Again please accept my apology and I hope that this hasn’t put you off a return stay with us again. Looking forward to that  I would like to thank you once again for your time to review and wish you all the best. With kindest regards  The Eos Team Show more
6633057,Ross July 2017 We enjoyed the quiet  rural setting - it was very relaxing. We enjoyed the sense of space - a large garden  big house and big pool. Although we didn't cook much  the kitchen is well equipped. Ensure you take adequate mosquito protection - they are the only negative. It is great for a large family or even a group of friends - we love Greece and this is our favourite of similar locations in Crete and Kefalonia. We will be back ! Response from Sofronios July 2017 Dear Ross   Hello from Eos.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.  I am delighted that your stay with us was enjoyable. The whole Eos Team works hard to ensure that your holiday is a success  so it is always nice to hear positive feedback from our clients - it makes all the effort worthwhile.

Poulades is a very quiet and green place  and centrally located  close to Corfu Town and the beautiful beaches of Paleokastritsa.

6633057,Efrosini August 2015 House was very spacious  but also cosy. Garden  pool and outdoor entertainment area as shown and well maintained. The pool was cleaned every 3 days. However  no TV; lacked basic kitchen ingredients like oil. However  had many kitchen materials such as glasses  plates  saucepans. Sofronios was very helpful- we called on a Sunday night to report a concern and he was very prompt in tending to it. There was also a cleaner who came and also changed towels during our 5 night stay. I highly recommend the villa.

6633057,Kostas August 2017 Really beautiful house in a quiet area. But because it's in the countryside  it has bugs and dust. The pool needs more frequent cleaning. Generally  it is offered for quiet family vacations. It's not close to beaches on the island but it's close to the city. The communication was good  and the instructions for accessing each other were excellent. We had a problem with the power outage  and we had trouble finding a solution with the electrical installation of the house-admin organization but “automated” so if there's an issue you need to solve it yourself. But I thank EOS in particular for their professionalism. Costas Translated from Greek  Show original Response from Sofronios August 2017 Dear Kostas  Good morning from Eos.
