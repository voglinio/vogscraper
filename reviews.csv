1/1/1111,50,Lovely staff at The Standard Grill,"I went for dinner at the standard grill and to my surprise there was live music. I enjoyed the band over drinks while waiting for my friend who was running late. The host was so sweet and took us right to our table where we had a fabulous dinner!! The server who took care of us gave us the perfect amount of attention, while also giving us privacy to enjoy our meal. A trip to the grill is absolutely not complete without a photo shoot on your way to the bathroom. Floor to ceiling mirrors OKAY.   I also loved how much variety was amongst the dinner crowd. There were couple out to eat, families having dinner, girls night, etc‚Ä¶  All of the staff at the bar, hostess stand and in the restaurant were very friendly."
1/1/1111,50,"A new ""classic"" NYC experience - always A+","I love the Standard, High Line.  First off, the location is tough to beat, probably the best in the city IMHO.  But as a New Yorker, I am less focused on location and more about the property and experience.  You probably know that the Standard is perched above the High Line, with giant floor to ceiling glass windows.  The entire city unfolds before you, and because its the tallest thing around, almost any floor or exposure offers a dynamite view.  It is captivating and I never turn on the TV because you have the best live show right in front of you.  The service is punctual, friendly and not at all hovering.  Everything you want/need but nothing extraneous if you prefer to be left to your own devices.  The interior has also become an NYC classic--innovative but not sterile, comfortable but not boring.   The rooms are calming, stylish and of course clean.  In non-Covid times, the Top of the Standard (formerly Boom Boom Room) is the hottest ticket in NYC.  But there are plenty of welcomed Covid adaptations around property, including a cozy outdoor screening room and the beer garden, which is open and well ventilated.  I haven't tried the new Standard Grille yet, but when I'm back from LA it's top of my list.   The Standard High Line is like a current day, downtown version of the Carlyle or Pierre.  It says something about New York, and it means if you're staying there, you are in the know too.‚Ä¶"
1/1/1111,50,New York's Finest,"Fantastic food, fantastic room and Seth made sure I had everything I needed. The bed was extremely comfortable too.  The High Line walk is a must do and the hotel is perfectly situated for that.  I will be back for a longer stay as soon as I can.  "
1/1/1111,50,Service Above Standard + Seth,"The service and care in this place is unmatched. It felt like the love that New York brings was bottled in one hotel. Especially from my boi Seth, who gave us a smooth check out and went above and beyond. If you‚Äôre downtown this is where you want to be. (And the view of the Hudson is craaaazy.)"
1/1/1111,50,Dinner at The Standard Grill,"Loved our dinner here. It‚Äôs an iconic NYC staple and the vibe is always amazing. Gorgeous, luxurious restaurant with delicious food and fabulous service. The broccoli pancakes, steak frites, and martinis are outstanding."
1/1/1111,50,Fantastic restaurant,"The food at The Grill was absolutely incredible, highly recommend. Delicious cocktails as well. Fantastic date night, including wonderful service from the staff and attention. The Plaza also has a separate menu that is perfect for lunch. "
1/1/1111,50,The Standard live music,"The standard live music sessions on Thursday nights are the highlight of my week. Such amazing talent from the likes of Paige and the other amazing musicians. Highly recommend for anyone who loves great food, great drinks, great vibes and AMAZING music!"
1/1/1111,50,Corporate Happy Hour in the Garden Room,"We had a happy hour for 80 people in the Garden Room at The Standard and were blown away. Our team was over the top impressed with the venue, the food, the drinks, and the service. The staff was outstanding and incredibly attentive and prompt. The drinks were delicious, were served quickly, and there was hardly ever a line. When I brought an issue with a wobbly table to Matt‚Äôs attention, it was addressed immediately and a new one was brought in. Haley was fabulous in helping us plan, and patient throughout the process, even when I had a million questions about food, quantities, etc. Overall excellent experience and hope to go back for a team event again."

1/1/1111,50,AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"SETH really did a great job helping us throughout our entire stay. He was very pleasant and greeted us upon arrival, helped with our bags, and his energy and presence lighted up our stay. He also gave us good advice and took care of us beyond expectations. We‚Äôre definitely staying  here again. Amazing part of town and overall experience."
1/1/1111,50,Great stay at the high line!,I had the best stay at The Standard High Line specifically because of Seth. He was so attentive and his recommendations made our stay nothing short of incredible. Make sure you check out the art installation on the elevators and take a walk on the high line. It is essentially a garden planted along abandoned railroad tracks!
1/1/1111,50,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel with retro vibes. We had an amazing corner room with a great view of the Hudson. The rooftop bar is fantastic, not too crowded and the views of the city at night are incredible. The staff were all very friendly - Seth helped us out on our last day making sure we got off on time"
1/1/1111,50,Excellent stay,My second stay. Great room and view. 11th floor so good views and only a distant boom from the night club. Housekeeping superb. Room service was delicious and expedient We went up to Le Bain which was simply stunning. Seth at the front door was super kind I‚Äôm getting our car to the airport. Check in and out smooth ms efficient. Room could do with more power sockets and a coffee machine.

1/1/1111,50,AMAZING EXPERIENCE,"SETH really did a great job helping us throughout our entire stay. He was very pleasant and greeted us upon arrival, helped with our bags, and his energy and presence lighted up our stay. He also gave us good advice and took care of us beyond expectations. We‚Äôre definitely staying  here again. Amazing part of town and overall experience."
1/1/1111,50,Great stay at the high line!,I had the best stay at The Standard High Line specifically because of Seth. He was so attentive and his recommendations made our stay nothing short of incredible. Make sure you check out the art installation on the elevators and take a walk on the high line. It is essentially a garden planted along abandoned railroad tracks!
1/1/1111,50,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel with retro vibes. We had an amazing corner room with a great view of the Hudson.

The server who took care of us gave us the perfect amount of attention, while also giving us privacy to enjoy our meal. A trip to the grill is absolutely not complete without a photo shoot on your way to the bathroom. Floor to ceiling mirrors OKAY.   I also loved how much variety was amongst the dinner crowd.

1/1/1111,50,"A new ""classic"" NYC experience - always A+","I love the Standard, High Line.  First off, the location is tough to beat, probably the best in the city IMHO.  But as a New Yorker, I am less focused on location and more about the property and experience.  You probably know that the Standard is perched above the High Line, with giant floor to ceiling glass windows.  The entire city unfolds before you, and because its the tallest thing around, almost any floor or exposure offers a dynamite view.  It is captivating and I never turn on the TV because you have the best live show right in front of you.  The service is punctual, friendly and not at all hovering.

The drinks were delicious, were served quickly, and there was hardly ever a line. When I brought an issue with a wobbly table to Matt‚Äôs attention, it was addressed immediately and a new one was brought in. Haley was fabulous in helping us plan, and patient throughout the process, even when I had a million questions about food, quantities, etc. Overall excellent experience and hope to go back for a team event again."

1/1/1111,50,Best time at the Standard Grill!!,This hotel is great! They have live music every Thursday at the Standard Grill and it was the BEST time!!! Delicious food too! Definitely have to visit if you haven‚Äôt!!! In a great area in Manhattan and easy to travel to other areas of the city!
1/1/1111,50,Standard Grill is amazing!,We went to the Standard Grill for dinner - the food and cocktails were amazing. There was also incredible live music and the staff was attentive and welcoming. We had an absolute blast! Can't recommend enough!!!
1/1/1111,50,Elevated Expectations,"The Standard hotels raise your expectations for other hotels to an all Pat unfair degree.    I was in a bad mood from the airport but I arrived to an amazing drag show in the plaza ( take my money Essa Noche!) and I couldn‚Äôt help but be cracking up and wanting to join the antics as I checked in.    Walking into the hotel is an experience all on its own but my room had a view to die for and a tub that was calling my name after a long day on my feet.    If you are here do yourself a favor and check out the gym even if that‚Äôs not your thing. The expansive view of the city had my awestruck on my morning run.    And then undo all that hard work at the gym downstairs at the grill. There‚Äôs a truffle butter pancake that now loves rent free in my mind and may be an entire reason to fly back to NYC.    I ate well, partied well, slept well. What more is there to say?"
1/1/1111,20,noisy and poorly soundproofed with the club noisy and poorly soundproofed les bains we were at the 14th floor !!!,noisy and poorly soundproofed with the club Les Bains we were at the 14th floor !!! We couldn‚Äôt sleep !!!!  Even you hear a little bit the noise of the street !!!! With this standing everything has to be perfect !!!! So sad !!! They should put triple glazing !!!
1/1/1111,20,Awful,"Might be good for 20 somethings, but not for me. Noise, noise, noise. The primary product of a hotel is sleep. Noise from outside, noise from down below, marijuana fumes everywhere, the elevator, the hallways. I'm not a prude, but c'mon.    Front desk people are quite nice and want to please. Seth the bellman is terrific.    Rooms are weird...bathrooms are strange, small, toilet in a separate teeny, tiny room/closet w/no ventilation. Towels are good. Bed is comfortable.    Icing on the cake was the gift shop carrying mirror coasters with artificial lines of cocaine. Are you serious?    Never, never, never again."
1/1/1111,20,Not For Me...,"The bed was hard, the sound coming into the room was as though a club was next door. I informed the front desk that I didn't want to be right under the club (on the 18th) they put me on the 13th, and it felt like I was either above or next door to the club. My partner couldn't sleep. When we checked out, we weren't even asked about our stay. Not a place I would recommend, which is to bad, because I lived in New York for a long time and always wondered what it would be like to stay at the Standard, now I know, and I won't be making that mistake again."
1/1/1111,20,Very Disappointed,"Upon a recommendation from two different friends, I was excited to stay at The Standard, High Line for our 10-year anniversary. We booked a 7-day trip to NYC and this hotel seemed to fit our needs when considering location and price. Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations. Immediately, upon check-in there was a snafu. The desk receptionist tried to charge us for fees we apparently did not owe and then never completed our check-in. When we finally discovered the error, we were refunded the three (3) erroneous charges on our card, but the manager who assisted us was nothing short of rude and seemed to imply we were somehow at fault. I could have gotten past this as one rude individual is not going to ruin my stay, but the hits just kept coming. First, the rooms are TINY. Again, this alone will not make or break a hotel for me, but considering we were staying for 7 days, there was only one small closet with a couple of very hard to reach shelves and 4 hangers for all of our clothing. Not a single dresser or any other adequate storage was in the room. For reference I believe we were in a Deluxe King Room. I did inquire about upgrading to a different room type, but the next upgrade was to a suite which would have cost us $2000 more for our stay and I was informed that although larger, it also had no more storage than our current room. This hotel apparently does not really expect extended stay customers so take that into consideration. Second, even most cheap hotels these days provide complimentary coffee. Not this hotel. Want coffee? Order a pot from room service every day or take yourself down the street to Starbucks. For the price of the room, coffee would have been nice. Third, the refrigerator in our room serving as the minibar was non-functioning. All the beverages were room temperature including the champagne. Again, for the price of the room, a working refrigerator does not seem too much to ask. Fourth, although we loved the location in theory, it never occurred to us that we would have a dance party in our room every night. There are so many bars located around the hotel we literally had competing dance songs in our room until 12:30 or later every night. No big deal if you are into the club scene and out yourself, but for those of us who would like to call it night at a decent hour, it was obnoxious. The music was so loud, I could still hear every word of every song even with my AirPods on noise canceling playing white noise. To be clear, we were not necessarily trying to go to sleep at some early hour and a couple of nights we were out late enough it ended soon after we got in bed but I cannot stress how crazy loud the music was when it started. Fifth, apparently the hotel is doing some remodeling so we had painters on our floor every day. It would have been nice to have been told that was going to be taking place when we checked in as we walked out of our room onto paint tarps and wet-paint walls every day. Sixth, there is no concierge. If you have questions about anything like ""What is the best way to get to MetLife from this location"" or ""Can you recommend a great Italian restaurant nearby"", the hotel staff is clueless and literally Googles it while you wait. Come on! I'm perfectly capable of using Google myself. At this price-point, I expect the hotel staff (or more specifically a concierge) to be available to assist guests. Seventh, it is dark. The elevators are dark. The shower is very dark (unless you open the slatted wall and the curtains). Prudish of me I know but I'd just as soon not have all of NYC watching me shower. To be fair and why I'm giving it at least two stars, not everything was bad. The views are gorgeous! We had a view of the Hudson and Lower Manhattan that was superb. The hotel bars and dining were excellent as were their staff. Although we hated the bar music at night, the location of the hotel itself was very convenient for walking along the Hudson, it was nearby to subway stations and literally close to tons of fantastic bars, restaurants and shopping. In end, we were just extremely disappointed. Any one of the disappointments could have been overlooked, but they just kept piling on. Maybe we expected too much, but we certainly expected more than noise, broken appliances, remodeling and staff who were unable or unwilling to assist with our needs. If you're going for a couple of days and want a hip hotel in the heart of the party, look no further. If you are planning to stay awhile and do something other than party every night, don't choose this hotel."
1/1/1111,50,Seth is the best,"Great hotel‚Ä¶just a bit noisy if you stay in top floors with South view. Service is great, room are nice and gym is top notch level. Club is also a great experience with an astonishing view all over NY. We will definitely come back in the future asap"
1/1/1111,20,Not my kind of place,"The minimalist d√©cor, small room, hard bed, limited lighting, no coffee pot, etc. Is just not what i need in a hotel experience. The neighborhood was very stretchy at night with no grocery close by. Also, my neighbors complained that my TV was too loud. there must be no sound insulation in the walls. I had a big scary security guard knocking on my door at 11PM to lower my TV."
1/1/1111,50,Standard Hotel,"Great experience, architecture was extremely cool. We had dinner at the restaurant and it was good. Seth the doorman was very nice. Overall memorable experience that I would recommend to anybody visiting new york"
1/1/1111,50,Great stay,Had a great stay! Excellent location with a lot to do in the area. Very walkable. Cool club on the roof and great bars / restaurants connected to the hotel. Seth at the front made sure I was taken care of when I needed it.
1/1/1111,50,Great service and comfort!,Especially from Seth in the lobby and Duncan in the grill. The housekeeping was great and the room was comfortable as well as nicely designed and beautifully lit. The wedding we attended at the boom boom room was amazing and as a whole the stay was very pleasant.
1/1/1111,50,Fall in NY at the Highline,5/5 staff is always great but Seth was especially great and why I‚Äôm writing the review.    Rooms are well laid out and nice  Design.    Easy access to Whitney and highline    Good coffee shops and convenience stores nearby too.    Hotel looks better now without scaffolding
1/1/1111,10,Nice view but that‚Äôs it,"Small rooms, no towel bars in the bathroom for used towels to hang on, tv is on the floor and very hard to see over your feet when in bed. Toilet is in the closet. No iron or coffee maker in the room. The rooftop nightclub could be heard clearly from our 8th floor room until 4am. The lobby of the hotel is very unimpressive as well as the small rooms. For the price I would not stay here again."
1/1/1111,50,I‚Äôll be back,"I have always admired the Standard style when visiting the LA rooftop bar, but this time I got the chance to stay at the Standard High Line in New York. I fell in love with the quality and comfort. Seth was incredible and made sure my stay was flawless! Thank you, Seth!"
1/1/1111,50,Seth rules,"Seth is the best!!! Love that guy. He was extremely helpful and patient and helped me around the movie set out front of the hotel. But why isn‚Äôt the store open? Feels like that was a pretty big missed opportunity, honestly - saw a bunch of people standing outside, waiting‚Ä¶."
1/1/1111,50,Just the best!,"The rooms offer the best views, comfortable beds and the sweetest and helpful staff, we are always delighted with our stays here. We love the Greenwich and West Village, and have tested out other hotels, but decided to go back to the Standard because of the fabulous location, professional staff and gorgeous rooms that just can‚Äôt be beat! No more checking out other places, we‚Äôre back for good!  üíï  Gary"
1/1/1111,50,Great customer service,"I travel a lot and I aim to stay at different hotels for the experience. This hotel was outstanding! Great location, excellent views, and the front desk was helpful. I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt acknowledge Jewel for her attentiveness, hospitality, and awesome suggestions. I felt very welcomed and I will make referrals for retreats and outings."
1/1/1111,50,Anniversary,"My wife and I live in NYC and we CHOSE The Standard to stay at for our 17th anniversary. The service (impeccable with a smile), the restaurant (BEST French fried in the world!), the Biergarten (a world class selection), the ambiance (modern day romance), the room came (a view that captures the true essence of NYC - floor to ceiling windows with of view of bright lights of the city at night, a comfortable King Size bed with soft sheets, a sitting arrangement made for hosting guests or and intimate affair, and showers were to die for), the EVERYTHING was perfect. In the AM we visited a local diner for breakfast then walked the High Line and caught a webinar at the Samsung store across the street. All of this within a block of the location. We had a wonderful time. This location is DOPE!!"
1/1/1111,50,Great Staff!,"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, but my visit was made complete by a staff named Jewel. Super sweetheart and she really didn‚Äôt have to be. She was very attentive and understanding. She made my stay in the city so much more accommodating as well as put me on to great spots for food! Thank you soo much Jewel and The Standard ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
1/1/1111,50,Patient team!,"My family and I had an amazing stay and had a warm welcome from Jewel. She is a knowledgeable of the area (restaurants, activities to do) and was very patient with answering all of our many inquiries. My partner and I still have a few locations to visit but were very pleased with the customer service received."
1/1/1111,50,Loved it !,"Arrived and checked in and upgraded by Jay and Kabaysha who were very friendly and knowledgable. I had booked a time slot at the Edge before I came and they were able to get me a taxi as I was running late. My corner room was amazing and had a wonderful view of the ESB as soon as I opened the curtains. I loved everything about the room, and the area. A short walk over to the Little Island, which was lovely. Had breakfast both mornings in the Standard Grill, Amazing French Toast ! I loved sitting outside just enjoying the weather with a glass of wine! I will definitely be back when I return to the city! I was looked after very well by Jay and Aldo who were always there to lend a hand ! Thank you to them."
1/1/1111,50,exactly what we needed,"We biked 275+ miles in three days from Boston to New York in a cycle for the Cause. We really appreciated that The Standard was totally fine with us having our bikes in the elevators and hotel room. Our room was incredibly spacious, had great views of the high line / city and I loved the huge tub for an epsom salt bath. Jay at the front desk was wonderful when we were checking in."
1/1/1111,50,Great stay,"Our corner king was great, with beautiful views, clean, high water pressure in the shower. Gym was well stocked for a hotel. Seth was personable and very helpful with our bags and getting us to JFK. Thank you!"
1/1/1111,50,Great stay at Standard,The Standard was a great location and the rooms were perfect. Seth was a huge help and took care of my bags and helped get me a cab to the airport. I would recommend to anyone staying in New York for a couples vacation.
1/1/1111,50,My new fave hotel in NYC!,Last weekend I stayed at this gorgeous hotel for my 30th birthday! The location near the highline and meat packing district was perfection. The views from the room were jaw dropping and the food was out of this world. The staff was so attentive and I have to give a shout out to SETH - who made our entire stay! Will be back soon for another staycation!
1/1/1111,20,avoid the 16th floor at all costs,"The Standard is definitely a nice hotel. However, the 17th floor is a disco that goes until 4am. That made it nearly impossible to sleep in my room on the 16th floor. It was super loud with music, and the bass reverberated in my room. Definitely the worst sleeping environment I've ever had at a hotel. Little to no sleep for 2 nights (on a Tuesday night, and on a Wednesday night).  At a minimum, they should WARN people considering the 16th floor of this."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing time (Thanks Seth :)),"Had an amazing stay at the Standard! From the helpful and friendly staff, to the lovely food and accommodating team, it was all great. Seth especially was amazing at ensuring my accommodation needs were met and ensured I had a safe way back to the airport. Five stars! :)"
1/1/1111,40,Location Location Location,"We booked a Corner King room and the views were pretty good.  Statue of Liberty, The Hudson, Empire State building.  Spacious shower room with a view.  Shame about the small wardrobe space.  Kingsize bed was very comfortable.  Bars and restaurants within the hotel had a great vibe and atmosphere and not too far from Chelsea Village and other bars and restaurants.  We will return"
1/1/1111,50,"Great service, friendly bell boys!",Had a great stay at the standard! Especially thankful for the Bell boy Seth who helped me with my many heavy bags! I also liked the rooms and how light and Airy they are. It was hard to get through to room Serivce so I had to go downstairs and order myself but I‚Äôm sure they were just really busy
1/1/1111,50,amazing hotel!,"I recently stayed at The Standard for a bachelorette party and the staff did everything they could do make our stay incredibly enjoyable!! From the welcome note in the room, to the assistance with getting us set up in Le Bain, everything was perfect.    The Standard is a NY institution for a reason!"
1/1/1111,50,Look no further for the best NYC hotel!,"I recently stayed at the Standard High Line and WOW. The location is right in the middle of Meatpacking District, one of the best neighborhoods in downtown Manhattan. The staff was so helpful and friendly, giving us the best recommendations. Our views of the Hudson River and the city skyline were unbeatable. If you want an unforgettable New York experience, you MUST add The Standard to your list!!"
1/1/1111,50,Love this Hotel!,"The Standard High Line is in our favorite part of the city - location, location, location!  Our 5th floor room overlooked the High Line, and we were able to see the Empire State Building from our window. We loved the shower and super comfortable bed,  We'd would also like to especially thank Aldo Garcia who helped make our anniversary weekend a special one."
1/1/1111,50,Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I absolutely love this hotel! It‚Äôs our favorite one in the city. So of course we spent our third wedding anniversary here. The decor, food and service are always on point. Jewell and the rest of the staff at the front desk were very accommodating. I hope they reopen the Piano Room soon so we have another excuse to come back."
1/1/1111,50,Wonderful Stay,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience that exceeded our expectations. The staff greeting us at the door and helping at checking were very friendly including Jewel, who helped us check out. The accommodations were very clean. We appreciated the hold bag service so that we could still go and explore the city while waiting for our room. The convenience of being close to the Highline and many restaurants was great. Felt very safe. The rooftop bar that is associated with the hotel also exceeded expectations. Felt like we got the whole NYC experience staying at the Standard and would stay again."
1/1/1111,50,Dinner at Grill,"We had an awesome time dining at the Grill restuarant in Standard Hotel. Great food, great service and great atmosphere for family and friends. Our server Isreel was very kind and so helpful, he frequently came around to make sure if we needed anything else. Mac and Olga was also very sweet and helpful. What a beautiful experience! I highly recommend this place to everyone. You have to experience to believe! Btw, I ordered the million dollar chicken from the menu, after eating that, I felt like a billionaire!!lol Awesomeness!!!!"
1/1/1111,50,Excellent Restaurant in NYC,I am visiting from Florida and was very impressed with the service at the restaurant. Our server Izreal was so professional and courteous! The food was incredibly awesome! Mac and Olga were also exceptional!! I highly recommend anyone visiting NY should definitely try this restaurant. You wont regret it.
1/1/1111,50,"The Standard, Highline","Not just a hotel stay, a cultural experience! Amazing staff, views, food and nightlife. Will definitely return and am very glad I chose this hotel. Would recommend for anyone that wants to a true new york stay!"
1/1/1111,50,Girls weekend,Amazing hotel! Great hospitality! Would come back here every time! Food was delicious at the Grill. Walking distance to so much! Staff was so welcoming and helpful. Thank you for a wonderful stay and see you soon!
1/1/1111,50,Visited for our 5th anniversary,"Had an awesome time. Fantastic location and great rooms. Plenty of awesome restaurants steps outside of the hotel. Enjoyed stepping out in the morning for a walk on the Highline. Awesome hotel! Very welcoming and helpful staff, especially Seth."
1/1/1111,50,The Standard Stay,Great stay food was excellent and cocktails are world class.    The cleaning staff really went out of their way to not only clean the room but organised all my things every night and ensured everything is order.    Best location in NYC close to every location including the Chelsea market.    Seth was in particular was very welcoming.
1/1/1111,50,A stupendous stay,"I can‚Äôt say enough about this hotel, the locale, the decor, vibe and the staff. They do it all right. Our room is so comfortable. The food has been wonderful. Not one detail is overlooked here. All our needs and requests were met with an exuberant yes, no problem. Will not stay anywhere else again while here. Amazing"
1/1/1111,50,Terrific stay.,Terrific view. Abdolutely love it. We had such a great room with one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept on. They had such perfect and nice staff. The breakfast was really good and the restaurant was pretty.
1/1/1111,50,The Place to Be,"Great staff, rooms, bars and location in NYC.  Jewel at front desk was awesome! Big fan of the entire hotel and it's location in the meatpacking district was perfect. We will be back again. Close to many bars and restaurants too."
1/1/1111,10,Front Desk Staff & Manager Exceedingly Rude & Elevator Delay of 55 Minutes,"On September 12th. 2022 about 20 guests of the Standard Highline were stuck for 50 minutes at the elevator bank of 4 elevators on the 17th floor of the hotel waiting for an elevator. My friend and I were two of them. After being stuck for so long I started to have a panic attack and claustrophobia and decided to take the stairs. I opened the door to the stairwell and access to the stairs was blocked by a rope and a guard who was watching over the stuck patrons yelled at me; ""You cannot take the stairs!"" which, as far as I know, is illegal. Due to the delay with the elevator my friend and I lost our dinner reservations to a fine restaurant. When finally a packed elevator arrived on the 17th floor we squeezed on, and the elevator stopped at every floor on the way down. When we finally got out at the lobby of the Standard Highline another patron and I went to complain at the front desk. The staff was completely rude. Not one person apologized or offered to compensate us for our lost time and trauma. The following day I went back to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He gave me a completely insincere apology and scowled at me and made no effort to compensate me for ruining my one night visit to NYC and reunion with my friend. I have never been treated so rudely at any establishment in the several decades of adulthood.More"
1/1/1111,50,Great visit,Had a great time staying at the standard! The hotel is Close to many great restaurants and shopping! Seth was lovely and super helpful at the front desk. Everyone was very friendly even with events going on.
1/1/1111,50,Great location and vibe!,"The standard is a great hotel with perfect proximity to Chelsea Market. Trendy vibe, really nice staff and comfortable accommodations. Food was also delicious and drinks were on point. Would definitely stay again!"
1/1/1111,50,Entrepreneur,"Seth was super duper efficient, friendly and professional. I was flustered with business and he helped my multitask by booking me a car, helping with luggage and messenger items for my client Alton.  Thank you!"
1/1/1111,40,Longtime customer and never disappointed.,"Longtime customer and never disappointed. Rooms are a bit small but the location makes up for it. Even if you don‚Äôt like to party, it‚Äôs a great spot to be based and walk around. Great vibe and service. Seth the bellman was very helpful upon checkout. I‚Äôll be back."
1/1/1111,50,Dr,"Everyone was great but Seth was, by far, the most helpful and kind of the staff. We had a great time and would certainly come back.  Great food, cheerful place, and a very sophisticated party scene, yet somehow a good night‚Äôs rest with no loud noises"
1/1/1111,50,"Great location, great vibes!",Stayed here for business and although it was fashion week and the hotel was packed it was still calm and very well maintained. Room was very clean and with a stunning view. Seth from reception was super friendly!
1/1/1111,50,AMAZING stay!!!!,the room was absolutely beautiful with an amazing view‚Ä¶ everyone was very helpful and the rooms were super clean. the food was very good and the customer service was more than perfect. big shoutout to SETH!!! <3
1/1/1111,50,Staff 5 out of 5! Awesome river views,"Great people‚Äîreally tried to help how they could and were super courteous. And gorgeous view from our floor to ceiling windows.    This place is definitely a hub. We were there for a business trip, which accidentally coincided with Vogue World literally down the street, which made the entire hotel crazy hectic and booked. So good to keep in mind what events are happening‚Äîcould be a huge plus and also mess with your flow, depending on your goals."
1/1/1111,20,"Cool hotel, Atrocious service","Great location, cool hotel, but service is pretty terrible. Took forever to get waitstaff attention at restaurants, keycards didn't work, people looked annoyed whenever asked to help. We had the Empire Suite and it didn't help one bit. If you're planning a special weekend I'd look elsewhere."
1/1/1111,50,The Standard IS the standard,"I couldn‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else. The Standard features elegant rooms and spectacular views. Additionally, our family felt the location was perfect. It was far enough from the city center to not feel super crowded, but close enough to feel like you are still in the action. It is walking distance from a plethora of amazing restaurants, and in fact features an outstanding restaurant itself. I would only stay at The Standard."
1/1/1111,50,Sets the Standard,"Great location, amazing view across the Hudson, super friendly and helpful staff, beautiful room, lovely breakfast. This is our third stay at this property and we will be back in October. It‚Äôs our home away from home in NY. Whitney museum right down the street, Highline below and little island across the street. Ideal!"
1/1/1111,50,NY favorite,"Once again The Standard Highline exceeded our expectations . We were already aware of its can‚Äôt be beat location ( truly) from previous stays but the staff was so unbelievably nice and accommodating. Food is deelish, comfy beds, love the bath products. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!!"
1/1/1111,30,The Standard of The Standard High Line is rather low,"Good things first: the view is amazing and unbeatable, definitely two stars for that. The food you get both in the restaurant as well as for roomservice is good value for money, so one star for this ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs about it. Rooms are fairly run down and not well cleaned. The staff is posher and hipper than any guest, arrogance rules unfortunately combined with low competence and problem solving skills. The rooftop bar is flooded with non-hotel guest and staff is too conflict averse to get your reserved table free of people. The legendary Top of the Standard Bar is unfortunately still only open for private events, so now you not only have party noise from the night club Le Bain but also from the bar side, without being able to also enjoy this beautiful place. All of this would be ok, if the room prices would be moderate, but they are not. I love the meatpacking district, but I don‚Äôt think that it will be the Standard again next time."
1/1/1111,40,Meatpacking Marvelous!,"Staying at the Standard High Line is a true NYC experience. Fantastic location in the Meatpacking District, close to great food & shopping not to mention people watching. Loved the outdoor patio for coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening. A Manhattan stay that shouldn‚Äôt be missed"
1/1/1111,50,Wonderful getaway!,This was our third visit to this hotel and we love it more each time. The staff was wonderful and helpful. The view from the room is amazing. The area is very friendly and walkable. We plan to return for another getaway soon. We highly recommend the Standard!
1/1/1111,50,Above The Standard!,"All the staff here were  Wonderful. When we got here we didn‚Äôt have a hair dryer in the room. We called down and 5 minutes later we had a hair dryer. There was a wonderful server in the restaurant who went the extra mile to find us a table when they had to close the patio due to fashion week. On our last day, Seth was Superman storing our luggage and getting a cab for us to get to the airport when half the streets were closed for fashion week. The Standard is a cut above."
1/1/1111,50,"Great employees, great service, great fitness center, room kinda small","Everything was great except the room was pretty small for the level of luxury we were otherwise enjoying. Seth at the front desk was particularly helpful getting us situated with a cab to Newarks airport with a bunch of luggage during a hectic day (9/11 commemoration, fashion week, etc.).    Another employee at the restaurant was especially helpful getting us seated for a drink during an extremely busy Friday night.    I would definitely stay here again!"
1/1/1111,10,Worst experience,Currently being harassed by the staff to accept a substandard room - not willing consider my point of view - regret booking this hotel - just getting harassed and have effectively spoiled by visit - had high hope- watch out for their differentiating treatment for the same room rate
1/1/1111,20,Not the most comfortable for a business traveler,"Not really set up for business traveler. Wi-Fi connection intermittent, phone didn‚Äôt work so couldn‚Äôt call room service, no room service before 7 am and and no coffee in the rooms. It‚Äôs loud and you can hear guests thru the walls. Bed was comfortable but on a platform on the floor."
1/1/1111,50,Taxi and baggage help,Wanted to thank Seth for an easy transition to my flight to jfk. Seth took the time to grab me a taxi and carried my heavy bag. Thank you for your generosity Seth! Had a wonderful time at the Highline
1/1/1111,50,Boutique luxury in meatpacking,Gave our little man toys at the desk! Proceeded to upgrade our room‚Ä¶ friendly staff and great in hotel restaurant‚Ä¶ catered to our little guy given peanut allergies. Rooftop is superb and very convenient near soho and west village. A must when in town.
1/1/1111,50,Soooo Coooool,"This hotel is uber hip and exceedingly cool. Everywhere you stand in the hotel there is something awesome to look at. From the incredible elevator art to the incredible views from the full height glass window in your room. The staff of young, fun, helpful, and friendly folks really seem to enjoy working at the hotel. I have to thank Aaron the beverage manager particularly as he introduced us to some fantastic new drinks and is truly one of the nicest people we met in NYC. Cheers, Aaron! The location of the Standard High Line is exceptional also...steps away from amazing restaurants and shops and Chelsea Market. If you want someplace different and cool and fun to stay in NYC, you MUST stay at the Standard High Line."
1/1/1111,50,Always a great stay,"Great location, great restaurants / bars, and front desk staff that can‚Äôt be beat in NYC. Don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I have a smile on my face in the cab to the airport (that staff hailed for me and put me into) and knew I had to. Seth especially is a gem!"
1/1/1111,50,Standard Hotel Stay,"The hotel is in a great location, lots of cool bars & restaurants nearby.  The hotel had a good gym and comfortable beds. I also liked the glass in the bathroom!  The staff were friendly, especially Seth who helped us with our luggage!"
1/1/1111,50,usopen trip,Everyone at The Standard Highline was amazing and extremely helpful especially Seth who made sure I got to the airport on time and anticipated anything I needed when I was coming and leaving the hotel.
1/1/1111,50,Great stay! Love the place and vibe,Great place in the heart of the city. Everyone is so friendly. I always stay at the Standard on Highline because I love the location. During our last trip Jewel was taking special care of us. Her help and insights were highly appreciated. We loved every minute of our stay. Rooms have great city and river views. The rooftop is amazing. Can not wait for the bar ‚ÄûTop of standard‚Äú reopens.
1/1/1111,50,Standard high line stay,"I had an amazing stay at the standard it‚Äôs my fav property in the city also the staff are incredible especially kabaysha she is the sweetest person , very helpful , knowledgeable about everything and her hospitality is incredible she made me feel home and I will always come back because of amazing treatment of people and staff like that"
1/1/1111,50,Great 10 year anniversary trip!,"This hotel was in the most perfect locations, many places were walking distance. The views were great and the service even better. The room was amazing, with a great view and a king size bed that made it difficult to get up every morning. Definitely recommend getting the burger in their room service menu and spending some hours playing ping pong in the beer garden. Great hotel all around! Can‚Äôt wait to be back."
1/1/1111,50,Labor Day Weekend in NYC,"I had a wonderful 3 night stay, which I extended for another night thanks to excellent service provided by front desk staff such as Andre and Kabaysha, as well Brad who helped with baggage.    All the rooms are trendy with breathtaking views. The location is prime with everything you need in walking distance. I would also recommend this place for Amex member based on the wonderful amenties such as upgrades and dining credits.    My only complaint is regarding parking (have to use a lot 8 min away), but for most I‚Äôm sure this is not an issue and street parking worked out for me."
1/1/1111,20,Choose another location unless you‚Äôre clubbing in the area,"This hotel is placed above a very loud bar on the Hudson River side, further, unless your in an end of hall room you have an obstructed uninteresting view of the River. Don‚Äôt plan to get any sleep if you select that side from at LaSandra Thurs-Sat. On the city view side there is no view of the city unless you‚Äôre on the top two or three floors, but then you‚Äôre placed right below the hotel‚Äôs bar. The furniture is old and painted over, not modern. While it‚Äôs modern style, it looks like it was secured at a flea market. I had a number of issues once moved to the City view side to get some quiet, though the hotel moved quickly to fix any issues and were very polite - like a malfunctioning television and bathroom fixtures that would stick requiring an engineer to come twice. The room service from breakfast was bland. Bacon barely cooked and chewy, English muffins untoasted and I ordered hot tea - wherein the cup and teabag came with no hot water which I had to request again. Despite my inquiry, there was no mention of where to park. Likewise, doing a web-based check in is helpful to secure your room but you still have to stop and go through the whole process minus providing a credit card, which isn‚Äôt a time saver at all."
1/1/1111,50,"Fantastic location, wonderful employees","Chose this hotel because of its proximity to my son‚Äôs apartment. Was extremely happy there. Rooms are nice, housekeeping was excellent and prompt, front desk employees were friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay there again on future trips!!"
1/1/1111,50,Amazing stay,"We had an excellent stay! Hotel had a view of the Statue of Liberty in the distance and amazing view of the Hudson. The staff was phenomenal- especially Seth that helped us with our bags, got us a couple bikes to stroll downtown with, and had us a taxi ready to go at the end! We strongly recommend staying here."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing stay,Seth went above and beyond to help us get to the airport. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and you can even watch live art in the elevator. Chelsea market is within walking distance. They make everything so easy including room service. It‚Äôs a luxurious experience that I haven‚Äôt experienced at any other hotel.
1/1/1111,50,Standard Sessions,I wasn't a guest at the hotel but caught a Standard Sessions (drinks + music). Devon + Paige are delightful and incredibly talented - the music selection was a lovely mix of soul and pop classics with a 90s tilt that made this millenial feel all kinds of nostalgic. Excellent atmosphere!
1/1/1111,50,NA,Kabaysha was amazing!    Very professional and calm. I had just flown in from SFO for work and came to find out I didn‚Äôt have a room booked. She took care of me with grace and got me setup in a matter of minutes.    Thank you Kabaysha for making the start to my travels here at NYC fabulous!!
1/1/1111,50,Honeymooners,"What a beautiful hotel in an amazing location. Stunning views and great bars and restaurants! Drag brunch on Saturday and Trivia with Thorgy Thor on Wednesday was so much fun!    Staff were brilliant, especially Seth who was very helpful and really looked after us."
1/1/1111,50,Stylish Rooms and great location,My partner and I were here for work and the area had a lot of nice shops and restaurants. Room had nice views of the Empire State Building. Hotel staff were friendly especially Seth! Would stay again.
1/1/1111,50,Great stay,Seth the bellman was the best. The hotel was a great stay with some amazing amenities. Rooftop bar is a great great place to enjoy the night view of the city. One of the nice little secrets of NY. So great
1/1/1111,50,Stay at the Standard,Always a great stay! Helpful staff like Seth make sure that everything runs smoothly. Love being on the Highline and near little Island. Great way to decompress after a long day at work. Will keep coming back.
1/1/1111,50,Pamela chapman,"I just finished my stay at The Standard Highline. The staff there made everything so great. Seth was amazing with all his help. I will be back just because of them. Also, the Grill at the Standard has the best food."
