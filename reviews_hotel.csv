1/1/1111,40,Nothing beats the view from the pool!!,"Honestly the view from the pool is potentially one of the best views in Europe. The photos don’t do it justice, it’s a complete wow factor walking out and seeing it. I’d return just to sit there again!!!    The breakfast is amazing, I think perhaps the best I’ve ever had for quality, choice/options and also hot!!    I travelled with my friend and we got a Ionian Sea view suite, which was a bedroom with a open plan bathroom, and a heavy sliding door separating this from the living area. When the door was closed it was very soundproof. Both rooms had wardrobes, tvs and the living room had a sofa which can be made a sofa bed. I would say the sofa bed is suitable for younger teenagers/kids as it’s not the best mattress. The bathroom was pure luxury, amazing rain shower and deep bath! There is a balcony with a day bed accessible through both the rooms.    There is a full programme of classes in the gym - yoga, pilates, hiit etc. i did the the yoga class and it was a vinyasa flow and a pretty tough one, so you’ll get good workouts in!!    The spa was amazing, I had a foot and leg massage twice!! Completely sorted me out! The beds are heated if you like that, you have to ask for it to be turned on.    We had a few niggles with the room specific to our situation and also the hotel does have a very pretentious vibe about it which is why I’ve given it 4* and not 5*. However, if you don’t care about that, definitely book, you won’t regret it!! I will return."
1/1/1111,50,Don't want it to end ...,"My partner and I saved over the last year for a real treat with our long awaited time off. Angsana has been an absolute dream. We lucked out with the weather which always adds a little extra magic to any trip. The facilities and style of the resort are wonderful. The offering generous and meticulous. We both work in hospitality so we understand the dedication and care needed to make a guest's stay feel wonderful. As always a big part falls on the staff who have been really impressive. Professional, jovial, considerate. Anything we have needed, advice, help renting our car... it just gets done with a smile. They have made us feel so special and we are very grateful. We don't want the trip to finish!"
1/1/1111,50,Outstanding hotel,"Angsana Hotel will be a very memorable holiday for us all.  It is located by a very pretty fishing village in the mountains with the most spectacular views.    The service was outstanding from reception to pool staff.  Couldn’t do enough for you.    The staff at breakfast were very attentive and helpful Including Thanos who looked after us every day.    The rooms are clean, spacious and well equipped and the beds were very comfortable.    A very big thank you to Irene who was very professional and friendly and made our stay a really pleasant experience.    We look forward to returning one day very soon."
1/1/1111,50,Corfu's Absolute Best,"The service, food, amenities, views, and drinks, were beyond incredible. We hit the resort lottery for our first trip to Corfu. We also did a private dining birthday experience that was bananas (in a great way)! The restaurant manager, Alexander, treated us like royalty and made great wine recommendations. I would come back in a heartbeat."
1/1/1111,50,Absolutely fabulous hotel,"Absolutely amazing hotel, everything was faultless. Such a special place and an amazing relaxing holiday.  Lots of fabulous tavernas in nearby Benitses for food in the evening if you fancy venturing out."
1/1/1111,30,DISSAPOINTED!,Having heard this was part of the Banyan group I thought why not let’s try it out and compare to the ones in Asia  POSITIVES  On arrival looks an amazing hotel and the view is to die for !  Some of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful  The beds are comfy  NEGATIVES  The hotel walking wise is a long trek to Benitses  Going downs a lot easier but coming back nearly gives you a coronary as it’s a steep windy road .  The answer is to use a cab 10 euros for each way set fare!!  The pools freezing and bed wars are defo in action  The prices for everything are high compared to things in town  38 euros for a bottle of rose  49 euros for a steak  The private beach was nice but closed 3 days into our stay  We lost something under the bed and on looking for it just saw a thick layer of dust underneath!!  The weather was not brilliant during our stay only BBC and CNN news in English to watch in the room  Having tried to stream from our iPhones to the TV with no success we were informed that I phones were not compatible ! (What!)  Some of the staff defo need more training/advice  The spa looked nice but again very expensive.  We are very well travelled and not 5 star snobs but I wouldn’t give this hotel 5* sorry.
1/1/1111,50,Botrini’s Restaurant Recommended for Vegetarian Tasting Menu,"This is a review for Botrini’s Restaurant at the Angsana Hotel. Though we did not stay at the property, we ate at two of their restaurants (the other being the Asian one).    Botrini’s is a fine dining restaurant, about a 15 minute drive from the Domes Miramare hotel, where we stayed. (I really wish our hotel had been more forthcoming with fine dining options, other than their own restaurant, in the area. This hotel has several of them, all worth the short drive over).    My partner and I opted for the vegetarian tasting menu. Several course are pictured below, and all were delicious. The view, the service, the entire experience was very special. (Vegetarian tasting was 120 euros per person, not cheap as compared to the tavernas in the area, but well within the price range of most fine dining degustation menus).    Highly recommend this restaurant."
1/1/1111,50,Beautiful hotel & views,Had a wonderful mini break at this beautiful hotel. Had a wonderful Javanese massage which was amazing. The staff were extremely helpful and always on hand.  Not much nearby but perfect if you want to chill our and relax for a few days.
1/1/1111,50,Absolute paradise!!,"Our greeting on arrival to Angsana was truly 5 stars. We were given a welcome gift, drink and a cool towel whilst we sat in the stunning reception and let the staff check us in. Lillian gave us a tour of the hotel before we were taken to our room. Great service.    We had a Woodland view room which was immaculate. Huge bed, and a beautiful bathroom. So comfortable!!    The infinity pool was just amazing, we haven’t seen anything quite like it. The surrounding area, Sunbeds, Cabanas and bar were superb. There was always lots of choice of where to sit. We opted for the Cabana as it had ample shade and was so comfortable. Everything was so clean, and the service again was superb. The view really takes your breath away. Another gem was the private beach, only a short shuttle ride away with crystal clear water, comfortable sun beds and delicious cocktails. There was a great choice of water sports from paddle boarding to jet skiing. Nikos was a star.    We ate in all the onsite restaurants. Sofrito’s was the first restaurant we dined in. This restaurant is poolside and we thought it maybe a casual dining affair in the evening, but wow, we were so impressed. The food was outstanding and the service second to none. Thanos, Marios (behind the bar – amazing cocktails) Spiros, Magda and the wonderful Victoria really looked after us and made the evenings spent there so much fun.    Koh was a great experience as it is located on the 5th floor with 360 views which are truly breath-taking, not the mention the stunning decor. The restaurant is London chic, with a very cool, relaxed ambience. The sashimi and sushi were the standouts. We felt that this was quite expensive for what we ate and the price of some of the drinks were very overpriced. Having said that, would go again tomorrow if given the chance.    The absolute standout meal of the week was Botrini’s. This was spectacular. I am not a fan of the term “foodie” but food is our passion at home and to have the opportunity to experience this was such a treat. The Maître d (wish I could remember his name), he really was the epitome of cool. His service, food knowledge and professionalism were impeccable. All the dishes told a story of Corfiot history, which made the meal even more intriguing.    The whole Angsana experience is one we will never forget, and we are already looking to book again next year. Irene (head of customer relations) is fantastic. Such a personality and so humble in her ability to ensure every guest has the best stay. But the absolute jewel in the Corfiot crown was Victoria. She was just the best. Thank you for making our stay so special.    Cannot wait to see you all again next year"
1/1/1111,50,A little gem of paradise!!,We came to this hotel for 7 nights and our stay was a wonderful experience. The hotel is stunning with spectacular views of the Ionian Sea. All the staff are warm and friendly and very attentive to all your needs. Alexandra and katia are brill with helping you to find a great place to eat in the town of Benitses. Also beautiful sites like mouse island. This hotel won’t disappoint you. The breakfast is amazing with lots of yummy choices!! Hot and cold. The rooms are spotless and freshen every day. Truly a very relaxing holiday. We will definitely be back soon.    A BIG thank you to everyone at the Angsana hotel.
1/1/1111,40,Same food choice every day!,"Here for 2 weeks & the hotel is lovely, modern with friendly staff, in the main. However we knew there would be only 2 choices of restaurant on half board but didn't realise that the choices didn't change at all! Being vegetarian restricted it even more & by the end of week one had paid to eat out in Benitses twice. We were told we could eat at the pool bar but the close this when it looks like rain & don't provide anywhere else to have this menu. The prices for drinks is absolutely horrendous & it doesn't need to be, 1 very small glass of tasteless wine 12 or 14 euro, bottle of beer €6, 1 litre bottle of water €6. Malibu & diet coke €15!! Hotel is lovely but wouldn't come here again unfortunately. We decided to spend a lot of money for this fortnight's holiday after not being abroad for nearly 3 years but could have chosen a better one elsewhere for about £2000 less."
1/1/1111,50,great stay at Angsana !,"Our start at Angsana Corfu started with a slight disappointment as the room we had been given was not the room we thought we had booked on the hotel website but this issue has been promptly taken care of by Irene, Assistant Guests Relationship Manager, who suggested to move to another room. We thank the hotel for the understanding and prompt reaction.  This luxury hotel is very modern and elegant with an amazing infinity pool offering a great sea view. The private beach is reachable in 15 min walk or with the shuttles organized by the hotel. It offers calm and a very charming beach bar & restaurant. We ate 3x at the hotel (restaurants Sofrito/Koh/Botrini) and enjoyed the 3 of them with special congratulations for the Botrini testing menu which was a truly delicious experience.  Alternatives restaurants can be found in Benitses village which is at approx 20 min walk but you can find all you need and more at Angsana.  Finally a warm thank you to Irene Tsiknidou for her help in organizing a boat cruise around Paxos/Antipaxos (it was a precious advice and a wonderful day for us !) and for her attentions and care throughout our 2 weeks stay ! Don't miss this resort, it is really worth a stay for the infrastructure, location but also for the hotel teams friendliness."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing resort,"A new resort, well design and very beautiful from the small things to the big, the breakfast is amazing, the service is better than excellent, we took the villa, very big and comfortable, its has 2 floors, the top is big bedroom with big shower and the lower floor is living room and the private pool,  very clear and very relaxing, also the private beach is amazing, so quiet and nice, with WIFI and drinking water and the bar where you can buy great drinks, also there are some water activities but we didn't try.  you can order a taxi in advance and go to the old city (35eur) and to the airport (40eur )  we would defiantly come back again."
1/1/1111,50,Sofrito restaurant,We ate in the Sofrito restaurant several nights during our stay. I can’t recommend it highly enough! The staff were outstanding and so lovely! The food was delicious offering an extensive choice of local and varied delicacies. I would certainly make it a priority to visit this restaurant as it’s wonderful!
1/1/1111,50,Fabulous Hotel on Corfu,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Angsana Corfu for 6 nights. It exceed our expectations on all levels. First, it was beautiful and second the people working there were so nice and service oriented. The food was fabulous - all 4 restaurants and the private beach was the best. I can't say enough good things about it and the island."
1/1/1111,50,Wonderful experience,Highly recommended. It is the best hotel I have experienced in Corfu.  The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very comfortsble. The staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast is exceptional. I shall probably come here again.
1/1/1111,50,Mr,Beautiful set up. Great service. Very very rich breakfast. Spaious and comfortable rooms. Wonderful pool and one of the best spas experienced. A unique experience. It was worth every euro paid. We intend to return.
1/1/1111,50,Amazing stay,"We stayed at the Angsana for 9 days in September and had the best 9 days in Corfu. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. The cleanliness all around, the suite we got with pool and sea view was beautiful. The breakfast is amazing, the staff is on point with amazing service. The hotel is located in a great spot close to a small little town with good restaurants and a 20 min drive to Corfu town. They drive you down to the beach and bring you back every hour and you are greeted with towels and water upon your arrival at the beach. The views from hotel and pool are exceptional, definitely worth it."
1/1/1111,50,Wonderland,"We stayed a full week at Angsana Corfou, looking for a relaxing time to recharge the batteries after spending more than a week traveling and visiting across the Island. Angsana offered exactly what we were looking for:  - outstanding facilities for this very recently built hotel -with a special note for its infinity pool which is particularly amazing and for its very modern gym,  - proper breakfast with extended opening hours allowing you to rest late or leave early,  - incredible restaurants (mainly Koh and the more expensive Botrini's, the latter offering top-notch michelin-star quality food and service),    The only caveat which should be shared to make sure the place is indeed fitting your needs is that this is a family friendly place hence you have to take into account the presence of kids - noisy by nature - wandering around by the pool side.    All in all, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommand it"
1/1/1111,40,Very good hotel in Corfu,Stayed in this lovely hotel in September of 2022 with my friend. We has booked a hotel car to pick us up from the airport which was late and made us wait 20 minutes which wasnt great but they did appologise. We booked the junior suite which was very good! Perfect size and super clean. Housekeeping forgot to do our turn down service that night which was a little upsetting as it is a 5 star luxury and its not nice to come to a room after dinner that hasn't been cleaned with fresh towels. The restaurants are very good and the food was fantastic. The Spa was excellent and highly recommend the 2 hour rain mist massage which was heaven.  The pool area and view is incredible but the beach was a little disappointing. The sea was not very clean and the beach was very small to what you see on the website. shuttles to and from the beach are every half hour which is great. its a 20 minute ride to town so not too far. Staff is very friendly and we had a nice weekend.
1/1/1111,50,Unforgettable experience!,"Wow, what an amazing stay. Upon arrival we were greeted by the most friendly attentive professional staff. We received a lovely hand made bracelet each and refreshing drink. We were then told our room had been upgraded to a sea view suite! I had emailed prior to inform the staff it was our anniversary and if there was anything they could do to surprise my partner however was not expecting this! After a lovely tour of the hotel we proceeded to our suite - and was greeted with a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries. The suite - wow, absolutely beautiful interior. Gorgeous free standing bath, rainfall shower, large terrace with day bed, seats and table with a beautiful view of the pool and sea.  All of the staff, from the receptionists to the drivers were incredibly friendly, polite and helpful. Absolutely impeccable service.  The pool is stunning, the music they play around it is in keeping with the hotels vibe. Only thing I would say regarding the pool is that there definitely are “sunbed hoggers” which the staff don’t seem to do too much about - I noticed several beds that hadn’t been returned to for over an hour with towels and small items such as a hat on them therefore I do think a stricter policy should be reinforced.  Most days we took the minibus down to the private beach which runs every 30 minutes. The private beach is gorgeous, lovely furniture, sun beds and great food and drink selection. Again music in great keeping with the atmosphere. There are also watersports at the beach.  One evening we took a speed boat from the private beach to Corfu town - leaving at 6pm and returning at 11pm. I would highly recommend this - the town is beautiful and it was an amazing way to see this part of Corfu being transported on a lovely boat.  We booked for bed and breakfast only. The breakfast is excellent. Beautifully designed restaurant, huge selection and again fantastic service. You are able to go for breakfast until 11am which is great if you’re not an early bird like me!  There are also 3 other restaurants in the hotel however we did not visit these as we enjoyed spending evenings in the local town Benitses - this is why I booked this hotel as we enjoy to venture out without having to travel far from the hotel.  Benitses is a lovely town with a strip of restaurants. We particularly enjoyed Mr Spiros, Oi Oraies Benitses (traditional Greek) and Picante (Mexican - for when you fancy something a little different but still excellent quality and gorgeous cocktails.  Vertigo sky bar at the hotel is breathtaking. The views are stunning and again excellent service and atmosphere. The cocktails are pricy however this was expected for a rooftop bar of this standard so we didn’t mind indulging a couple of nights.  The hotel will always arrange a taxi for you if you need one and you can put it on your room tab. We used this for a trip to Aqualand and some from and to Benitses. You can walk to Benitses as it is downhill however I wouldn’t recommend walking back as it is quite steep.  My partner took advantage of the gym most days which was very clean and had a diverse range of equipment. There is also a steam room, sauna and jacuzzi in the changing rooms however they are either men or women only therefore I couldn’t enjoy this with my partner.  The room was also cleaned twice daily which I have not experienced before. They also leave small gestures such as chocolates on your pillow - it is the small things such as this that makes Angsana a cut above the rest.  Only thing I would say is that I do think a hotel of this standard should be adults only. There were times when we were disrupted by children which impacted the atmosphere set by the hotel. We also visited out of school holidays therefore I can imagine during school holidays it would not be as peaceful as you would like it to be.  Overall definitely a 5 star experience and I would like to thank all of the staff for their excellent service during our stay, a truly unforgettable experience from start to finish!"
1/1/1111,50,What a place to visit!!,"I have spend 3 nights in this amazing hotel and I have to say WHAT A PLACE TO VISIT!! The location is perfect, the views are stunning, the service impeccable. Rooms are great size with amazing views, the infinity pool is a must and the private beach is great. They take care of every little detail to make sure your stay is flawless. Breakfast is really great and overall the food in the restaurants is top class as is the service (one person i would like to mention is Christina at the restaurant who went above and beyond to make my every visit special). Its not only what you see outside, they have a amazing gym and fantastic spa so you can treat yourself as you like. Overall great stay, I have left so relaxed I didnt want to board the plane. Thank you very much and I cannot wait to be back!!"
1/1/1111,50,!!!! just wonderful,"What can be said about this excellent hotel!!  The hotel is new and designed in a special way, the staff is welcoming and always ready to help with anything.  We arrived at the hotel in the evening with a car, they immediately arrived and unloaded our luggage, the check-in process was efficient, fast and very kind, after that the hostess accompanied us and showed us all the hotel facilities and the room.  Before I booked I saw pictures of the hotel in this case the reality exceeds all imagination.  The small details in the room, the amazing infinity pool, the gym at the highest possible standards, the list of sports classes, the perfect breakfast.  You can add more things, but my recommendation is simply to come...    If I may add, thanks to all the staff for everything."
1/1/1111,50,"Angsana Resort Hotel near Benitses, Corfu","We spent the last week of August at this fantastic hotel and we enjoyed every moment of it. The hotel staff was so professional, friendly and helpful , and I mean each and every person beginning with the people at the reception, the concierge, the valet drivers who parked our rental car after every arrival and drove it up to the entrance whenever we went touring, through the life guards, the waiters at the different restaurants, the people at the spa, the house keeping people and I hope I didn't forget anybody.  The infinity pool was just wonderful and we had a swim every morning before breakfast.  Besides several tavernas in Corfu town and Benitses village, we had dinner at the different restaurants of the hotel. They were all good but our favorites were the Asian and Botrini's chef restaurants.  In short it was an unforgettable experience and a holiday we will always remember."
1/1/1111,50,Review for Sofrito restaurant,"Me and my wife went to Sofrito reastaurant just by the hotel pool for lunch. The food served is of high quality ,the prices are reasonable for a 5 star hotel and the service is very friendly and efficient. I warmly recommend this restaurant not only for hotel guests!"
1/1/1111,40,Nice hotel with great cuisine,"Beautiful modern hotel with great cuisine. We especally enjoyed eating at the hotel's Greek restaurant Sofrito, where the food was delicious and the manager Alexandros was very attentive.    The only thing that could be improved about the hotel is the shuttle service to the beach."
1/1/1111,50,A quick relaxing trip,"One of the best hotels I’ve been too!! Everything was excellent… the staff were so accommodating and professional. So many different cuisines with delicious food! Definitely recommend it to anyone, especially the villas :)"
1/1/1111,50,Amazing hotel,"Amazing hotel, great design, best food, perfect location, very good rooms, perfect spa and pools, great breakfast. Need to improve: bring soft pillows and improve the Communication between the staff  We will come again"
1/1/1111,30,Has potential for a 5 star,"This is a very beautiful and stylish hotel with a lot of potential to become a nice 5 star hotel, however, there are unfortunately still some points which definitely need some improvement for the price people are paying.    First of all, I want to start by mentioning the positiv aspects and highlight the amazing Accor loyalty programme, due to which we got an upgrade to our room to an absolutely stunning suite. The interior of the suite and the view on the sea are absolutely amazing!    Overall, as mentioned, the hotel is very nicely decorated in a very modern way. There is absolutely nothing to complain about the interior and the look of all the facilities.    I also have to say that the service is rather good and almost everyone is very motivated and nice, trying to make you feel as good and relaxed as possible. They also have a valet service which takes care of parking your car every time you come.    However, there are unfortunately still some things which would need improvement and which are unfortunately killing a bit the stay for which customers pay a lot of money:    It starts with breakfast, they really haven’t thought through the space of the eating area as everyone constantly stressed to us to rather arrive before 9 AM in order to avoid any waiting to be seated. Thank god we are rather early birds, but due to that I never went for sports in the morning before breakfast because I was worried we would arrive too late and would have to wait and stand in line to be seated. This is not normal for a 5star hotel, and you should be able to stress free have breakfast whenever you want on your holidays. Moreover, it’s the first time that we have seen a menu where you would have to pay for your warm dishes such as eggs etc at the breakfast in a 5 star hotel! I understand that they provide for different egg dishes which are being prepared in advance and being hold warm in specific container but for the money you pay to stay in this 5 star hotel, it should be a given that you can order any egg dish fresh from the kitchen, at least this has always been the case in any other 5 or even 4 star hotel! Moreover, as you can imagine, the prices were rather outrageous for these dishes…  It’s also a bit sad that the seating area is only inside and not outside given the space they have outside around the pool.    This brings me to my next point, the pool area, and the same goes for the private beach area, do not have enough sun beds to cover even 50% of the guests staying in the hotel. So what happens is that everyone is trying to wake up as early as possible, place the towels on the sun beds to reserve them and then not show up for another 2 hours…which is very frustrating and again stressful in your holidays, where you should be relaxing. Most of the times we therefore left the hotel and did not use any of these facilities as we were not ready to fight for these spots or wait hours to get a sun bed. This is again not normal for a 5 star hotel to not provide for sufficient spots for your guests.    Quick point on the private beach, it is rather small and not the nicest spot to swim in corfu. You also have to reach it with a shuttle which goes every 30 minutes (also more often, if necessary).    We have dared to once check out the famous vertigo bar which is on the rooftop. We went there on a Saturday night, but we were quite disappointed from the lack of any ambience. I think due to the super high prices, no one really goes there, which is a shame cause again the setting and style of this bar is absolutely stunning and beautiful, there were just very few people…    Again, overall a nice and beautiful hotel with a lot of potential, but unfortunately it seems that the style of the hotel was more important than its actual practicality in order to provide its guest with the best comfort."
1/1/1111,10,I don’t came back,"I am staying at the Angsana Hotel until tomorrow. The hotel is beautiful, but the customer service is disappointing so I will not recommend this hotel. At breakfast they asked me to pay extra for cold coffee and an omelette. In the hotel restaurant they asked for an additional payment for spicy mayonnaise sauce. And in addition, there are a lot of bees in the pool that disturb The value I received from the hotel is not worth the money I paid for the vacation"
1/1/1111,50,Fantastic hotel. But eat somewhere else,"The hotel is excellent!! Well designed, professional and pleasant staff, great facilities super location, outstanding infinity pool and great great beach.  As far as food: breakfast is perfect!! Plenty of variety and possibilities even for vegetarians and vegans.  But! Stay clear of the other restaurants and room service. The food is mediocre and highly overpriced ( even compared to hotels). So, it’s really worth having a rented car:) because just around the corner there are lots of great restaurants"
1/1/1111,50,One of a kind experience,"One of the best vacations we've ever had, this resort is one of a kind. Nested between lush green hills and right above the sea, the views are spectacular, and the infinity pool is one of the best in the world. Aggeliki, the guest relations manager and her team were incredibly polite and helpful and they arranged activities around the area for us, including a beautiful boat ride to town where we got to experience the coast of corfu and its treasures from a different view.  The spa was kne of the best we've visited in the world, we had a Thai couples massage in a cabin facing the endless blue.  Vertigo rooftop bar has the craziest views and the sushi was incredible. We're definitely coming back."
1/1/1111,50,Luxury family holiday with one of the best views ever!,"Not sure how people can honestly complain about small unimportant issues with this hotel. We have just got back from the most amazing family holiday and hotel in Angsana, Corfu. We were a party of 6, 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 kids. We got two sea view suites and they were perfect with a view to die for! Breakfast although busy was of a high standard. Room was spotless, beds comfy and balcony spacious with a bed to enjoy the incredible view. We did have an issue with the room but we were able to move to another room the next day with no fuss. Extra special thanks to Angeliki (Guest relations manager) for sorting this, being genuinely caring, smiley, helpful and ensuring the rest of our stay was problem free. Most of the staff were helpful, friendly and hard working. We were able to get sunbeds around the pool every day without needing to reserve them. Benitses is a great little town with a nice atmosphere and plenty of nice restaurants to eat in which we did on most nights. Fully recommend waking up for the sun rise and we would genuinely recommend this hotel for a luxury stay."
1/1/1111,50,Excellent resort with top facilities and very helpful staff,"Stayed with my family in August 2022. Cannot compliment the resort enough. Staff very helpful, facilities excellent (world class infinity pool) and rooms were spacious and well catered. We were well looked after by the Resort Manager (Ageliki) who was helpful from the beginning to the end of our stay. Would thoroughly recommend this place to any family. It is next to Bentises which is a small port town that offers a number of restaurants and activities and is only 1km away from the resort."
1/1/1111,50,Top resort in Corfu!,"After 11 times in Corfu this is the best resort.  Absolute cleanliness, the room was cleaned twice a day.  Resort curated in detail, suites with more space, staff always ready to be at the disposal of vacationers.  One of the few resorts where you see a happy working staff.  During most of our stay, we ate lunch in the resort Greek restaurant. Very good cooking, very good service.  I am surprised at the vacationers, not only in this resort but in general in Corfu and in Greece, who do not try the wonderful Greek cuisine, but order club sandwiches or hamburgers, pizza and pasta for lunch.  A resort that offers all the facilities, in the room, pool or beach.  I would come back again if I decided to spend my holidays in Corfu next year."
1/1/1111,20,Excellent location and great pool and gym but service and organization are a farce,"This hotel could be fantastic would the service and organization be at par with its great location and outdoor facilities. Actually very disappointing due to very pool service and customer care. Really not worth the money unless your main goal is to Instagram pool views.    We spent a vacation week in a see view suite.    The room was large and comfortable (as expected) but amenities are limited (only 1 large towel per guest, no sound system) and the sofa could not be used as it seems that a mattress was missing. Maybe used in an other room due to equipment shortage ?    The pool is great but no service at all in the pool area. Pool rules are not enforced (ball games for example) and very limited available space after 9am. Indigent service (for exemple : remainders of meals never get cleaned up on tables which means that wasps have to take care of it, which is somehow annoying for hotel guests !).    Very friendly staff generally speaking (special mention to one of the shuttle drivers who lives nearby and is super friendly and happy to teach the guests a few words of Greek during the short trip) but absolute lack of organization.    Do not expect your room to be taken care of in the morning on a daily basis. Rooms are sometimes cleaned up as late as 6pm. Night turn on service seems to be performed on a random basis.    Breakfast is at the expected level as regards food. Nothing fancy but at the expected level even if overall average. Big lines after 9am to get a table which means that you have to make a trade off between sleep time and comfortable breakfast.    At check out, make sure your final invoice is correct as we were wrongly invoiced 600 euros extra because Accor points that we used to pay a small part of the stay hadn’t been taken into consideration.    No recognition at all of Accor status.    Due to indigent service you feel like you are more in a kind of Airbnb or some youth hotel than in a 5* hotel."
1/1/1111,50,Gorgeous resort with fantastic staff!,"This resort is very beautiful. The setting is stunning, the views amazing, and it’s beautifully furnished. What stands out the most is the staff. They are consistently friendly, helpful and available. I particularly want to thank Alexandra for her massively warm welcome on arrival, and every time we saw her she asked how we were and how the holiday was going. And Peggy was fabulous at helping us book stuff, cancel stuff, recommendations and help whenever we needed it. Just outstanding.    It is close to benitses which is nice enough with some lovely restaurants. It’s about 40 mins by car to corfu old town which we ended up going back to several times because we loved it so much.    The beach is gorgeous, the food nice (although top tip, the simple, basic Greek food in the little taverna just next door is delicious). There is a regular shuttle to the beach driven by Harry who was fab.    The only slight issues we had were that there was very little for our kids to do (aged 10&11) so we went out a lot on day trips.    Our corner Ionian Sea view suite was great, although the glass door between our room and the room the kids were in made it a bit tricky at bed time as all lights had to be off!"
1/1/1111,50,Very good!,"Dear friends !  We recently stayed at your hotel and we liked everything.  I want to express my special gratitude to the manager Irina, who quickly organized everything we needed!  She is kind , talented and kind : once again many thanks to her !!"
1/1/1111,50,Excellent service - top notch facilities,"We booked a 2 bedroom Villa with a private pool. So far, Outstanding is the only way to describe our Villa and this resort.  Check in - private check in area that was seem less. Offered a nice towel to cool off as well as a welcome lemonade. Bags were immediately taken care of and whisked away.    Breakfast - I can’t imagine wanting anything else - everything was available - fresh and excellent quality.    Gym - wow! Enough said. Indoor lap pool 25m never have seen such facilities for a hotel.    Infinity pool - just lovely and the view is amazing. I haven’t tried to sit at the pool, not really my thing when there is a beautiful sea, however I did take a swim in the pool. Pool deck has a bar and it was crowded.    Vertigo Rooftop - what a view! Went up for cocktails. Excellent service and excellent drinks.    Room Service - extremely quick. Ordered salads - excellent quality.    Villa - 818 is nicely located - short walk to main hotel. Well appointed and extremely comfortable for 2 couples. Master suite on 2nd floor is fabulous - extremely large bath , tons of closet space. What more could a girl want!!    Private Beach - plenty of attendants assisting with loungers. Plenty of umbrellas. DJ playing nice music while we were there. Nice bar and again lots of servers for loungers.    Haven’t tried the restaurants yet as we have gone to Benitses each evening.    Benitses - cute village town with some good restaurants. Ate at MezzaVolta and Picante ( both reviewed separately) and both were excellent.  Parking is difficult. It would be a tough walk but can be done - maybe take shuttle to bottom???    Overall - excellent stay and highly recommend if staying in Corfu."
1/1/1111,50,Best service in a great hotel,"An exceptional vacation in a great hotel. The service by Konstantina ,Mara, Danai was outstanding. They took care of everything! And around the clock. The hotel is huge with several public areas and great restaurants. The view is ideal over the sea."
1/1/1111,50,Just Brilliant !!,"We had a wonderful week with my family of 5 - my wife travels for work and she said this was one of the best.  The Head of Guest Services Angeliki was brilliant and when did a couple of issues she sorted and went above and beyond. Awesome POOL, service and Food! Will go BACK!"
1/1/1111,50,Great time!,"We had a very fun time at this hotel! The amazing views, genuine people and classes, helps you overcome the crowdedness that is a bit of a chaotic frenzy of kids and people clamoring for sun beds! This is not the hotels fault just a heads up, but don’t let this deter you from absolutely loving the Angsana and Corfu! I loved all the events, classes and restaurants in-house and at the beach. What sealed the deal is Mamadou, the man at the beach from Guinea/Sierra Leone. He will move the umbrella so the sun is not in your face, scours to find you the best chair, rolls out your towels and cleans up when people leave all in the hot sun with a big smile. He literally shakes the hands of kids, brings you cold water before you ask for it. He should be the General Manager of operations for the pool and beach! Then there is Akis, Elena and Nana, lovely bartenders and servers! Milkiares and Ana that are at the events and are adorable. Alexandra also took great care of me and my mother!    This place is truly an awesome experience.    Courtney and Alysa Katz"
1/1/1111,10,Worst hotel I have ever been! Don’t be impressed from the website pictures!,"Absolutely ridiculous, I have never wasted money in an hotel like this! As I arrived, children and people of every kind were running and shouting in the middle of the entrance/reception, then I had lunch sitting close to people dressing with just a swimsuit at the table, then we went into the bedroom passing trough a long tight corridor like in a jail, we got into the room, very dark, next I moved to the balcony that was surrounded by two oppressing walls, and it was like being in a parking lot, no tranquillity at all, just the noises of cars coming and leaving, people talking under us, then we went to the beach too small for all the guests and I found out that for the Stand up paddle (SUP is usually free everywhere) they will charge 30€ per hour. And I can finish with the very expensive dinner at their fusion restaurant! I can’t wait to come back home, just other two more awful days in this uncomfortable’resort’."
1/1/1111,50,"Great Experience! Wonderful location, facilities and staff.","The rooms are modern and clean most of the hotel is having a sea view, as the hotel is on the top of the hill(view amazing)... After a long day it's you will be happy to return in such rooms and wake up again with the beautiful view. Method of how the cleaning service is functioning very comlicated(change it). The beach is nice , private, nice water, fair amount of space as it's the private beach of the hotel. You will have a very pleasant server Elena(fast and pleasent even though it's 36°. The only issue at the beach is that the food menu is limited(You need more stuff on the menu). Regarding the other restaurants the staff is giving their best to serve you in the best possible way, kind, respectful and easing it as much as possible for you during your meal. Same issue with the menu, more dishes needed. In regards to the wine and strong bevragelist, the sommelier should re-consider his choice(still you will find what you need). Wonderful concierge service making sure that your day is fur filled, lots of tours can be organized via the concierge service and they will make sure that you have all the necceseties while outside the hotel (rent a car, boats, tours... Without having many complications) example:Chris rent a car, full insured car with a small page to sign for a fair price, giving the car with a smile and taking it back. The concierge should think about of renting a boat to bring the guests of the hotel to Palokastristsa, as the beach there have a wonderful water but the beaches are packed, with the boat the water will be enyoed without the crowd. All in all everything was so well organized by Mrs. Irena Tsikinodu, that I haven't felt any stress or complications regarding the visit. Thanks Irena! Thanks to the Agnasana team and see you next year."
1/1/1111,20,Views and Queues,"Bitterly disappointed. Our fault for not checking that “family friendly” meant crèche. Hundreds of screaming kids get the run of all areas. The only thing here that is 5 star is the view. Could not get anything to eat on day of arrival apart from room service, which in my experience is a yardstick by which all hotel food can be judged. Tasteless, cold and unseasoned. A burger so dry (and I suspect microwaved). Breakfast is shoddy, coffee is cold and children allowed to touch pick up and put down food at will that other guests are allowed to eat. Can’t echo the “Carling” comments above enough regarding bed holding around the pool. It enough loungers. Kids allowed with large inflatables in every section of the pool. The adult only rooftop is welcome reprise but a request for a simple margarita is met with an alternative of a giant ice cube in a glass of tequila. We have 4 nights to go and want to check out. The staff are young and inexperienced and have no concept of what 5 star service is. The room is huge and the view spectacular however it lacks real luxury touches. The mini bar is not stocked, the toiletries (under the guise of eco friendly) come in ceramic jars are difficult to handle especially in the bath, only one towel per person. There is no atmosphere in the evenings, I suspect all the families are tucked up in bed by 9 with young children. The reception area is very unimpressive, there are no fresh flowers, plants or luxury touches. This is utility grade mass produced concept architecture and interior design. The public areas remind me of airport lounges or corporate offices. So overall if you want your toddlers to have fun whilst still retaining a semblance of what life was like before them this is your place. If you are seasoned travellers, used to getting considerably more for your £1000 a night absolutely don’t bother."
1/1/1111,20,Disappointing,"We were expecting 5 star Asian style service and food, couldn’t have been more wrong. The hotel has great views, spacious beautifully appointed suites, modern facilities yet no management to run the place. Staff are disorganised from housekeeping to restaurants, expect to ask several times for anything from pool, to room service to house keeping, to water and wait and wait and wait…  For those with walking difficulties be mindful of beach, access is via shuttle which is mostly over crowded and infrequent for number of guests. Oh and no benches to sit on while waiting for it in the scorching sun, Try sitting inside in the lobby but the time the shuttle arrives those waiting outside will have pushed their way in.  Also like many others who mentioned this before, there are not enough sun loungers at beach or pool. For a luxury hotel this is very poor service.  But above all in 2022, a hotel such as Angsana member of Accor hotels still uses plastic - tonnes of plastic actually - water bottles provided are ALL plastic everywhere - in room to pool to restaurants. This is not acceptable. Oh and the beach shuttle is a van, with proper carbon emissions. Why not use electric vehicles ??  Food and drinks menu are also limited at beach and pool, after a couple of days becomes very boring. Especially if you have to wait and wait for your order. Beach service is actually the only decent one.  Cocktails are mostly overpriced and Koh charges 20 euros for 2 nigiris or sashimis. Does this even need a comment ? In a country where fresh fish abounds.  Overall very disappointing and will not come back."
1/1/1111,50,A breath of fresh air for Corfu!,"We visited Angsana in Corfu for a long weekend at the end of July,  The venue was a great blend of modern –really well matched-with elements of Kerkira’s identity.    The latter was mirrored perfectly in the traditional dishes with a twist served in Sofrito restaurant but mainly in the hospitality spirit and uplifting energy of the employees!    We felt welcomed and looked after from the minute Alexandra greeted us at the hotel entrance on our arrival. Her genuine interest in understanding our needs, combined with warmth and effectiveness, resulted in personalising our stay in ways that made it memorable for the years to come.  The boat trip to paxos/antipaxos/sivota was a thrilling experience.    The rooms were decent size for what it usually is and the infinity pool pretty extraordinary (although it could get busy at times)    We will come back!"
1/1/1111,30,Champagne prices with beer service,"A Conde Nast recommended hotel - that’s why we chose it . Be warned the staff are clearly not aware they are expected to provide five star service . The design of the hotel is very cool so perhaps the Conde Nast writer was taken in by the design / appearance . Well there is a lot more to a hotel then white billowy curtains on a cabana !  We booked two rooms , only one was ready when we arrived at 3.05pm - we were given a very long tour of the facilities which was clearly to mask the fact our room was not ready - eventually at 5.30 pm we were told we could go to the rooms .  The standard no view rooms are dark and look onto a service road and some poor landscaping - best to spend the extra to get a sea view .  There are several restaurants on the premises , the best by far is the 1 star Michelin Botrini’s - Both for service and quality of food .The breakfast restaurant is staffed by lovely young very inexperienced staff , who are not really sure why anyone would want a ‘hot ‘ latte !  The best part of the Hotel is the Spa and gym  Area with lap pool . Here the staff are exceptional and all the treatments are worth every Euro .  The front of house staff have slick responses and are very mechanical , don’t ask for anything tricky that’s not on their stock response script !  The beach area is well looked after and the staff are very accommodating and want to make your day special - it’s so heart warming to see a small child hug a member of staff and say how they will miss them .  However , the same cannot be said for the outdoor pool area , the staff have a huge problem with the number of guests versus the number of sun beds ! The Carling black label add comes to mind ! If you are not in the habit of getting up early , trekking down to the pool area , carting bits of holiday ‘stuff ‘ with you to bag beds - at 8am - this hotel is not for you ! The pool staff try their very best but are met with many disgruntled guests , especially when the early birds don’t turn up all day to lie on the beds they so carefully saved with a flip flop or two !  Overall the hotel is fine , but I would only give it Four stars . Would I come back ?  No I would want to try one of the other resorts first .  Happy Holidays!"
1/1/1111,50,Excellent holiday in Angsana Corfu,"We have spent one week excellent holiday in Angsana Corfu. We really enjoyed it! The view from the infinity pool is amazing and WOW!! The restaurant Botrini’s is top. The restaurant Sofrito is very good as well. We had a drink in Vertigo rooftop bar, the 360 view is so beautiful…We also tried the Greek dance with the gym trainer. We had a lot of fun on that.    All the staff we met are professional, friendly and helpful. Thank you all. Well done!  We would like to express our special Thank to Irene. She gave us very good suggestions on the places to visit in Corfu island, and she also helped us book a boat trip to Island Paxos and Antipaxos. Irene’s hospitality and kindness made our holiday in Corfu awesome."
1/1/1111,40,Great facilities but some niggles,"The facilities were great. We enjoyed the infinity pool, private beach and the gym. We found the food to be average or below. We tried lunch at the hotel and a number of things didn’t arrive or were cold when they did. This was when the restaurant was pretty empty. After that we found much better restaurants in Benitses. The breakfast was fine but many of the staff at breakfast genuinely looked very unhappy / suicidal. I wonder what is going wrong that the workers seemed so unhappy. Outside of the hotel most people we came across were really lovely and friendly. We would come back to Angsana for the facilities but our expectations of food and service there are low."
1/1/1111,50,Lovely stay thanks to incredible service: thank you Katia and Theotokis!,"My husband and I stayed at Angsana for 3 incredible nights - we had a spectacular room, the food was delicious and I particularly appreciated the VIP treatment from Katia who arranged many wonderful activities and really went out her way to make sure we go to explore and see the best of Corfu! Theotokis was very helpful and accommodating. We will come back!"
1/1/1111,50,Evrything was perfect! And concerned for the little details,"The hotel and service exstra ordinary! We had an perfect experience❤️  The rooms were clean, the food was great.  The hotel was very clean.  The crew is concerned with amemorable experience.  It certainly left taste of more.  Orly&doron yamin.."
1/1/1111,40,Very good but not flawless experience,"Visited Angsana with my wife on a 10-day retreat. Overall, it is a very good accomodation with some minor flaws when it comes to hotel service.    ""+"":  - Location - be ready to be amazed by views!  - Sports - spacious gym, sport pool and lots of sports activities with great trainers free of charge (we really enjoyed our yoga classes and TRX!)  - Top Concierge service - we were especially impressed by Irene, who helped us to arrange fantastic boat trips to Paxos & Corfu Town, was really caring and provided lots of helpful recommendations. Everything was perfect!  - SPA - very relaxing treatments with very professional reception staff & therapists  - Cozy beach with crystal clear water and engaged personnel  - Some additional activities like boats for rent, hiking, a village with cosy tavernas within walking distance, 10km from Corfu town  - Excellent breakfast with variety of Greek delicacies    ""-"":  - The pool is not a ""five star"" experience at all - people ""book"" sunbeds with towels in early morning and then show up after breakfast. The only way to get a sunbed is to play the same game. We really sympathized the staff who was very attentive and still tried to help everyone to find a place. Why wouldn't the hotel management just explicitly ban this improper behaviour?  - Corfu is a green island, but nothing can explain a prevalence of wasps and ants in the hotel. When 3 wasps try to get into you salmon teriyaki you may not want to enjoy the view...  - Some minor, but annoying mismanagement - you order black greek coffee and get caffe latte, you order a taxi and it never arrives, you ask for room service to come back in 30 mins and they forget, you wait for the beach transfer and it doesn't come on time...The stuff is very friendly and eager to resolve the issues, but it seems that they have difficulties to manage the scale of operations  - Quite limited choice of non-alcoholic drinks, would be great to add some ""freshly made"" ice teas, lemonades, cocktails (not only bottled sodas & virgin mojito)"
1/1/1111,50,Unique experience in one of the most special hote,"They had recommended this hotel to me as one of the best in Corfu...  Having traveled quite a lot for work, I am always wary of such characterizations...however I was happy to find that this time it is fully justified, the rooms are excellent with the small luxurious details showing how much care the owners have put into it. ..the staff with a highly professional and at the same time very friendly attitude...the location is completely practical, however what will stay with me was the last evening..having a drink in the Vertigo roof garden with a light evening breeze and extremely relaxing music looking at the sea from above...unforgettable Greek summer for me and my family."
1/1/1111,50,Unbelievable experience!!,"Excellent service from the moment you arrive at the hotel you feel safe at the gate we said our name and they were waiting for us. They sent us to the reception, took down our bags and parked the car. Fantastic room with a view of the beautiful sea, very spacious and bright, immediate service from the room service. Vertigo incredible spot for our drink at the top of the hotel incredible pleasure. The best place to relax I highly recommend it"
1/1/1111,50,Fabulous stay!,"We have immensely enjoyed our stay at the hotel! Great service, beautiful pool, attentive staff. Definitely the place to be in the summer with or without kids.  We loved the Emerald beach, which offers great water activities and the bar menu is great. You can easily spend all day on the beach.  Very good facilities overall. The staff will definitely walk that extra mile to make your stay comfortable."
1/1/1111,50,A memorable experience,"An outstanding resort, well positioned and incredibly high standard. Staff was amaizingly trained and client oriented, services at the highest level. A Michelin Chef and good restaurants. The views and infinity pool made the experience memorable. Chapeau!"
1/1/1111,50,Best hotel in Corfu!!,"Not the first time in Corfu as we love the island with my husband. The hotel opened last year and since we stayed in other Banyan Tree hotels we thought to try this time that one.  Everything look new as they should and with style. Very impressive entrance, not to mention the views... You really feel that you have arrived in a 5* hotel. Wins by the arrival.  Hotel was full as we have been told and hence was busy. There are many dining options and bars to have a drink, would definitely recommend to visit The Vertigo Cocktail Bar on roof top , but we enjoyed as well equally the Asian restaurant and Sofrito, the greek one.  Breakfast buffet was at main restaurant so visit it at our first day. We did enjoy it as we had all we needed and plenty food options too. The 2nd day onward we followed the advise on the TV to visit prior 9am and it was indeed very very smooth and nice experience.  Hotel has an amazing infinity pool and a private beach. We enjoyed twice our day at pool even though its difficult to find but there is no way the guys there will not offer you an option. The team was friendly and attentive and we could order any time we wanted anytjing by pressing our buzzer on the umbrella. Service on the beach was also great and quick. More relaxed and I would call it a hidden jem of the hotel.  Rooms are spacious and well equipped, bright with the most comfortable bed ever!  The Spa experience was up and beyond. I tried the full body massage and facial treatment.    Angsana will see you in 2 years again for sure ."
1/1/1111,30,Great hotel but the service is not quite there,"Hotel is beautiful to look at and holds great facilities. Sofrito food was delicious and pool area was great but pool snack menu is very limited    However the service provided during our stay was not good enough. From being put in a room not fit for purpose and not being able to move until late the following day, having a birthday cake brought to our room at 11:30pm at night and constantly having to repeat yourself 3-4 times for things to be done correctly this does become tiresome and put us off eating at the hotel on multiple occasions.    Was definitely put off using room service as it took around 2 hours to get our order right and it was as simple as a burger with no sauce.    The reception staff didn’t bother to go extra way for you when mistakes were made which managers were aware of    People get up around half 7 to reserve sunbeds so don’t expect many to be free after 8am    It’s difficult to get a taxi from the hotel so try and pre book if you can - its 20 euro return trip to benitses and 70-70 euro return trip to corfu town    Would really recommend to the hotel to pick up on the service and it would be an unreal hotel."
1/1/1111,40,Beautiful hotel but overpriced food and drinks!!!!,"Absolutely bliss BUT food and drinks are massively overpriced!!!!!    Me and my husband stayed here in June for 6 nights. Loved every second of it but unfortunately our bank account DIDNT!    The pros: It is a stunning hotel in a stunning location, very close to Corfu airport (about 20 mins drive), close to Corfu Old Town. The views from the hotel are breathtaking. Truly is a 5 star hotel. The rooms are very spacious, cleaned throughout the day, fresh towels are always available. The staff are extremely professional and welcoming, nothing is a problem for them. The hotel has a beautiful spa, highly recommend to try it out. Breakfast is same every day but very fresh and delicious, plenty to choose from and various coffee options are available too. Recommend to try out the Michelin star restaurant on the first floor, absolutely beautiful food, pricey but worth it! The hotel has also a rooftop bar open late night with stunning views, specially for sunset you must book (same for every restaurant in the hotel apart for lunch).  We had the most relaxing holiday in ages….    The cons: Extremely overpriced food (a chicken burger with fries €24, a turkey ham wrap with side salad €18, mushroom risotto €24). These are just few examples and unfortunately none of them blow me away! They were average (I’m a chef)! Not much options to choose from for lunch, burger, chicken burger, Turkey ham wrap and one vegan option if I good remember. This is an every day menu and it get pretty boring very quickly. Same for dinner! Noodles, burgers, risotto….. again overpriced and I can’t say that they tasted anything special….  Unfortunately I can’t review the drinks any better, regardless of how qualified is the barman it shouldn’t cost €24-28 for a gin tonic cocktail or any alcoholic drink really, it is a rip off in my opinion and going through previous reviews I think many people agree on that! You must lower your prices, change the menu!    Regarding restaurants nearby I highly recommend to go to the nearest little village which is 10 mins walk from the main road (hotel is on the hill and you have to walk it down which can take up to 15 mins and it is very steep/again they should have a shuttle service for this), very well priced and delicious homemade food, fresh, plenty of restaurants to choose from. We went there twice for dinner on the last 2 nights and I wish we had have done it from the beginning!!!!!    The beach is very close, they run a shuttle service from 10 am-5 pm, I would recommend to do that rather than walk it as it is very steep and can be difficult to walk it in the heat.    Taxis are again expensive €45 from the hotel to Corfu Old Town, €10 to the nearest village (10 mins walk) one way…    Overall we had a lovely time but compared to other 5star hotel we visited we found Angsana hugely overpriced for this reason we won’t return!"
1/1/1111,50,AC,"We spent 6 nights at Angsana in 2 rooms and loved it. The property is beautiful and the food was great, especially Koh restaurant with its sweeping views. The beach is fabulous - great service and water sports to keep everyone happy and entertained. Alexandra is a particularly stellar concierge who is dialed in to everything from restaurants to boating excursions."
1/1/1111,40,Best views!!!!,"Just came back from a family holiday to Corfu. We stayed at this hotel. The views are amazing. It’s a lovely hotel. We stayed 6days in 2rooms, one for my boys and a room for my husband and I.    Food: would have loved more choice at the hotel although the food at the 2 restaurants we ate at were delicious, we got tired of them quite quickly. There are a few restaurants outside the hotel you can go to though which are not as pricey.    Activities: Katia at guest services was amazing, she suggested the boat trip and restaurants outside the hotel. Both were amazing.    Rooms: The rooms were good. My only complaint with this hotel is with housekeeping, they could have done a better job with cleaning the rooms especially with covid.    Facilities: The beach is amazing with its water sports, my boys and I went jet skiing with Castos. We loved it. The swimming pool has the best views I have ever seen… honestly stay here for the views alone. People do wake up early to keep sunbeds but we never had an issue with securing 4 beds no matter the time we got there. The pool staff know which beds have been unused for awhile and just remove any towels/books/hats that have been used to hold the beds.    Spa: one word AMAZING. My husband, my sons and I all had the best massages ever.    I would say we had an amazing time at this hotel and will definitely be back."
1/1/1111,50,First time visitors to Corfu,"We found Angsana to be the (almost) perfect place to stay during our week on the island. On arrival we were greeted with a room upgrade which gave us a fabulous sea view. Facilities are excellent, particularly the beautiful Spa. The staff are very friendly and super helpful particularly Angeliki and Irene who gave us some fabulous recommendations, thank you!  The only disappointment was Koh, the Asian restaurant inside the hotel which doubles as the sunrise pool bar during the day, this is overpriced and lacking any kind of ambience, we had a better meal for less money in the michelin starred Botrinis.  Would definitely return and highly recommend."
1/1/1111,50,Fantastic stay at Angsana,"It was my first time staying in Corfu, and Angsana has made my trip outstanding. The hotel itself is beautfiul and the views are perfect.    The staff have been very helpful, and I’d like to highlight Luca in particular. He has been very kind and helpful to me and my family."
1/1/1111,30,Beautiful hotel. Staff need training,"Hotel has potential but it lets itself down.  Positives: kids club and kids club staff are AMAZING!! My children absolutely loved it. The staff try really hard with them and they would leave every day with fantastic art creations. My children also really enjoyed the swimming lessons and the teacher was fantastic.  Pool staff work really hard and try their best.  Rooms are lovely spacious and amazing views.  Breakfast excellent quality.  Lovely swimming pool.  Gym and indoor pool are excellent.    Negatives: poorly trained staff in the restaurants. Who is the restaurant manager? He/she is doing a terrible job!!! Breakfast is chaos! Dirty tables being left dirty and no one tidying them up, whilst queues of people are waiting for tables. To be told ‘we are busy you will have to wait’ Is not good enough for a 5 star hotel. You know how many guests you have so the hotel should be better prepared. It really isn’t the guest’s problem if the hotel is busy. Similar issues with lunch, restaurant not busy but service painfully slow but then are members of staff just standing around not doing anything. A glass smashed on the floor and it took a good 5 minutes for anyone to do anything and there are children walking around.  Other major issue is not enough sunloungers. All gone by 8am but no one on them. Again for a 5 star hotel this is not good enough. Hotel needs more sun loungers, there is space for more.  We did have a brilliant time but the hotel has to sort these issues out as it’s off putting for such a beautiful hotel."
1/1/1111,50,"Great experience, will definitely be returning","I had the pleasure of staying at Angsana for 2 nights with my family, and I will definitely be returning.    When we arrived, we were welcomed by Thanasis, who was very helpful with taking our many bags to and from our room. During our stay we went on a small boat trip and I would like to thank Luca from guest relations, who was very helpful with organizing the rental.    The amenities at the resort were all amazing. I loved spending time at the pool and seeing the beautiful view, and I also utilized the gym, where I had a very good workout led by Antonis, one of the trainers. The food was great and going up to Vertigo, the rooftop bar, was gorgeous and very relaxing.    Overall, I had an excellent time at Angsana Corfu and will it will definitely be my first choice the next time I visit Greece."
1/1/1111,40,Great stay. Loved renting the eBikes.,"We spent 4 nights after a 7 day cruise in the Aegean islands. Hotel is a quick cab ride from airport. Highlights are the infinity pool overlooking the ocean and well appointed rooms. The hotel provides ebikes from a third party and we spent two days touring the island on the bikes. The breakfast buffet is fantastic with a great variety of choices. I loved the fresh tomato juice and cheeses. There is a deck outside gym also overlooking the gym and I had Pilates and yoga each evening. Instructor was wonderful, wish I wrote down her name so I could give credit.    After reading the other reviews I will have to agree that the staff could use some training in customer service. Servers at the breakfast buffet don’t anticipate your needs and we had to flag them down to get water and coffee. I had a solo dinner at Koh one night and I had to request that some one take my order twice. Just seemed like a lack of training that could easily be remedied. Another odd thing was getting a knock on the door at 10:30 pm from housekeeping to turn down the bed. My husband had to get up from bed to tell them to go away. Despite this I would still recommend this hotel to others, but would suggest you have your dinners in the nearby town or take a taxi or speed boat into old town where there are many fine restaurants."
1/1/1111,30,Teething problems,"An impressive new hotel with a curved infinity pool overlooking a stunning sea view. The rooms are decent, mostly well thought out, but tv and media technology quite basic for a new hotel. No Netflix etc. The food is excellent. What really lets this hotel down is the staff. Poor attitude and lack of attention to detail with one or two notable exceptions. They are not yet working as a team and seem to lack direction and general management. Talking of which, the General Manager is invisible and completely unavailable to hotel guests. At full occupancy there are insufficient sun loungers for all guests, and restaurants get fully booked. The latter is surprising; there are ample tables, the problem seems to be lack of kitchen capacity. Housekeeping is slow and rooms should really be ready when checking in at 3.30pm. Lost luggage - total incompetence - did not improve the check in experience and guest relations staff totally disinterested and give the general impression of utter boredom. This hotel is crying out for some proper management. It’s a shame; this hotel could and should be much better."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing!,"Hands down best hotel on the island. Vertigo Sky Bar and the Angsana Spa are a must! The views of the Ionian are breathtaking and it was fabulous to see the moonrise right in front of my suite every night. And last, the Fitness Center is like a Gold’s Gym… WOW."
1/1/1111,50,The best hotel in Corfu,"This hotel is one of the best I’ve stayed at and the facilities were great. A special thank you to Luca and Alexandra at reception. They were both really helpful and kind.    The rooms are very clean and the staff were very helpful. I will definitely be visiting again.    When I did have an issue and made reception aware, it was dealt with professionally and I was compensated generously as well. The stay was 5 star throughout and have recommended this hotel to friends and family."
1/1/1111,50,Family vacation,Angasana is a beautiful resort  We booked a ionian seafacing junior suite  We checked in really late at night because of  Flight delays.Check in was very professional and the gentleman who checked us in showed us around and informed us where all the restaurants were etc  We were really hungry when we checked in but unfortunately the room service is not available 24 hours but the team left some cheese and fruit on arrival in our room.we were celebrating our anniversary and a special thank you to Anggeliki who had organised a nice chilled bottle of champagne 🍾 and chocolates in our room she is such a star.Our room was spectacular and beautiful with all the amenities you would need.We had booked half board not realising that the main buffet restaurant was shut so had to eat at sofarito al carte and the Asian restaurant Koh.Food was amazing but got bored of the menu after a week as we staryed for 11 nights. Choices for vegetarian at koh were very limited. We also had Sunday brunch on our stay which was very disappointing as there was hardly any Choices for vegetarian I would not recommend the brunch for the price we travel a lot around the world and the brunch Choices here are not good.  The only negative thing we had was the service in the restaurant and at breakfast. The staff need to be trained for service they looked very unenthusiastic and unhappy especially at breakfast when you ordered your coffee and never arrived and had to ask at least three times. The manager needs a good training session with the staff for sure.The roof top bar was always empty and hostess always asked if we had a reservation when it was all empty apart from influencer's taking all the good tables drinks were super expensive but very good mixology. Poolside lunch was good if you got it on time .Overall after all the negatives it was an excellent vacation and really recommended this resort but don't go half board. Shame that the restaurant staff ruin it for the excellent chefs who provided beautiful food .Team work will make this resort a lot better  Thank you Angsana 😊
1/1/1111,50,Fantastic stay,"From the moment we arrived at this hotel we were warmly welcomed by the staff there and the experience overall was incredible. We stayed at the Angsana for 7 nights - the hotel is absolutely stunning, our room was beautiful, spotless clean and the view was breathtaking. The staff were so hospitable and went out of their way to help us. Our guest relations manager Angeliki was kind and super helpful. I would love to come back to this hotel!"
1/1/1111,50,Awesome stay,"Just stayed at the Angsana with my family, and it was an amazing experience. Angeliki and the rest of the team were phenomenal, and ensured we had an unforgettable trip. Everyone was so nice and friendly, and no detail was overlooked. If you are looking for a modern, luxurious hotel with great service in Corfu, this is it. One of the best hotels in all of Greece!"
1/1/1111,50,Anniversary,"It was a wonderful vacation, breathtaking view and most kindly stuff especially Lilian that helped us alot.  We absolutely come back there in the future.  One of the most beautiful hotels in europe!  Enjoy"
1/1/1111,30,Amazing hotel facility - lacks 5 star service,"This is a very impressive hotel resort. Beautiful facilities. Everything brand new. Stunning views of the bay. Great infinity pool. We stayed in a lovely corner view suite. What let’s the place down is the service. I’ve stayed at the Banyan Tree group hotels before in Asia and the service is impeccable. It’s one of the reasons I chose this resort. However, Angsana Corfu has just not got the service right. They’ve not been able to translate the high level of service from their parent group into this hotel. I consistently found myself asking for basic things 3 and 4 times. This was not an isolated incident. The staff also appear disorganized. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. The facilities are without question 5 star - unfortunately the service provided by the staff is far from it."
1/1/1111,50,Best resort and spa out there in Corfu!,"The service was great, the restaurants which are located in the resort were spectacular. And of course, the villas were spacious with your own private pool. Everything was taken care off, our car was taken by the receptionist worker to the parking garage, our luggages were brought by straight to our accommodation within 15 minutes we received all our luggages. Every single worker that works there is so kind and respectful, the resort itself is wonderful, definitely worth a visit! And shout out to the the villa administrator/manager, she was so pleasant, always checked in with us if everything is okay during our stay and recommended us the best places to visit and try Greek food. Loved our stay in this resort & we were told that we were the first Lithuanians that visited this resort:D"
1/1/1111,50,Unforgettable stay @ Angsana Corfu,"Last week, we spent our holidays @ Angsana Corfu Resort.  It was an unforgettable experience, the infinity pool and mountain views were of an unseen beauty.  Not to mention the outstanding private & personal service by two lovely ladies, Mara & Konstantina, a big thank you for having pampered us throughout our whole holiday at any time!  We can't wait to get to Angsana Corfu next Summer! A totally luxurious heaven on earth place to stay!"
1/1/1111,50,A lovely 5 star experience,"The hotel staff have customer service down to a fine art. The guys who drive the bus to the beach and back are really fab and are so helpful and friendly. Irene the customer service manager is superb and really can't do enough for you. Breakfast is buffet style and caters very well for everyone. There is lots of choice of fresh fruit and then there is a cooked breakfast area. The walk into town takes 20 mins and isn't a hard walk BUT it's quite steep coming back and dark at night so get a cab! As a treat get a speed boat into Corfu Town, go for dinner and then get the boat back. The hotel will arrange it and it's well worth it!"
1/1/1111,50,"Beautiful, quality hotel with fantastic food","The hotel has the extra zip of being brand new, with quality fittings and furnishings used throughout, from public rooms, to guest rooms, breakfast areas and restaurants.    Everything is beautifully done.    We found the staff almost uniformly professional, polite and helpful.    We were half board and found the food outstanding. Particularly in the sofritos restaurant, but also the breakfast offerings. Amongst the best I've had, including top restaurant settings.    I'd also like to express my thanks for the late checkout provided which helped us a lot with high temperatures and a later flight home.    The prices are high (for the average traveller) and I did find this seemed to limit the amount of wine and cocktails being consumed (11 eur min for a glass of wine, 18 eur min for a cocktail) and probably reduced attendance at the rooftop bar as well. I'm no economist, but suggest some slightly lower price offerings would improve the guest experience, and bring in more revenue...    All in all, a memorial experience.    Ps i would also recommend dropping into benitses and supporting some of the quality local businesses operating down there!"
1/1/1111,50,Amazing 14day Honeymoon,"We returned home at the weekend from a 14day fantastic honeymoon at Angsana. The resort is somehow even better than the pictures! Having spent 14days here, we can truly review everything including the villas and the hotel rooms so here goes….    Overall:  The views are breathtaking and the staff are so welcoming and friendly. Having travelled to many countries and stayed in some lovely hotels, it has to be said that is the best hotel we have stayed in.    Rooms:  We spent half our honeymoon in a villa and half in the main hotel, so we experienced the best of both worlds.  The villa was so peaceful and spacious and it really made you feel relaxed with your own pool and balcony to chill on. It was only ever a short walk or lift (if a golf buggy happened to be passing you) to the main hotel so it was never far to walk. As part of the villa, you also get drinks and canapés in the evening in the villa lounge within the hotel which was a really nice touch and gave you time to relax and take in the views from a perfect spot outside at the hotel and a little bite to eat and drink before dinner.    One lady in particular really made our stay that bit more special - Konstantina, the villa manager. The welcoming, the smiles every time we saw one another, the attention, the making sure everything was great, she is just lovely and a really big asset to the resort.    The Seaview suite - firstly a sea view room is a must! The room was just lovely, the bath was amazing and the view was spectacular. Really big pluses of the room were the bed - it’s so big and ridiculously comfortable, the bath - you could get lost in it! The balcony was just great, gave you peace and quiet and the bed outside really allowed you to relax whilst taking in the view.    Now the question you all have is - villa or hotel!? Right? Well I have to say that both were amazing and it really depends what you are looking for from the resort. I would say the villa is amazing as it gives you the peace and quiet, space and private pool to just relax with each other and it’s not far from the main hotel at all. The Seaview suite - was also amazing with the bigger views, the balcony overlooking the hotel/pool, closer to the restaurants and you didn’t have any fear of missing out as you were in the heart of the action. So it really gets down to personal preference.    Food and Drinks:  We are still dreaming about the breakfast buffet! It was SO good! It really sets you up for the day as there is an amazing amount of choice. We found it was best to go before 9am as after that it can get quite busy. The made to order coffee is a nice feature and the brownies are the best we’ve ever tasted.    Sunday Brunch: Since we were here for two weeks we did Sunday Brunch twice! There are appetisers and desserts etc at the buffet but you can also order items from the menu. We tried most of the items and they were all very tasty!    Dinner: we tried each restaurant 2+ times so we have a good experience of them.    Koh - good choice and delicious large portioned Asian food.    Soffrito - also delicious and lots of choice. The fish dishes were fresh and tasty and the chips were crispy and fluffy.    Botrini’s - well this was just great. They really made you feel special here. The servers were very attentive and the food was so inventive and different yet delicious. Definitely a must try for a fine dining experience.    The Vertigo Sky bar, which is not long opened was amazing. There was various live music on, the service was great and the cocktails were even better! I’ve never tasted such a good pina colada!    The Private Beach - this is a must! Many sun loungers with parasols to choose from and a great service too with towels and water on ice when you arrive. The sea was even warm! The cocktails were lovely and just what you need on a hot day.    Other things to note:  There is a shuttle bus to their private beach and back every 30min. There are also two shuttles and back to Benitses in the evening. Both extremely helpful, as we did attempt the walk from the beach back to the hotel a couple of times and in the heat and flip flops is a small challenge.    We hired a car for a day which the hotel organised after we picked what vehicle we wanted from their car hire options which allowed us to see more of the island. The car was dropped off and picked up at the hotel for us which was so convenient. Also, whenever you drove the car to the hotel, you just stopped it outside and someone from the hotel would drive it into the car park for you and then when you required the car, someone would go and pick it up and bring it to the front of the hotel, which was great! Irene from Guest Relations was so helpful throughout our stay with anything from restaurant bookings to helping us pick out the best spots to visit and where to see the sunset etc.    It was a truly memorable Honeymoon experience and can’t wait to visit again."
1/1/1111,50,Stunning hotel and wonderful staff,"We stayed at Angsana Corfu for one week. We had a fabulous time and enjoyed it thoroughly. From the moment we arrived it felt like paradise. We got greeted with a personal assistant who did the check in with us while seated. We received a cold towel and a bracelet as a welcome present. We booked the Ionian Seaview room and we enjoyed the half board food which was constantly at high quality and very tasty. We also visited the gym and had two classes with Antonis - he did a great job, took great care of us and his classes were very individual and empowering! All the staff was extremely friendly and service oriented. The hotel has its own beach and there is a transfer offered to and from there. The housekeepers not only cleaned the rooms very precisely, but also left an individual touch every evening with a turn down service in which we were greeted in the room by a scented lamp, some nougat and a Corfiot historical information. Also water was filled up in the room twice daily! Very impressive service!    As everything was very satisfying, I don’t want to highlight minor negative topics too much, but of course mention these as a feedback for the hotel management. What we noticed was the menu for the restaurant that was the same for lunch and dinner all week. Maybe daily specials could be added to offer a little more variety. Although we were happy to have bottled water filled up constantly, the bottles were plastic bottles and therefore not very environmentally friendly. This could be solved by glass bottles or other reusable options.    Last point: the hotel is not located easily accessible as of infrastructure. You need a car or motor cycle (you can park free of charge on several parking spaces or use the valet parking service) to move around, otherwise you can only take a good walk to the centre of Benitses with the Marina (not very easy to walk as the paths are almost not existing and/or in a bad condition) and apart from a few restaurants, a supermarket and souvenir shop not much to see. Corfu city is about 25 minutes away by car.    Thanks to the staff for making this stay so special and memorable!"
1/1/1111,50,Enjoyed every moment of our stay in this hotel,"The hotel is exceptional, very well kept and clean. I also want to say compliments to its designers. But the best thing of angsana hotel is the staff, they are very friendly, kind and always smiling.  It has great views, pools and bars. The Vertigo bar is really nice too, it has really barmen - Zafiris and Jason - very attentive to customers and very detail - oriented. Absolutely recommended to have their cocktails at Vertigo.  We had fabulous time in Angsana thanks to the staff."
1/1/1111,30,Holding Deposit Refund,"Have still not received Check in Holding Deposit refund of over £500, a month after checking out. Was told would be refunded 3-5 working days after check out. Such a shame as we had a relatively good experience otherwise. Apart from service around the Pool could be quicker."
1/1/1111,50,Get me back now…,Absolutely loved this hotel. From check in to checkout the service was top notch. The rooms are spacious and views spectacular. Buffet breakfast was yuge and Botrinis a must experience. Chatted with a very nice fellow wearing a Lions Not Sheep cap who happened to be the owner.
1/1/1111,50,Simply brilliant,"My family and I have just come home from such a wonderful stay at Angsana. The resort is truly exceptional, the views are breathtaking and you feel like you have stepped into paradise. The hotel is only 1 year old hence all the facilities and resources are brand spanking new which is a bonus. All the staff were SO friendly and welcoming which we found to be so lovely. We all felt this was the best hotel we have ever stayed in! It was my first time in Greece and I feel this hotel has truly made it remarkable. Every single part of the hotel is so scenic and photogenic. The Vertigo skybar on level 5 was my favourite, you feel like you have stepped into heaven! A special thank you to Katya who was always willing to answer our questions and help us.    Housekeeping services could be improved on, which we had communicated to staff on our check-out. Our only slight downfall would be that the cleaning services provided were inconsistent, some days we would be given bedside mats, other days we would not. The oil burners would not be lit every day and sometimes makeup remnants would not be cleaned.    Amazing choice of breakfast buffet foods. We also hired a car which the staff would kindly park and bring for us each time we would need it - such a special and personal touch. Thank you very much!"
1/1/1111,50,"Wonderful place, eccellent service!",The staff are very friendly and willing to answer any questions the guest might have. The hotel is extremely well kept. At breakfast we can find everything we can for either a continental or greak meal. Special thanks to Irene T. for her kindness and continued support during our holidays. We recommend this hotel to people who want to get to know Corfu in a special place
1/1/1111,50,Amazing vacation,"Thank you for a wonderful vacation in your amazing hotel.  Angsana Corfu is really the most beautiful hotel we have ever seen.  Looks like paradise, the infinity pool is really gorgeous.  Also the location of the hotel is perfect.  The staff is really lovely especially Irene Tsiknidou who did everything  to make our vacation perfect and always with a smile.    Thanks    Nava Paz- Israel (Eran Polishuk)"
1/1/1111,50,Honeymoon,"Amazing stay for our delayed honeymoon! We got married last year during covid so finally booked angsana corfu as our delayed honeymoon, we booked through easyjet holidays.    From the moment we arrived angsana was amazing! Suitcases taken from us at the door, welcomed to the lobby and brought cold towels & homemade drinks. Cristiana was our host and gave us a full tour of the hotel, our room wasnt ready on arrival and she even brought our room key down to the pool bar where we had lunch while waiting. Cristiana was so lovely and friendly during our whole stay always asking if she could recommend anywhere or book anything for us!    We stayed in a sea view room which was beautiful! There is a mini fridge in the room which we stocked with drinks from a local supermarket, in the evening they had a turn down service where they put bottles of water & chocolates out, a lovely touch.    Angsana is at the top of a hill, to go into benitses the staff always offered to drop us to the bottom in the minivan & it was only a short 10 minute walk from there, we attempted the hill walking home several times & it is a full workout which we regretted everytime!    The hotel offer the same shuttle down to the hotels private beach, we loved this area! They have recently added sand to the beach (corfu is always stony beaches). The waiters bring you drinks the whole time you are there & the bring an ice cooler with free bottled water at beach & pool, although sometimes we had to ask for this or to bring more. They offered snacks at the beach & pool which are reasonably priced. We went for the club sandwich everytime which was £18 but fed 2 of us!    There is a bus stop into corfu old town at the bottom of the hill & concierge printed us a bus timetable. It cost about €10 return for 2 of us & about a 20min journey, the last stop is the old town so no worrying how to know when to get off. Old town is a must, we done it every night, so beautiful & alot livelier than benitses! Restaurants are all lovely & lots of little nik nak shops!    Benitses is a very small village with around 10 shops/restaurants, the restaurants we are in were all lovely! We used the local supermarket to stock up on crisps/alcopops as the hotel didnt sell any of this. We hired a scooter from the rental on the corner, they only charged us €20 for a full day, which is such good value! They offered a dirt buggy at €100 which would be great fun too!    Overall would recommend this hotel to anyone, the setting &building is beautiful would be hard to be beaten!"
1/1/1111,50,Loved every moment of our stay,"Thank you Greece for such amazing welcome! Loved every bit of Corfu, the hospitality (thanks Irene Tsiknidou from Angsana Corfu for being such a lovely host), the generosity, the culture, the smiles, that particular way of seeing life and (last but not least)… the food!    Angsana is for me the best hotel in Corfu. Staff, food and accommodation was just incredible. We really had such an amazing stay!"
1/1/1111,30,Fantastic location and amenities but terrible service,"We have just returned from our trip to the Angsana. The location is absolutely stunning. The hotel is nestled on a hill with the most breathtaking views over to Albania and mainland Greece. The infinity pool, spa and amenities are fantastic, however our holiday was ruined by the terrible service we experienced whilst staying at the hotel.    I completely understand that the travel industry is struggling post Covid but staff appeared to have absolutely no training and could not cope with the number of guests despite it still not being high season.    This culminated in us regularly sitting at breakfast waiting 40 minutes for coffees, they often appeared with no spoons or milk. We then waited another 10 mins for those to arrive. Ordering drinks round the pool was the same. They often took over 30 mins to get to us, after spending ages trying to get the attention of somebody to order with.  We had lunch at the pool bar one day. Our sandwiches took 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to our table. Unfortunately, we were not the only ones who experienced this level of service.    Overall, we had a nice stay, absolutely could not fault the location or amenities - it really is truly stunning but the lack of service let’s the hotel down."
1/1/1111,50,Superb Hotel,"My Husband and I just returned last week from a fabulous break on beautiful Corfu Island. The hotel is in a stunning location high up overlooking the sea and stunning views across to Greece mainland. We had a 1 bedroom villa with our own pool and it was really spacious, comfortable, clean and well equipped. I would recommend the villas because the hotel plays constant banging music around the pool in fact throughout the whole hotel (which could get a bit irritating as it was so repetitive), but at the villa it was peaceful and tranquil yet not far to walk to the main building for restaurants and bars. We were also told by people we met that they had to get up early to put towels out to reserve their sunbeds, we really don't think that should be allowed? The food was excellent at breakfast and both restaurants we ate in on 2 evenings during our week.  The staff are so friendly and helpful and could not do enough for us, but I have to give a special mention to Petros who took us to our villa on day 1 and was always happy to help with cabs and restaurant bookings around the island, he made some excellent choices for us, we never had a bad meal. He even came to see us off and ensured our taxi was on time to return us to the airport, he certainly went above and beyond with service and attention to detail.  We shall certainly be returning back as soon as we can!"
1/1/1111,50,The best place to stay !,"We visited this resort as a couples holiday and were absolutely gobsmacked. The best hotel I have stayed at by far !!! Everything was perfect and thought through. The guest relations made us feel so welcome, as if we were in our own home. I would like to say special thank you’s to Marios, Lilian and Alexandra. They made our stay feel surreal. Marios looked after us and greeted us with smiles every morning, he even went overboard by always conversing with us and asking how our day was. The food was amazing, valet service perfect, pools were unreal, private beach was incredible. Service by all staff was immaculate and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a proper holiday. Thank you Angsana team 🫶🏼"
1/1/1111,40,Almost 5 stars,"We stayed at Angsana for the last two weeks in May and we had the most wonderful time. We hadn't't had a proper holiday since pre-covid times - two which had been booked (at different places) we had to cancel because of covid, so as you can imagine, we were more than ready for a luxury break!    The setting is absolutely stunning. Beautiful pool - the second week we were there it was quite hard to get a sun bed though, so on a couple of occasions we opted to miss breakfast to make sure we got a good spot - our villa did have it's own pool too, so we stayed by that a couple of days, and of course the beach is right there, so we used that a lot, and that is, as you would expect, beautiful. The beach had only just opened when we arrived, so there were a couple of teething problems, but I'm sure those are sorted by now, as by the end of our two weeks it was already a lot more organised.    Botrinis is fantastic - lovely service and exquisite food. We ate there a few times - the vegetarian tasting menu is absolutely fantastic - honestly one of the best I've had anywhere - it was imaginative and delicious, there were no lazy decisions wrt courses. Great wine list too.    Soffrito was a bit hit and miss but we did have some lovely food there - on the first night they had a deconstructed spanakopita which I was disappointed not to see on there the next time we ate there because it was so good.    Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment, if I'm honest - not the food, I have no complaints there at all, but the service was quite shambolic - I see a lot of people have commented on the wait for coffees arriving.. and this was, I think the only proper disappointment we experienced there in the whole two weeks, it's just a shame that it was every single morning apart from the last one... I have no idea what the issue was, the staff individually were all lovely, there just appeared to be some breakdown in communication with regards to coffee orders.    Koh wasn't open when we were there, which was a bit disappointing, but not disappointing enough to affect our enjoyment of the holiday!    Our Guest Relations Manager was Irene, and she was fantastic - she very much made herself at our disposal without being intrusive. She recommended restaurants (Rose Garden - excellent for vegetarians - and Nolita in Corfu town were both great), helped us with with bookings both in and out of the hotel, and sorted taxis - she was absolutely brilliant!    The rest of the staff were very friendly, and by and large, they were good, if a bit disorganised - one or two at the pool and beach seemed a little out of their depth, but it was very early in the season, and I'm sure they've settled in by now. The young guy who did the room service was great - annoyingly, I didn't get his name, so I can't give him a proper shout out, but he was excellent.    This would be a five star review if it weren't for the teething problems - none of which were severe enough to stop us from having an absolutely fantastic time, in a stunning setting... and feeling very sad when the time came to return home.    We will, hopefully, be back one day."
1/1/1111,50,Loved this hotel and it's views!,"Have just come back from a week at Angsana resort. We were a family of 5 people, with children ranging in age from 13 to 1. We had a really wonderful stay. The staff were warm, friendly and very accommodating. We had a fantastic personal concierge, Petros, who helped us with everything from restaurant bookings to arranging activities for both children and adults. He responded really promptly to any enquiries and nothing was too much trouble. We also tried most of the restaurants in the hotel, Botrinis, Sofrito and Koh. The service was excellent and the views outstanding. We are looking forward to come back next year."
1/1/1111,50,Fabulous Stay in pool Villa,"We loved this new contemporary hotel, the setting is amazing, the photos don’t do it justice.    Konstantina, the villa manager, could not do enough to ensure we had a fantastic holiday.    The buffet breakfast was enjoyable but there were a few issues with the service, particularly with hot drinks and A la carte food, perhaps still teething troubles.    We had a lovely dinner in Botrini’s one evening and the 2 evenings we ate in Sofrito’s we thoroughly enjoyed the food and atmosphere    The tavernas we visited in Benistes, just about 2k away, were of a high standard, lovely food and drinks along with friendly helpful staff. Its an easy walk along to the village but we opted to taxi home due to the long steep drive up to the hotel.    The Spa is gorgeous and the treatments we received were excellent.    We are music lovers and appreciate many genres of good music, unfortunately the hotel owners didn’t share our love of real music and the majority of the time only offered what we term as tuneless noise, piped out in the restaurants, bars and even at the beach, it was extremely irritating and also annoyed many of our fellow guests. There is an occasional live music act in the evenings offering a bit of light relief.    Perhaps a few more sun loungers and the addition of a children’s playground, in the shade, would further enhance the appeal of the hotel.    This hotel is in its infancy, it has the potential to be spectacular in the future.  We are looking forward to a return visit later this year."
1/1/1111,50,Best 5star hotel in Corfu,"Today i'm gonna share our amazing experience with Angsana hotel. We spent 11 nights in this gorgeous place. The hotel is located in a picturusque village, Benitses. The view from our villa was simply stunning! Every morning it was so great to see all these breathtaking  sunrises right from your own pool. We also had a number of different compliments from the hotel, such as a bottle of Greek red wine, a variety of homemade sweets and a mini bar with a nice choice of different hard and soft beverages and snacks (the current fulfilment is free of charge).   All the staff are extremely polite and do their best to make you feel like you are the most valuable guest. I saw lots of different, controversial comments regarding the staff (someone faced with ""rude"" and ""unpolite"" behaviour), but honestly, it wasn't our experience... I can't say even a bad word regarding the staff, everybody was so nice and trying to do all the best to help us with every small request.    It was the first time for me personally when i managed to relax and not to think about my job, current problems and so forth. We were just enjoying our holidays!     All the current information about your stay is on your TV. Not only dining menus and upcoming events, but your bill also (track your expenses, really handy thing isn't it?:) )    If you are planning to visit Corfu your best choice is Angsana!    Here are also some useful tips:    1. The hotel is located on a hilltop, so if you don't wanna ""climb"" by yourself, don't be shy to ask for a transfer to take you upstairs or downstairs. It's free of charge.    2. Book a villa. It's definitely worth the money.    3. Visit Vertigo roof top bar ( on the 5th floor). The bar itself and the variety of drinks are really impressive.     4. Visit Benitses village. There you may find a new small marina with an amazing restaurant, Captain Jackos with the freshest, perfectly cooked fish."
1/1/1111,30,"You pay for the facilities and location, not the service","The Angsana is beautifully situated with stunning views. Overall we enjoyed our experience at the hotel and in general staff are helpful. However this was not quite the 5 star experience we were hoping for.    The good:    - The Facilities: Nice pool area and private beach with an efficient shuttle service. The view from here is extraordinary and something you don’t get bored of. There is also a large gym which was well equipped with friendly staff, Spa & indoor pool    - The Room: large room, with sizeable balcony and comfortable bed. Nice sized bathroom.    - Front Staff: very helpful and friendly with our luggage. Also efficient when picking up our rented car.    The not so good:    - Breakfast Service: There is a lovely buffet for breakfast with a great deal of options. However, there doesn’t seem to be much communication between the staff. You are led to a table but often you are not asked if you want drinks and 50% of the time we never received our complete order    - Beach Lunch: Lunch at the beach seems to consist of pre made sandwiches that you would be disappointed if you got in the supermarket. They are also ridiculously priced for what they are, costing more than a main meal in most nearby restaurants. Worth nothing that this is different to lunch at the pool where it is very nice.    - Value for money: The value for money at the beach is also reflected throughout the other food/drink options at the hotel. Both Sofrito and Koh are in a lovely setting, but it seems that this is what you pay for. The food in Sofrito was fairly average. Koh was much nicer but also extremely expensive for what you got.    - Housekeeping: Our room was rarely cleaned before 5/5:30 when we came up from the pool which was inconvenient. The room was also left fairly dusty and certain areas were not cleaned around/water not topped up every day. The do not disturb sign was also ignored on a few occasions.    Overall a relaxing and enjoyable stay, but worth noting that you seem to pay 5 star prices for the location and views, not necessarily the service."
1/1/1111,50,Best hotel in Corfu,"One of the best hotels I've ever been to. The most amazing infinity pool with the greatest view in the island overlooking the sea.  The friendliest staff you will ever encountet, all smiling and kind.  The rooms are cleaned 2 to 3 times a day.  A very large breakfast buffet, with some vegan and gluten free options as well. There is also soy milk for coffee/cereal.  The pool offers smoothies with almond milk options, beyond burger (vegan) on the menu :)  A fully equipped gym with treadmills among other equipment, with an activity schedule with trainers, free of charge, including yoga, pilates, core training, and an indoor pool as well.  Christos F (the trainer) was especially kind and accomodating. Great core training!  The spa is the most upscale spa I've ever experienced- kind professional staff, a private large stylish room for the massage including a toilet, shower and personal safe if you wish.  My massage therapist Niki was amazing- just the right amount of pressure, and was very sweet and soothing.  The tall thin bald gentleman massage therapist (we forgot his name) was also excellent and so nice and sweet.  Truly one of the best vacations we've ever had.  There was a taxi driver named George that we kept calling for because he was so nice and took care of us. Forgot the name of the company, works often with the hotel, he's older and silver-haired, and drives a black mini-van. Ask for George! :)  Thank  you for an excellent stay! Worth every penny ❤"
1/1/1111,50,Gorgeous amazing hotel with exemplary staff. Philoxenia is standard.,"Fabulous hotel perched on a hill with panoramic view of the gorgeous Ionian sea and Benitses village about 1 km away. Room 424 offers two balconies and the view is simply insane. A private beach is accessible by shuttle mini bus every 30 mins. The staff at Sofrito and Koh restaurants were equally wonderful and exemplary and hospitality/xenia come as standard. Massive thank you to Christina, Maria, Spiros, Thanos, Victoria, Sofia, Alexandros [Manager] and Konstantinos [ F & B manager] for making our stay a first class enduring experience."
1/1/1111,10,"Below Standards, beware of your expectations","We stayed at Angsana Corfu in the end of May 2022.  And what a disappointment.  I believe Banyan Tree should review the agreement they have managing this hotel because this will be bad publicity on their name.    I will try to keep this review short since it is always sad to make a negative review.    The positive:  Location. From this locations you can quickly access beaches on both sides of the Island, East and West. Also a quick drive to many sightseeing locations. Close to Benitses centre where You find many great Restaurants.  The seeting on the Hill with Beautiful views to Ionian Sea and nice Infinity Pool.  We had support from a lovely Concierge, Katia. She was the exception in kindness among the staff.    The negatives:  Bad service overall from restaurants, beach, pool and Housekeeping.  They have a lot of staff but they are under trained and seem to be unhappy. Some of the staff was not friendly, and a few times displayed an aggressive attitude towards us, when we asked for the most simple things.  Breakfast, below standard for a Banyan Tree 5 stars hotel in what concerns food quality and diversity. Caffe takes forever to be brought to the table. Often just when we had ended our meal. The floor was never cleaned between clients and a few times I had to mind where to step to avoid fallen food getting to my shoes.  Housekeeping. Terrible. Rooms where poorly cleaned. Twice, while having the privacy light on, staff came in to my room. And we where not fully dressed.  The corridors accessing the rooms where dirty the whole time.  Beach Bar food is just cold sandwiches or salads and with poor quality.  Room. We were given a connecting room although we asked for individual room. We where told the hotel was fully booked and we could not move to another. Next day we got a call telling us they had another room but we had already unpacked. And yes You can hear everything that goes on, on the connecting neighbouring room.    Upon arrival until checking out nobody asked us if we enjoyed our stay. Exception to a bell boy that helped us with our luggage when leaving.    I could share more negatives but it isn't a pleasure to do so.  We also spoke with other guests who shared the same feeling of disappointment.    Sadly I cannot recommend this hotel."
