"September 27, 2022",5.0,Incredible Sights!,We took the walk from Aeleos Beach Resort the Achilleion late one afternoon knowing that the museum was partially closed but still wanted to see what remained open. Its a difficult trek on foot actually so wear suitable shoes if you are walking there. Once there it is clear that there is substantial work going on to the property and that there is only a limited view of the gardens available. As a huge fan of Greek mythology i was disappointed but knew already that there was limited access. The gardens themselves are pretty and the view of Corfu town and the coast is incredible! Literally something from a Bond film. The two major statues of Achilles are actually much more impressive in person in both size and detail. I would love to return here once it reopens fully.
"September 27, 2022",3.0,Major renovation underway,"Much appreciated by German speakers due to this being built on behalf of ‚ÄúSissy‚Äù of the Austro Hungarian empire, who has taken on a mythical reputation, ending in her demise in Geneva. The building is undergoing total renovation, presumably having been neglected for a sustained period. The only bit open is part of the modest garden. A few statues have been renovated. Parking along the street. Entrance 5 euros."
"September 25, 2022",3.0,"Not now, maybe later","Extended re-furbishing works are in progress, so interior of the palace is not opened for visitors and most of outdoors exhibits are also surrounded by scaffolding. Probably in 2023 or even later the place would look totally different than now. Gorgeous view of the surrounding landscape at the end of the garden (towards the sea)."
"September 19, 2022",3.0,We have to come back when it is re-opened,"The interior is not accessible due to refurbishing works, which also affect the exterior. The main garden is lovely."
"September 7, 2022",3.0,Palace visit,"It was OK, the Palace is being refurbished at present so you can only go in the gardens. Fabulous views. It was really busy while we were there. Worth a visit at ‚Ç¨5 per person."

"August 18, 2022",3.0,15 min walk outdoor,Nice history and wonderful location. Only 2 stars as the interiors are under complex restoration work with a hand of people ( no more agitation to conclude the work soon). There are not provided info about the location and no curator in place. They can do more at that location. Tickets are expensive for just outdoor walking.

"July 13, 2022",3.0,"Lovely place, but take care of planned restoration works","Be aware, as per the venues website there is major restoration work on going.  Google translate of the website front page:  From 1/6/2022 to 30/9/2022 the imperial gardens of the Achilles Museum will be open to the public. Opening hours: daily: 8:00 - 20:00 Due to upgrading and restoration work, the interior of the Museum will remain closed. Read more here"
"July 10, 2022",2.0,Waste of time and money...,"Waste of time and 6 euros - The whole building is under major renovation with NO internal access of any kind. Waste of time driving all the way to see a scaffolding display. The gardens are not even fully open and it only takes 5 mins to walk around the part that is open, total rip off for 6 euros each - not recommended to visit."
"June 21, 2022",5.0,achillion palace,wonderful museum with impressive artifacts and decorations. early morning is recomended for a visit to avoid large groups.
"May 28, 2022",1.0,Website misleading......,"This was on our to do list while in Corfu and we checked out the website before making the drive there to make sure of opening times, etc. Told us it would be closed from 1 June to Sept, 2022 for refurbishment and that the gardens were open for visitors regardless. Sadly, both those statements were incorrect. Not only was the house already closed (had been for a while) but the gardens were also closed, so a wasted trip, annoyingly. Wish some of these places would get their info correct on their websites so wasted journeys are not made and time wasted! Judging by the numbers of cars there, plus people trying to get in - and coaches (!!) - it would appear we were not the only ones with a wasted trip...."
"May 5, 2022",5.0,Time machine,"We visited this villa several times - because one visit is not enough. It is a pity that there is no space for presentation and other stories besides this official one - the building used, during its history, as villa for noblemen, military hospital, orphan institution, casino and, an the end, - as museum."
"December 26, 2021",5.0,Beautiful Palace and Gardens,"Our final stop on our HAL tour was the village of Gastouri, where we visited Achilleion Palace, the mansion built by Empress Elisabeth of Austria and later owned by Kaiser Wilhelm II. It is wonderful inside and has beautiful gardens and statues. It was by far our most interesting stop on our tour.. The gardens are beautiful. The two most important statues are both of Achillies (Achillies in his prime and the dying Achllies). And there is a great view from the garden. The German sculptor Ernst Herter was commissioned to create works inspired from Greek mythology. His sculpture Dying Achilles, created in Berlin in 1884 as inscribed in the statue, forms the centrepiece of the Achilleion Gardens. German Kaiser Wilhelm II purchased Achilleion in 1907 and he commissioned his own Achilles statue from the sculptor Johannes G√∂tz who created an imposing bronze sculpture that stands as guardian of the gardens, facing north toward the city."
"December 4, 2021",4.0,Visit in museum,This place doesn‚Äôt have a lot to offer. Outside the palace were some building works. Museum has a lot of history inside. It is great to see that people takie care of such kind things.
"November 17, 2021",3.0,Crowded,"This site does have lots of history, however we visited on a day with cruise ships and it was jammed pack inside. The outside is nice with feature statures and a somewhat view of Old Town. Displays are a bit tired and some with better descriptions. Museum is worn and tired. Only can view downstairs."
"November 16, 2021",1.0,Beware: Selling tickets though closed!,"When I arrived by public transportation, I was told it was closed. However, the website says it is open, and is selling tickets online. Also, the front of the entrance said it was open, and every Google search I did before arriving, including this one, said it was open as well. What a disappointment to see it closed. Had to wait two hours in the rain for the next bus back to Corfu. When I asked the front entrance employees why they don‚Äôt update their website to state it is closed, and noted how it is an inconvenience for people to make their way to the site, only to find it closed, then have to wait two hours for the next bus, I was told rather bluntly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my problem.‚Äù No, it isn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs a poor reflection of the way the place is being run‚Ä¶especially since it‚Äôs still selling tickets online! Good luck in getting your money back. The place doesn‚Äôt even deserve one star‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs still selling tickets online."
"November 3, 2021",5.0,Amazing view,"Did not know what to expect, walked there from our hotel and was surprised to see many coaches and lots of visitors. Vaccination certificate required to enter. Well worth a visit."
"October 27, 2021",2.0,Not really worth the entry fee,"So disappointed with our visit. Two adults, two teenagers & a 7yr old cost us ‚Ç¨36. We were there for about 15min tops as all the top floors were closed and there really wasn‚Äôt much to see. All the nice items are actually posted on hereüòÖ. We drove 2km down a winding path for a lovely lunch near the water though, so probably plan for that first as many of the lunch places, besides basic sandwiches, are still closed."
"October 26, 2021",3.0,"Beautiful building and gardens, but a lack of information and lots closed off for the 10‚Ç¨ entry price","The palace itself is beautiful and grand, and you cannot view the outside fully without buying a ticket. It's wonderful to look at (despite the aging, which I like - I don't expect to see it as pristine as it originally would have been) but once inside only the bottom floor is open.  There is an information board outside, brief leaflets inside (they had no English ones left unfortunately, but plenty of other languages available), but limited information other than that. There are small plagues with brief descriptions near items, but they are vague and don't even have dates to know which period they are from. All in all, it doesn't take long to get around the bottom floor.  The gardens are beautiful and you get to see the statues of Achilles and a great view over to Corfu Old Town. Otherwise there is not much else to see in the whole place. Even if you can't see anymore inside, it'd be nice to be able to explore the grounds more as they head down toward the beach. There is building work being done so maybe they are planning on opening more of the building up to the public, but they should reduce the price in the meantime."
"October 25, 2021",3.0,A fading memory of better times,"The museum is small and not of much interest. The garden, however, is lovely. With the house, in need of some TLC, this is likely more of interest to ladies of a certain age. Don't take the kids."
"October 21, 2021",3.0,Great sight,"This is a palace build for the Austrian empress sisi. The entrance fee of 10 Euro giving u access to the ground floor of the mansion and the garden. It is a bit sad to see, that preservation works are not really gone that far, the mansion and the garden have seen better times."
"October 19, 2021",2.0,Very sad visit,"I have never seen a building in such a state of dilapidation . One is only aware that the building is being renovated when one arrives at the ticket office. The only floor which is open is the ground floor with very little explanation- the paintings have been taken off the walls and there is no indication which room is which. In fact Sissy only visited this summer house twice a year during eight years - just before she was unfortunately assassinated. The gardens and the exterior of the house are in a deplorable state and the only thing worth seeing is the view over to Corfu town, the famous ceiling in the hallway. and the statues of Achille. It is a real sad state of affairs that the Greek gouvernement can Allie this to happen."
"October 14, 2021",2.0,The gardens were nice but the palace was very limited.,"This felt like a safe experience, visitors were asked to provide proof of Covid vacation before entering.  Upon entering it looks impressive however there was construction being carried out on the upper levels.  The palace was underwhelming as only the ground floor was available and this was limited in what it offered. Some of the Empresses dresses and some old furniture.  The history of the palace is given to visitors in a pamphlet to read and gain some insight into the building.  Due to the constitution the exit from the garden was closed which means walking back through the gardens which is still nice but be aware there are many steps and stairs and no alternative for those who may need one.  There were several people throughout the garden cleaning and restoring some of the statues and garden ornaments which I'm sure will look great when completed."
"October 13, 2021",2.0,Only ground floor accessible to guests.,This isn't worth the money. Be aware you will only be able to see the bottom floor of the palace museum which is rather small and the objects on display aren't interesting at all. They do not make people aware of this before entering and by this point you've already paid. I wouldn't recommend.
"October 1, 2021",5.0,Remarkable place,A remarkable place that takes you back in time. I hope one day people will take care of the statues and the building. Will visit again.
"September 29, 2021",2.0,Stressful,"Not a great experience for us, not prepared for the extremely narrow road up to the museum and did not realise massive tour buses and local busses go up there and literally force you off the road with nowhere to go. The museum is not filled with any Sisi artifacts, instead some stuffy costumes of Maria Callas and some photos of Kaiser Wilhelm and others. Nothing is explained well and yes, upstairs is closed of course. The outside of the buildings are derilict and the trees now so tall and not cut back at all, no sea views from the terrace. Were dreading to go back the same windy, narrow road. Very stressful experience! My advice - avoid driving up there unless very early in the morning. Don't bother going up there if you are hoping for some original Sisi furniture or clothing. or photos."
"September 18, 2021",3.0,Bit of a rip off!,Low rating because they charged us the full entry price of ‚Ç¨10 despite only being open on the ground floor. Upstairs they are restoring. Gardens open and it was very nice but they should only be charging half price for that. You need to show your covid vaccine proof for entry too which some people weren't aware of.
"September 18, 2021",2.0,Currently not good value,"Currently not worth the entrance fee! I would like to have written a positive review but given the cost of 10 euros I cannot! The history of this place really intereted me andi was aware there would be floors closed off but I expected the floor on view to be impressive. Why not at least have photos of the grand interiors and information about the work being done? The gardens must have been lovely in their day and the views great but it felt uncared for. I am sure it is a matter of staffing and cost but the National Trust manage such renovation times so well. I will continue to use the net to research this property. I learnt so !little from this visit! A lovely building but not a lot for the fee. If you go, arriving at about 9 was fine. After that, so many tour groups made it less pleasant."
"September 12, 2021",4.0,Historical Corfu Gem,"So glad we made the effort to make it out to the palace. About 20 minutes and a taxi from the old town. A beautiful building with a wonderful history. A shame about the building work that was being carried out, but still worth the trip"
"September 9, 2021",3.0,Spoilt by the building work,Only giving 3 stars as most of the property and top level of the grounds are closed due to renovation.  ¬£10 Euros for 5 rooms and a well manicured country estate garden a bit steep think there should be a discount whilst it's being worked on .  Anyway the grounds are great lots of photo opportunities remaking James bond scenes .  Not that busy for a sunny Thursday afternoon was able to take photos and stroll through the grounds pretty much to out selves .  Parking easy lots of free roadside or large parking a short stroll away .  Is it worth a visit yes historic importance just a shame about the renovations
"September 8, 2021",5.0,"Views, gardens, memorabilia & apple pie - lovely!","Beautiful views, gardens and interior, a lovely couple of hours. Happy to pay ‚Ç¨10 each to contribute towards the upkeep of such a lovely place. The gardens and views across to Corfu Town, bay and airport were the highlight for us. Only the ground floor of the museum is currently open, but fascinating memorabilia of Kaiser Wilhelm and an exhibition about Maria Callas were interesting. We visited on our last day in Corfu, before heading to the airport (15 mins away) and it was a perfect visit, the gardens in the sunshine were beautiful and not crowded. We finished up at the Bella Vista cafe (just down the hill to the right of the museum) - recommend their delicious apple pie & lemonade on their terrace."
"September 2, 2021",3.0,Overpriced!,It‚Äôs beautiful but you‚Äôre not allowed 1 photo per person in front of the main staircase. That‚Äôs what they told us after we paid ‚Ç¨10 each to enter.  There are more beautiful places that are free to enter in London!
"August 28, 2021",2.0,"Partially closed, not worth the trip","There are extensive repairs going on at the moment, not before time as the building is not in a good state of repair, so only the ground floor is available to view. The views over the bay from the are good but on the whole it‚Äôs not a very interesting place to visit. We got no sense of the life lived in the building, we moved from room to room without it capturing our imagination"
"August 23, 2021",2.0,Expensive and partially closed,"Monday 23rd August we drove from our accommodation in Barbati to visit this former Palce. We were advised by a local Taverna owner that here was a place to see.  We parked up in the free car park and climbed an exhausting number steps up to where the old palace, now Museum is located.  Frankly we were shocked to see that the entrance fee was ‚Ç¨10, especially when there was a sign advising visitors that sections of the building were closed or refurbishment and repairs.  We thought we would not bother with the museum, seemed to bit of a rip off, but would have a stroll through the gardens so we walked in through the gates. We were soon followed by a lady shouting ""ticket ticket"" we asked if we had to pay to visit the gardens, yes full entrance fee. We promptly left.  There were a number of organised tour coaches parked up outside, dread to think how much they paid for the experience."
"August 20, 2021",5.0,"""Loyal"" environment",Great location. Amazing statues of Achilleas. The palace has many exhibits. The garden is also very nice.
"August 18, 2021",4.0,Achilleon Palace visit,"I recommend making your own way by bus to this attraction, as this worked well allowing us to spend what time we wanted to there. Part of the exterior was closed off during our visit for ongoing renovation. It was not expensive to get in and overall an enjoyable visit. There is a distillery opposite, free to visit, which is worth calling in to sample the local liquor. We spent about two hours there in total and covered everything."
"August 7, 2021",4.0,Palace and gardens were gorgeous,A definite must when on Corfu This belonged to the Empress of the Austrio-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th century. It is well maintained and architecturally displays what can be done when money is unlimited. The only dissapointment was that you are limited to the first floor. There are four plus I assume a k8tchen and cellerb which are not on display
"August 1, 2021",5.0,Worth to visit - we'll go again,Very exciting museum in beautiful surroundings. Even though its undergoing renovation there were many things to see and we really enjoyed it :-)
"July 20, 2021",2.0,The destruction continues.,"At the moment, it is not possible to rate highly. ""Renovation"" in progress 3/4 of the building is excluded from viewing, for 10 ‚Ç¨ for a ticket for 20 minutes of sightseeing, it is very poor. Pictures and objects are indescribable. No work is in progress but you cannot go to that rooms that could be better used are occupied by an unrelated exhibition about Maria Callas. Everything is decaying, fungus on the wall. The longer I visit Corfu, the more I am convinced that the inhabitants do not care what they got. They're more interested in taking the parking fee."
"July 18, 2021",4.0,"The Achellion Palace - hard to access, but worth a visit.","This attraction is in an isolated area. If you go with a tour company, they charge an absurd amount of money, and basically, you‚Äôre paying the tour outfit for a ride to/from the palace. Far better value to take the #10 bus from the central square in the city. You can purchase tickets either from the clearly marked ticket /information kiosk in the square or from the driver onboard. The cost is 1.5 euros in each direction, and the tricky thing is that the boarding venue is 200m from the main square. The Palace is the final stop, and the ride takes 20 minutes going, and 30 minutes on the return. The Palace only takes 45 minutes to tour, and it‚Äôs crucial to know that buses return from the Palace to Corfu at 12.20, 2.50, and 5.20, so plan the bus from Corfu accordingly, so you don‚Äôt get stuck at the Palace, waiting 2 hours for the return. I recommend going early in the day, both because of the heat, but also, because the big tour buses come in the afternoon. The admission in 10 euros, 8 for those over 65. The garden in the back of the palace is lovely, and the piece de resistance is the sculpture of the death of Achilles. Due to renovation inside, only the ground floor is currently open."
"July 18, 2021",4.0,A place filled with history,"Great place if you're looking for some history of the place! I was fascinated by this spot and enjoyed spending some good quality time there. The disadvantage was that we only were allowed to visit the ground floor because the others are in full renovation. However, it's a must-see if you're ever in need of something else!"
"July 13, 2021",5.0,"Beautiful palace, amazing surroundings","We have visited Achilleion even though the latest reviews were rather negative. The ongoing construction works affecting the 1st floor are certainly a disadvantage (and so is also the fact that the entire place need further refurbishment and maintenance) but still, the place is beautiful and is well worth a visit. It is full of history and works of art (from paintings to beautiful sculptures and amazing pieces of furniture, beautiful fire places and an amazing central staircase). The outside gardens, sculptures and the views to Corfu Town and around are amazing. A place not to be missed if you want to taste also a little history and art, apart from the sea and sun."
"July 11, 2021",1.0,Don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time, there is much better place to see in Corfu Island. We visited The Achillion Palace on 10.07.2021, basically everything under construction, access to few room of the Palace - very poor exhibitions. We finished in 10 min our visit. Nice view from the garden. Entrance fee 10‚Ç¨. Not recommended."
"July 10, 2021",2.0,Still requires plenty of TLC!!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Benitses (staying at the recently opened Angsana Corfu Hotel - Review to follow) and this afternoon decided to go to the nearby Achillion Museum/Palace pay to see if things had improved since our last visit some 3 years ago (see previous Review).  Unfortunately, it quickly became clear on arrival that much of the property was unavailable due to ongoing refurbishment so we decided to delay our return visit until next year. Hopefully by then there will have been a significant improvement as this is potentially a first-class attraction!!"
"July 8, 2021",3.0,"A little disappointed, but it is open (July 2021)","I was a little disappointed. The building itself needs attention (it is getting it). Only the one floor is set up as a museum and it was moderately interesting. The grounds have good views (but they are easy to get in Corfu!), but you cannot walk far. At least it's open after COVID!"

"November 15, 2020",5.0,Beautiful palace with a fascinating history,Beautiful palace with a fascinating history! From Sisi to Weilheim to Casino to hospital no wonder it‚Äôs possibly lost many of its prize possessions. The gardens and views are amazing. Check out the James Bond connection and the really quirky cafe (with a terrace filled with unusual collection of old machines and tools including half an old VW camper van!) opposite. Of course we were ‚Äòlucky‚Äô to avoid coach load of tourists (during COVID hit quiet season).
"November 1, 2020",5.0,Spectacular view of Corfu town,"When we came here last time, 40 years ago, it was still a Casino. Now a museum, really worth getting the audio tour. Be aware that you have to leave your Passport or Driver‚Äôs License as security."

"October 6, 2020",4.0,Well worth a visit.,"Despite what it says on the main Trip Advisor page, this is open. It is not perhaps open as much as in the past, but plenty to see for a short visit. Interesting history and lovely gardens, and interiors. Good views of Corfu town. Some of the statues were a little dirty though! And some of the commentary a bit too specialised without enough overview. You have to leave your passport or driving licence as security for the audio guide but that is not compulsory. If you are driving, as we were, we would strongly advise taking the coast road to near Benitses, and not trying to follow the signposted fork if coming from Corfu Town. The signs soon run out and though we must have been very close we ended up driving along small roads on a full hour diversion!"
"October 3, 2020",4.0,Good but needs maintenance,We enjoyed our visit it was worthwhile! Most interesting and the gardens are lovely. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling the the Greek Government as pocketing the cash but not reinvesting into the this amazing attesting. Things need cleaning! Things need tidying! Things need painting! Come on pull your finger out this a majestic little place and you are not maintaining it properly. What a mighty shame! Despite this some of the views from the gardens are draw dropping. The statue of Achilles is magnificent! The interior is very nice! But lacks a certain something! The painting on the top floor staircase is turkey wonderful.
"October 1, 2020",3.0,"Lovely gardens, disappointing interiors for a palace",I'm glad I visited as I'd read so much about Empress Sisi of Austro-Hungary. I found the style of the interior very gaudy but it was interesting to visit. The gardens and views were really spectacular and the outside courtyard garden with all the statutory was also worth seeing. The Achilles statue put in by Kaiser Wilhelm was really ugly and showed the arrogance of the man that caused the First World War. I think the museum should move the statue from its dominating location and return the original Achilles of Empress Sisi's era back to its original location. The history was interesting and I enjoyed the visit overall.
"September 29, 2020",5.0,Beautiful grounds,Personally I didn‚Äôt care much about the exhibits inside the museum. The felt a little eclectic and weren‚Äôt displaying in a way that you could get a feel of how the owners of the house loved. However the grounds are spectacular and the views breathtaking and for that alone it‚Äôs worth the few euros it costs to enter.
"September 23, 2020",4.0,beautiful building in fantastic location,"very much worth a visit. fabulous building with lovely gardens and tremendous views over the island towards the capital. great history regarding how,why and when it was built. we got there by car.not sure if there is a bus service as it is a little off the beaten track. entrance not expensive and you can wander round the house and gardens at your liesure"

"August 9, 2020",4.0,A Must-see. Worth every penny.,"Nice audio narration tour, got the feeling and atmosphere from an era 150 years ago. Amazing gardents and statues.  Achileas sufferring statue was breathtaking.  Try to get there before 12:00 to avoid lot's of persons."
"July 28, 2020",4.0,Time for restoration,What a pity the Greek government Does not maintain this property and the German kaizer sold the original furniture and belongings of Sissi. now with almost empty rooms the museum looses a lot of its grandeur it must have had some 120years ago We liked though the anecdotes on the audio guide that tried to bring back alive the atmosphere of this country palace. Garden and rooftop terrace are in an acceptable state And the views are magnificent
"July 24, 2020",4.0,Very interesting,Lots of things to see. Historical artefacts and things about the people who lived there etc. Gardens with great views.
"May 1, 2020",4.0,"Beautiful villa and garden, not much furniture inside","Achilleion Palace was built by Empress Elizabeth of Austria, known as Sisi, as a refuge. She was unhappy during her life and after the death of 2 of her children she travelled around much. Finally she visited this summer palace just a few times. We visited also her palaces in Vienna which were much more decorated. The garden is lovely, we had the luck that there were not so many tourists during our visit. Mentionable is the staircase which is an architectural delight. We visited in 2018."
"April 27, 2020",5.0,Magnificent place!,"The magnificent Achilleion Palace was built on the top of a wooden hill, in Gastouri village, on Corfu island, by the most beloved Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, also known as Sissi, during the years 1889-1891. The empress chose Corfu to build her palace, a place where she found consolation after her son Rudolph‚Äôs suicide. An exquisite piece of art, the palace was built in Pompeian-style with luxurious, neoclassical living rooms. In the beautiful gardens, one can admire the famous statue of Achilles in his death throes. The beloved hero of Greek mythology, Achilles is the central theme of the palace and from which the name of the palace is derived. Corfu was Elisabeth's favourite vacation destination and in sign of admiration for Greece and its culture raised the magnificent Achilleion. Achilleion palace is indeed a masterpiece... Review written by Claudia Pavel poet, author of the poetry collection The odyssey of my lost thoughts, 2018."
"April 27, 2020",5.0,A Night filled with Stars,"Having flown in for a childhood friends wedding, we were whisked through the windy roads upon the completion of the ceremony on a nearby island.  Front arriving at the front to entry the grand entrance while making our way to the patio. The evening gala was befit for a King or Queen (or Bride and Groom on our case)  Words can not describe the atmosphere which has been engrained in my mind as it felt surreal in comparison to seeing the museum during the day ..."
"March 25, 2020",5.0,"Unmissable, if you visit Corfu !!","This is actually a palace, built by Empress Elizabeth (Sisi) of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in the early 1890's. Sisi used it as her summer palace. Not the biggest palace I have seen, but perhaps one of the most delightful to explore, and wander around. Photos are allowed. And the place is a photo buff's delight. Plenty of rooms, staircases, paintings, curios, old photos, statues, gardens, etc..etc...to photograph. This palace is so damn INTERESTING, as compared to many larger and stuffier palaces I have seen. The rooms, the furniture, the curios, and especially the gardens. You get fantastic views from the gardens. A guide would be helpful, but you can manage without a guide. (audio guides are available). We were on a conducted tour, so we had a guide to explain things to us. If possible, try and get the brochure relating to this place from the hotel or from the tourist office, and read it thoroughly BEFORE you visit the palace. You will better appreciate what you see. Don't miss the statue of Sisi at the entrance, and the two great statues of Achilles in the gardens. This palace was easily the highlight of my visit to Corfu."
"February 18, 2020",5.0,Nice place,Place in a very beautiuful area. If you want to visit it in detail you have to speed a face hours. You can receive an audio guide to help you discovery the history of the place. On sunny days you can sit in the garden palace. It's worth visiting
"February 18, 2020",5.0,Viennese atmosphere in Corfu,"An amazing palace - wisely chosen to be built in a location where the view is breathtaking and a vast scenery can be admired - The palace was ordered by Princess Sissi of Austria, thus bears this 19th century European aura.. Laden with works of art and sculpture inspired by Ancient Greek mythology... If only the well known statue of Achilles were preserved in a way that suits the place"
"January 23, 2020",4.0,Beautiful morning,"Can recommend to go early in the morning, before the tourist busses show up. That way, you can enjoy the villa's art in peace (especially the garden, where you have two Achilles statues to admire)"
"December 28, 2019",4.0,Interesting place to visit when in Corfu,"We visited Achilleion in may on a rainy day, so we¬¥ve got a bit different impression of Sissis palace, park and statues. Still, this is island¬¥s must-see, both culturally and historically, and we had a nice half-day excursion. The palace and the gardens are not very large, tickets cost is moderate, and panoramic views from the top of the hill towards the old town are not to be missed. If coming by car, there can be difficult to find a parking spot, and a ticket line can be rather long, so be prepared. By the entrance there are a number of tourist restaurants and shops, and inside the area I think there is a restaurant."
"November 13, 2019",5.0,History explained by brilliant Tour Guide,"Day excursion on Corfu Island - this was the attraction everybody seems to visit. Splendor of the 19th Century, used in a James Bond film as the casino venue. Downside is that it is over crowded and needs better access and management as a tourist venue. Sculptures and statues, paintings and pictures. The story behind the building is essential to understand and"
"November 10, 2019",3.0,Mediocre,"Place is poorly restored. All the nice paintings on the walls are painted over... Very crowded during Octobert too. Even the yard was not kept well, tall grass and leaves all over. Building and statues are nice, but it really needs more work to make it a nicer place, now I would say it wasnt worth the ticket priece."
"November 3, 2019",5.0,"A beautiful 1890's palace, well preserved","From the moment you enter the grounds, you feel the splendor of another age. The marble floors and pillars, painted ceilings and beautiful art and furniture all give you a feeling of awe. We learned about the interesting history of the palace and Sisi, the Empress of Austria, who had it built as a retreat. There are some steps to navigate, but generally accessible."
"October 31, 2019",4.0,A Pretty Retreat,"It is always interesting to see how royalty lived in Europe. The main staircase is beautiful and be sure to check out the ceiling. It was a little disappointing to see that there were not many original furnishings, but learning that it used to be a casino, I was happy the see that they displayed some photos and personal belongings of the original residents. Make sure that you go to the gardens to see the impressive sculptures and the bathtub."
"October 28, 2019",5.0,Sightseeing,It is a small cute palace which definitely deserves a visit. It easily be very crowded so early morning visit is a must.
"October 24, 2019",5.0,Lovely and unexpected treasure,"What a beautiful place and so well maintained. The audio guide was included in the price. While many visitors came with tourist buses, we came by ourselves on the Blue Corfu city bus. Easy to do. Highly recommend."
"October 23, 2019",2.0,Gorgeous gardens but buyer beware...,"We arrived at Achilleion Museum after walking up the hill from Kaiser Bridge. Upon arrival we paid 20 Euros for two of us to enter the museum. Trying to collect audioguides - promptly asked for our passports or driving licenses. As we had hiked there we had neither and were told categorically that the only way we could therefore have a guide was if we left a credit card with them. Now I am a trusting guy but there was no way this was happening. I explained that as we had hiked to the museum we hadn't given any thought to bringing passports. The reply was a shrug and a clear look of ""tough"". We walked around the museum but there is almost no explanation of the items on display or their significance. Here is a painting of someone you don't know meeting someone else you don't know at a time when you don't know what is happening....As someone that has managed a number of venues that use audioguides I do know that it is infuriating when they go missing but really - all you need is an exit door alarm triggered by the guide if it goes beyond a certain point. In most cases it is an accident as the guides have little or no value away from the place they are designed for! The gardens and the views are worth seeing - guide or not - but not worth 20 Euros for two people. Upon leaving I avoided the exit signs and went back to the ticket office to see if there is any mention before you pay about the need for ID to get an audioguide - there isn't. Probably wouldn't return."
"October 21, 2019",4.0,Worth the Trip,"Had to get a bus for the 11 km trip from Corfu port. Worth doing. The property is interesting with a recreation of rooms. A lot of area is still closed. The grounds were full of statues and interesting landscaping, great views from the property with plenty of good photos to be had.  Spend about an hour there and have a good look around. Eating places and souvenir shops are all around the area."
"October 21, 2019",3.0,where' s the needed maintenance?,"I have been to the Hofburg in Vienna, Versailles in Paris and so on, which are all great maintained palaces/ museums in Europe. I really like history and I was so looking forward visiting the Achilleion, but it was somewhat a let down. The outside of the building looks great, but the inside is empty, worn out carpets etc badly maintained! Empress Sisi would have left straight away after seeing this run down place. Since the owner of this place has changed very often, there is not a large amount of original furniture left. Anyhow, the garden with the Achilles statue is gorgeous, don't miss that one! The view over Corfu town is amazing.  A small remark: Driving up to the town is a bit of a hassle since there are many touring busses going up, the best is to use the free parking ( sign to the left). It s a bit of a hike to get up, but is less of a hassle than parking next to the street. The queue was ok, but still large groups from cruise ships were pushing in front of the line. 10 euro with an audio guide is decent, but handing in my ID for an audio guide made me feel uncomfortable. I also didn't use it since there were ways too many people in the building. I can recommend reading about the villa online before or afterwards."
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Interestingly beautiful,"If you like history, architecture and amazing views this is the place to visit. At 10euros it's definitely VFM with its wonderful artefacts and statues of Achilles. Then along with the great views it makes it a must to visit. Nice little place outside too to get a drink as you walk round."
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Old Palace,The old summer palace of Princess Sissi of Austria. It is now a museum with lots of the original furniture and features. A great history and well worth having a guide explain all the facts. Top floor once used as a casino and used in a Bond movie. Has a massive statue of Achilles in the wonderful gardens.
"October 19, 2019",5.0,Highlight,Beautiful house and gardens with some stunning vistas. Suggest an off peak visit to get good photos. Few areas look like the are damaged and I hope renovation and protections is planned.
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Loved Palace and Gardens,"The Palace and gardens are stunning n The cost to get in is fair. We got off the bus 2 minutes from the Palace entrance. Stalls selling souvenirs, drinks and snacks- toilets too. A good view whilst we ate our sandwich. Spent at least 2 hours wandering around. Plenty to see. The view from the very end of the garden is amazing. You can also watch the aeroplanes coming in to land. Fortunately we finished by about 2pm as when we came out there were at least 12 coaches dropping off and picking up visitors along the narrow streets. Definitely worth a visit"
"October 17, 2019",4.0,Sissi‚Äôs holiday home in Corfu,"This palace is probably the highlight of my visit to Corfu. It is not very large and can be visited in one hour but the palace, paintings and furniture are all hand made especially for the empress and are worth visiting. The web site is poor with limited information. I could not see the opening hours or the price on the web site. It costs ‚Ç¨10 per adult or if you are in a group of 14 or more the price is reduced to ‚Ç¨6 per adult. The audio guide is free but there is a long queue and you have to leave your passport or driving licence as security for the audio guide."
"October 15, 2019",1.0,Poorest of the Poor Customer Service,"If you are a private person trying to see the Achilleion Palace, you will not be treated well and are at the mercy of the apathetic ticket staff. Many buses started dropping off visitors. Guides with groups kept cutting the line. As we finally reached the ticket window after a long wait, a guide giving a tour to Group 9 from the Norwegian Pearl, cut in front of us and we asked her if we could please finish getting our tickets and she basically told us, too bad, we have priority!! It made us so upset, we didn't enjoy the tour."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,Nice Palace and Gardens,"A nice small palace with beautiful gardens and magnificent views. Nice from the outside and has some art inside, and historical re presentations of how the rooms looked like."

"October 13, 2019",5.0,Lovely place,Very beautiful gardends and statues. The view is amazing. Is definitly a must if you are visiting Corfu.
"October 12, 2019",4.0,Interesting place with lovely views,This is worth a visit and there is plenty of information about its unusual history. The audio guide is good and without it you will miss some interesting tip bits about the Austrian royal family and their strange sad lives..
"October 11, 2019",4.0,Nice,It was raining so being indoors was welcome. A group of 14 gets you entry for ‚Ç¨6 otherwise pay ‚Ç¨10. Nice gardens and statues outside so have a brolly if it's raining. Loads of paintings etc to see inside.
"October 10, 2019",4.0,Beautiful views,"I visited this palace many years ago when you could only visit the gardens and a very small part of the house. It was good to go back now the house is fully open.  The house itself is beautiful and interesting to walk around despite the fact that most of the interior is a reproduction.  The highlight for me was the garden full of statues. Really beautiful and interesting with fantastic views of the island.  Things to note : You can get an Audio guide, but they want you to leave your passport as security. Mine was in my hotel and they wouldn‚Äôt accept other Id.  You can take Bus 10 from Corfu town to get here. It stops right outside. Much cheaper than a coach trip.  There is a small gift shop just to your left as you enter the house. Limited choice, but really nice staff"
"October 10, 2019",4.0,Worth getting up early,Having passed the palace the day before we realised an early start would be good  We arrived in a hire car at 8.10 it opens at 8 and we were the first in the place. Euro 10 each including audio tour. Note from Corfu there are about 30 hairpin bends on the way up and you have to pass what appears to be a no entry sign but just ignore this as just around the corner there are more signs indicating 2 way traffic  Wonderful sculpture and setting up on the hill over Corfu Town and great being the first there audio tour good too  By the time we left at 9.30 there were 10 coaches outside  As this was low season we managed to pay 43 euro for 2 days car hire!!! From Fair Deal a local Corfu car hire
"October 9, 2019",4.0,A bit expensive at ‚Ç¨10 each but still a lovely place.,Not much inside the building in the way of furniture etc. The garden is lovely but a bit sparse and the views are wonderful. It was worth a visit though.
"October 9, 2019",4.0,Beautiful building,"We went in for the Asian art, but surprisingly we enjoyed the building itself and the view around more then the art. If you go in watch out, you might get a stif neck like I did because the ceilings are stunning. Oh the art is very nice to and we stayed around for close to a hour. I believe the entree costs 6 euro‚Äôs wich was well spend."
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Must visit,"Definitely must go there. Parking is free, but it is small. You may need to park alongside road ang go by walk there."
"October 7, 2019",4.0,Stylish and well presented museum.,Whilst on hols on September we used local bus to visit this eye-catching museum. We had audio aids to support the catalogued items that were presented on various floors and gardens the interiors from floor to ceiling are full of interesting well presented relics of the past. Sure much of the interior is a reproduction to the earlier centuries.However this doesn't detract from a wonderful experience. We wanted to buy a souvenir of the day but found none sold in the museum. In fact they were sold in the local shop near to the entrance. Visit here if you like a truly visual experience of the past.
"October 7, 2019",4.0,Island tour,Very good value for money as took in with all day tour and the Palace was just one of the stops. Fantastic views from the Achilles statue into Corfu Town and the bay. Very knowledgeable guide Wouldn't take the kids to this one
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Day out,This place is steeped in history we are actually staying in an apartment near by I thought the grounds were lovely. You get an audio phone which tells you what your looking at. What I did find strange is as you arrive into the gate you dont start at number 1 and your not given a map so you could miss things. Doesnt take long to get round it.
"October 6, 2019",4.0,Worth a visit,"Once it was a place where princess Sisy used to stay. Later it was a private home, hospital, casino.... If you do not manage to go, you won't miss a thing. Beautiful views and charming place. If you travel with young ladies it is a must!"
"October 6, 2019",3.0,Interesting,"The visit was interesting, albeit rushed, and the museum held less than expected. Having said that, the statues are very impressive, and so are the paintings.i would recommend more time, and also to use the audio guides rather than the guides provided, as it is difficult to hear above the noise"
"October 5, 2019",3.0,Overpriced,The garden is beautiful but the museum itself is not much. The ticket is 10 euros - definitely overpriced.
"October 3, 2019",5.0,Fascinating place,Went for the first time in 20 years now the house is open previous visit we were not able to go inside. This visit is well worth the time and entrance fee to see inside to take in the grandiosity of this palace fantastic views across to curculio town and beautiful garden
"September 28, 2019",5.0,"oh Sissi, where have you been..","I don‚Äôt want to go too deep into the History of this Place, The Achillion ‚Äì Summer residence of Empress Elisabeth of Austria. We have Wikipedia for that, right? However, this place is so well preserved, full of sculptures, Documents and Furniture of the days gone by. Especially the twelve muses are so impressive, it is worth the entry fee of 10 euros. The drive to this place is a bit tricky, it turns out that, if you come from the south, the road ends up to be a one-way street and you have to turn back. So, if you want to visit it with your rental car, use the way from north (Corfu town)."
"September 27, 2019",5.0,An unexpected gem,A beautiful mansion and gardens well worth a visit. The statues are amazing and the whole place is elegant. Make sure you get an audio guide.(free with admission
"September 26, 2019",4.0,Pleasant interesting and cool,"Go early before the tour buses.interesting history ,great views from the gardens ,cool places to sit in the gardens"
"September 26, 2019",1.0,Very disappointed.,We visited the Achilleion 14 years ago and were really looking forward to our return visit. But I‚Äôm not sure where the 10‚Ç¨ entrance fee is being spent but certainly not on the house and gardens! In the house bannister finials were missing and the rooms are mainly empty but the biggest disappointment has to be outside. The statues of Achilles and the ballastrades are all in desperate need of cleaning and the gardens were unkempt The wonderful view is getting less clear as trees have been allowed to grow too tall. There were broken steps which were dangerous and to top it all the toilets were very unpleasant too. We will not be going back!
"September 25, 2019",4.0,Well worth getting off the Hop-on Hop-off bus for!,"Having read all the stuff about this place, I'm ready glad we got off the bus to explore it. The only downside was that in order to get the headphones to learn about the place, we were asked for our passport or driving licence. And of course we don't carry them around with us. If they are worried about theft, why not just charge a refundable fee."
"September 21, 2019",4.0,Beautiful History,A great place with alot of history to learn. Clean and maintained well. Easy to follow around and take it in. Beautiful ground with some amazing views
"September 19, 2019",4.0,Interesting Place,"Full of history, beautiful views and artwork. Lots of steps so if you have trouble getting about the gardens and some of the museum will be difficult to get to, but there is a small lift. Worth the effort"
"September 14, 2019",5.0,Great location!,Achilleion Museum is a great stop while on Corfu. As the palace of Sissi and the movie location from the Bond movie For Your Eyes Only it has a nice history. Also use the Audioguide and get a lot of inside tips on all the items in the house. Also the surroundings of the palace are great. This is one of the must do while on Corfu.
"September 14, 2019",3.0,Interesting but lacking,"The drive to and from the Palace are an adventure, entrance is a little pricey, and the staff are not welcoming, take your money and swiftly move you on, then join the que for the electronic guide recorders, to hire the recorder, you have to leave your passport or drivers licence for the duration of your visit, you don't even need to do that to hire a car on the island, the Palace is interesting, and the storys of its history are very interesting, from its occupants to its movie appearances, its worth a visit,"
"September 14, 2019",5.0,Museum Visit,This is a Palace of an Austrian Princess and it is beautifully decorated and fitted out building. It gets very busy with tourists and can be hectic at times to try to see the exhibits and rooms but well worth the wait. It has some lovely gardens to stroll around and guide tapes are available.
"September 12, 2019",3.0,Nothing much,The story behind the artifacts (not too many of them are originals) is interesting if you are lucky with the guide.
"September 11, 2019",5.0,Stunning!,We were recommended this place by staff in the Sugar Patisserie (where we buy our daily bread). It is stunning and well worth a visit.  We got a Corfu City bus to Saroko Square then the number 10 bus to Achilleion. A travel anywhere day ticket for the blue bus cost us ‚Ç¨5.50 each and entry was ‚Ç¨10 so considerably cheaper than an organised tour. The downside is that the 10 bus only goes once an hour. The timetable is on the Corfu city bus Facebook page or google!  The house and gardens are huge and opulent. Lots of interesting artefacts in the house too. Gorgeous statues and impressive views.  It was quite busy in the morning.  We would definitely recommend it.
"September 10, 2019",5.0,Wonderful piece of Corfu history,"The house and gardens are well worth a visit. I would go under own steam by local bus or car. The price includes audio commentary which is quite informative, although some bits brief and to the point. You will need to leave photo id as deposit.  The garden terrace is magnificent and is at the top level accessed from a wonderful staircase."
"September 8, 2019",4.0,Interesting visit,"Interesting visit to a wonderful palace with amazing view. Ticket is actually not really cheap but it worths. I advise the visit, above all in case of not too sunny day as an alternative to seaside."
"September 8, 2019",5.0,Amazing view,"The garden is very beautiful. It is preferable to go in the afternoon, because the morning is very busy."
"September 7, 2019",4.0,Beautiful Palace,"Enjoyed walking round, it was part of a pre booked trip so not sure of entry price. Beautiful things on display to look at. Some of it is ok if you are disabled but there are some steps."
"September 6, 2019",5.0,Nice view,"Very beautiful place. The garden is beautiful with many sculptures and plants but also inside is very well decorated and preserved. The ticket is 10 euros, they have a discount for students (ticket is 8 euros, but make sure to have student card). With the ticket you can ger audio guide inside and there are many different languages. Bring your own earphones, since they do not give them to you. If you don‚Äôt have earphones you can still listen to the audio guide but you won‚Äôt hear very well since there are a lot of people. You only get the audio guide for 1 hour but you can stay inside as long as you want. Overall it is a place woth visiting. If you want to walk to it, there is a path neat Kaiser bridge (there you don‚Äôt have to walk on the road)"
"September 6, 2019",4.0,Definitely worth it,Great tour and excellent gardens worth the visit. Make sure you have transport arranged after the visit as gets busy and taxis are pre booked
"September 5, 2019",5.0,Beautiful palace,Despite the very high temperatures we really enjoyed visiting empress Sissi's summer palace. Amazing building and gardens. Recommended!
"September 1, 2019",5.0,Simply beautiful,"I was quite amazed by how stunning the whole palace was. The outside garden is very well maintained, but don't expect to spend hours there wandering around. The whole property is quite small and you can be easily done with everything within an hour or two max. We went there around 10 am and the place was busy with tours. Since the place is not that big, it was quite annoying having all the tours there at the same time. As an individual traveller, it felt like one had to squeeze past them in every single room. That aside, I think it's worth the visit and the price. If you wish to get the audio guide they provide, be sure to take your ID / Passport with you, as otherwise they won't give it to you."
"August 29, 2019",4.0,I love the place,"The Achilleion was the vacation palace of princess Sissy. The place is amazing, I love the ceiling, the artifacts, the furniture, the gardens. It seemed a little less maintained though since last time i visited a few years ago. Free parking, pretty expensive ticket, long queues sometimes under the hot sun and bad road to get there, but it worths it!"
"August 28, 2019",5.0,Family experience,Visit the palace of princess Sissy with my family and had the tour. A great island the Corfu and I would love to visit again as an adult!
"August 26, 2019",5.0,Nice place,It is a very beautiful castle. The out side garden is well maintained and the view is beautiful. Inside there is a terrace from which you can admire the landscape. The entrance ticket is 10 Euro.

"August 25, 2019",5.0,Nice view,"Close to Pelekas if you have the opportunity to visit it , just go . History will make you feel goosebumps Achileas was great!"
"August 24, 2019",5.0,Well worth a visit,The Achillion Museum was a treat to visit. So much history there with a sense of going back in time. Lots of lovely paintings & furniture to view. I liked the headphones supplied so you could go around the rooms & gardens at your own pace & get all information provided as & when needed. The gardens are spectacular & beautifully kept. For me the wonderful statue of Achilles at the bottom of the gardens was spectacular. A real sight to see. I would definitely recommend visiting this lovely museum.
"August 20, 2019",2.0,Perfect location but not much to see.,"When youstep on the back garden you realize while Sisi chose this part of land to hawe his relaxing home. Unfortubatly was wery crowded by cruising guests from costa. In the rooms are almost no furniture, even miss the photografy how does residence looks like in time when Sisi was here. All the owner leves the trace."

"August 12, 2019",5.0,Nice place to visit,I came here around 5-6 in the afternoon and the temperature was quite nice. Inside they have airconditioning and the place was not too crowded. They offer free audioguides and the entrance fee is 10‚Ç¨. The palace is very nice and it has alot of interesting history behind it. You can also walk in the gardens and experience a nice view. The palace is not that big but it is certanly worth a visit!
"August 10, 2019",4.0,Really a nice venue.,Beautiful works of art and a great story behind this museum - we were on a cruise excursion and didn't stay as long as we would have liked - some great pictures can be taken here of the museum and the city below.
"August 9, 2019",5.0,Usual Museum,"Yep, it's nice, but a really small one. It may be interesting for kids. Morning is the best time - less crowded."
"August 8, 2019",5.0,Must see when in Corfu,"This is a must when in Corfu. The whole palace area is beautiful, both inside and outside. We came here by quad that we could park easily at the entrance parking lot. A ticket costs 10 EUR for one person. What you see here is definitely worth the price. I loved the garden area, it is stunning! The sculptures are beautiful and monumental. Audio guide is included in the ticket price, you can easily spend 1,5-2 hours here."
"August 6, 2019",4.0,Pricey but unique,"20 euros for a family or two adults comes a bit pricey, but audio guides in several languages are invluded. Those not being Serbian, for no apparent reason. Palace itself is huge, well mainted and full of Sissi's personal items and finest pieces of art. For the full tour you will need two hours and audios function for one hour. You will need passports for audios. The palace garden is also ful of sculptures and there are shady places for visitors to rest. It is worth a visit."
"August 6, 2019",5.0,A great place,We had a great time exploring this Palace. It had some interesting items in and was lovely to wander around the rooms. The gardens outside were great with lovely views
"August 5, 2019",5.0,Amazing piece of history,Fascinating trip back in time. Beautifully preserved & stunning to walk around. Interesting historical building. We visited as part of a Tui excursion & though our guide was excellent we only had 25 minutes free to wander around the gardens & palace which wasn't enough time.
"August 1, 2019",5.0,Worth the walk.,"We visited here after an epic uphill trek from Perama on possibly the hottest day of our stay in Corfu.  The palace and gardens are beautiful, with stunning views over the island. There is an audio guide you can collect just inside the main doors to the palace.  There is a gift shop inside the palace, and a coffee shop in the grounds near the exit. However there are also cafes and a shop on the road outside."
"July 30, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place,Beautiful place. It is very nice experience : a combination of history and some modern influence. Really recommended for all.
"July 29, 2019",5.0,"Achilleion Palace built for Empress of Austria, Sisi!","The grounds and the building are very beautiful. The palace was empty after her death, and was sold to the German emperor, Wilhelm II. He made changes and additions to the palace. This palace basically became a museum around 1994, when it was given to the Greek Tourism Organization. Prior to that it had been used as a casino. Many of the original frescoes and paintings wer painted over during many of these changes. Many beautiful statues decorate the grounds. The most stunning decoration is the fabulous view you get from the cliffs of the property. A truly worthwhile visit."
"July 27, 2019",4.0,Lovely afternoon stroll through the museum,Another ‚ÄòFor your eyes only‚Äô quest and the Achilleion did not disappoint. Lovely to see the famous Dying Achilles statue and the black and white tiled courtyard that served as the restaurant location in the movie. They offer an audio tour.
"July 26, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"What a beautiful place. Stunning gardens, lovely statues and so much history crammed in. Really enjoyable day. Reasonably priced for a family and the younger children enjoyed the Greek mythology."
"July 25, 2019",5.0,A Real Highlight of our Holiday - Stunning,"With ID Passport or Driving Licence you can pick up an audio radio in your language.. every Item in the palace is numbered if you want to find out the relevance of an item type in the number. Fabulous Experience well worth a visit. We found everthing stunning, the ceiling paintings, sculptures, views & beutiful gardens. Views Stunning from the local cafe. After our visit on our way back to hotel we took a swim in the sea by kaiser bridge."
"July 19, 2019",3.0,Not all that special,"This is worth a visit as it is interesting but don't expect a lot. The views from the gardens are lovely, the inside is ornate but much of the items on display are not related to the actual house itself. It costs 10 euros which is reasonable but if you want an audio guide you must have a passport or driving licence to leave as a ""deposit"" nothing else is accepted and without the guide it is difficult to understand the history of the palace"
"July 19, 2019",4.0,Interesting,The front of the museum is beautiful along with the hall inside. The railings are beautifully decorated. Some of the ceilings have beautiful paintings. The rooms were a bit of a disappointment as they were quite small and simple. The gardens were beautiful and from the terrace there is a good view of Corfu town & the sea Parking is a problem nearby as well.
"July 17, 2019",4.0,Interesting,"We made a quick visit of just 45 minutes, which was not enough time. There are some interesting artefacts and large grounds to walk around. The entrance fee is 10 Euro with 2 Euro discount for Students and people 65 years +. Some rooms did look a little devoid of furniture and many of the statues could do with a clean ! Other than these minor points, an interesting place to visit, but I would allow 1-1.5 hours."
"July 16, 2019",3.0,Ok,Not bad. Should be better preserved.. had some empty rooms open without any exhibit. At the gift shop they have pos and they can accept cards but the woman working there didn't know how to use it... Really weird.. Anyway the exhibit that were there were great and the palace it shelf is majestic. It is nice to visit but shouldn't be number 1 priority.
"July 10, 2019",3.0,Park your car at the parking below the Achilleion and go up with the stairs!!!!,They made a very spacious parking just under the Achilleion so that buses can drive freely and traffic does not get stuck!!! For locals who need to take the bus it is very frustrating!
"July 8, 2019",5.0,Wonderful palace with gorgeous garden and statues,"We visited Achilleion this July and we higly recommend it to everyone who visit Corfu. This palace is really well maintained and the audio guides were really helpful to get to know all the important details about Sissi's possessions and exhibited items. (Don't forget to bring your ID or passport to get the audioguides).  We really enjoyed walking around the gardens and seeing the monuments of the Muses and the Achilles statues were all stunning. Also the view is very jaw-dropping, would definitely recommend."
"July 8, 2019",2.0,Nice location but not taking care of,"Excellent location. However, garden and villa are not really taken care of. The price (10 EUR per person) is way too much for what is offered. There is a small kiosk in the garden, selling soft drinks. The vender was probably the most unfriendly person I ever met. My daughter (3 years) wanted a Fanta lemon instead of a Fanta orange, but the vendor had already taken the Fanta orange and had to do the job twice...."
"July 7, 2019",3.0,Interesting museum,Visited this museum as part of the Discover Corfu trip. Our tour guide lead us around the museum and explained each section which was useful. I especially enjoyed see ‚Äòachilles heel‚Äô. Worth a visit for some greek history.
"July 3, 2019",5.0,Just wow üëç,"This is absolutely must see on the island, great location, interesting audio guide - in many languages  Tickets per adult are 10 euros  Statue of the Achilles is beathtaking"
"July 3, 2019",4.0,Nice summer palace,"Nice summer palace of hungarian lady Elizabeth, located not far away from Corfu town. Well, it is really worth visiting if you are in to history, Greek mithology or architecture. As an adult you are charged 10‚Ç¨, you can get a discount if you have student license (8‚Ç¨). Free audioguides are included in 10‚Ç¨ ticket. I think a little pricey but nice place."
"June 30, 2019",5.0,Achillieion Palace Museum,Well worth the visit. not for the faint hearted as there is a lot of walking. Beautiful place Lots of history. Fabulous grounds
"June 30, 2019",4.0,Beutiful nowadays palace,"We took so many beautiful pictures. The garden with monuments is so beautiful. Again great view. Inside was little bit boring for me but garden is unforgettabe. Price is 10e for an adult, bit over rated but as its one of must go place in Corfu so worth to visit anyway"
"June 29, 2019",4.0,Visited on a rainy afternoon.,"A wonderful mansion, accessible by local bus lines. The interactive tour was good. Many great reliefs and statues. The gardens were beautiful!!"
"June 29, 2019",5.0,very interesting Palace museum,"A very interesting palace with a fantastic view and interesting murals, statues and other artefacts. Well worth a visit."
"June 24, 2019",5.0,A place must seen,"Amazing museum with gardens , statues and beautiful inside painted walls . Better o visit spring or summer so you can enjoy walking in gardens ."
"June 24, 2019",5.0,The statue of Achilles in the garden is magnificent.,"A beautiful place to visit at any time,but a great way to escape the hot weather and to soak up some history.This palace is well worth a visit and the views from the gardens are stunning."
"June 24, 2019",4.0,Worth a visit if you need some exercise.,Strange to find a small relatively new classical style palace in Corfu. Very popular with coach tours in the morning. It seems coaches mainly operate in the morning as when we left c. 2.00pm there were none around. There is a small discount for over 65 years old. Nice gardens with good views. Some interesting historical anecdotes from late19th/early 20th Centuries. Not to compare exactly with Blenheim Palace but this is Corfu and a good excuse for a few hours wandering about. Note that car parking is virtually non-existent and a one-way system operates as the access road is so narrow with very sharp bends. We were fortunate to arrive on a car's departure otherwise we would have had a very long uphill walk to reach the Achilleion.
"June 20, 2019",4.0,Interesting attraction,"Spent an interesting couple of hours here. Definitely make sure you take photo ID with you (passport/ driving licence) as you have to hand it in to get an audio guide to take around with you (like a little mobile phone - you press in the number in front of the exhibit and then listen to the commentary). The audio guide is included in the entrance fee (8 euros each) and makes the visit worth it as you get e better feel of the past inhabitants of the palace. Gorgeous gardens and statuary, and a stunning view from the far end under the enormous statue of Achilles. There are a couple of cafes and a restaurant nearby, and a winery opposite. An interesting half day- with some hairpin bends on the toad if you drive up the 2k of road from the northern end of Benitses (signposted Goustari and Achilleon. You could combine it with a stop in Perama - Park up and walk over the concrete causeway to the little white monastery on a tiny island - the boats to Mouse Island go from the jetty next to it, and lots of people stop on the causeway to video the planes coming in just overhead to land at the airport - hang onto your hat!"
"June 18, 2019",5.0,scenery,"The views in every direction from the palace gardens and balconies are stunning. The giant statue of Achilles, when standing beneath it is awesome.The palace is just as easy to get to by local bus as it is by a tour bus, and cheaper. Well worth a visit"
"June 18, 2019",5.0,Stunning,"The biggest impact is as you enter through the gates and look up to see a huge, brilliant white colonnaded building set against an azure blue sky, with dark green conifers. It's glorious, and a very large building.  Wonderful to look at inside, it's worth taking an audio guide so you can key in exhibit numbers and get information about them. The statuary in the gardens, especially the large Achilles statues, is amazing. It's worth waiting until later in the afternoon to visit; up until about 1500hr there's a constant stream of coaches stopping to drop off their several tonnes of humanity and it all gets a bit frantic. After 1500hr, they've largely gone.  I'm sometimes a bit blase about museums / stately homes, but this one is well worth a vist. And at ‚Ç¨10, it's a steal. You'll need your camera. As another reviewer said, this isn't an all day thing; we were about 2 - 2.5 hours, and didn't feel we'd missed anything."
"June 17, 2019",5.0,Nice place,"Cost 10 euro for adult. Nice place with well kept furniture and art. Audioguide is included in the price but it's only valid for 1 hour (but its worth it). Take your time and walk around the house listening to the history of the place and empress Sissi, a fantastic woman robbed too early from this life. Recommended!"
"June 16, 2019",3.0,Poor maintenance of the statues,The statues made from marble are getting black and green and interior is getting killed by the square ribbed walls as they are looking for paintings on walls. On the second floor there are only empty rooms with beautiful painted ceilings.
"June 15, 2019",3.0,Interesting but not a full day activity,"Visiting Achilleion Palace is a nice tour, but there is not a lot of time needed at this stop. It is interesting and has a fun history, but not something to spend more than 2 hours on for a place with an interesting town to explore as well."
"June 15, 2019",4.0,Beautiful place,Its worth queuing for the headsets. You need to leave id or passport as security. There is so much history you miss otherwise as the signage is limited and the leaflet basic. Last time I went it was a casino so it was good to look around it all. Some has been painted over as a casino. The views are amazing from the top floor garden. There is an outdoor stairway which is quieter. Both monarchs were part of important ends to European royal families and a lifestyle that has gone forever.
"June 14, 2019",2.0,Cheap teixk,Very beautiful but we paid ‚Ç¨10 each for entry then there was no description of anything only numbers for the audio guide. Audio guide is an extra ‚Ç¨15 Euro but... the kiosk was closed. So we wandered around not really able to appreciate the history of the items. Even had we been able to buy the audio guide ‚Ç¨35 Euro for an hour in a museum seems a bit steep!
"June 14, 2019",5.0,The Palace,"During our toor of the island we visited the place located on the top of hill ,with grade views and you learn a lot about the island history. The entrance fee is 10 ‚Ç¨ per person we visited the palace at 18:00 and no issue to find place for parking"
"June 13, 2019",5.0,Favourite place we visited,We did this place as part of a tui excursion and it was really lovely. We had a great guide who told us all about the history of the place and it was very interesting. Well worth a visit
"June 12, 2019",4.0,Achilleion Palace and grounds,"Part of the island highland tour. Originally built for the Empress of Austria, the location provides a panoramic view of Corfu city to the north, and across the whole southern part of the island. The gardens are well maintained (see photos).  This is currently a museum on the ground floor with a casino on the 1st floor I‚Äôve discovered that the casino scene of the James Bond film for your eyes only was filmed here. Definitely worth a visit."
"June 9, 2019",5.0,Great history leason,"I was all set to just go to the old town but thankfully my cab driver suggested that I take this place in for a visit and extremely happy I did, this is a must see when in the area, although I didn‚Äôt stand in line for the headset I did manage to make my way around the complex and figure out all the monuments and statues, with a minimum amount of time I did manage to get through the exhibits although it would have been nice to have had the time to stand in line for a headset and take my time with all the items that where up for discussion, regrets, not at all, it was just perfect, and would highly recommend this site."
"June 9, 2019",5.0,Amazing!,"We walked from Perama, 3.3 km up hill and back, but it was worth it. 8 euro to visit, we were very lucky as a coach trip arrived at the same time as we did, with the tour guide speaking our language, so we found out a lot of interesting facts, rather than just walking round (audio guides are available though, if you aren't as lucky as us). Stunning place with a beautiful garden and even better views of the beautiful island of Corfu, highly recommended!"
"June 7, 2019",5.0,Something you musn‚Äôt miss.,We took a very pleasant bus trip from Corfu Town past Bourganvillea -clad houses to Achilleion Museum. The museum itself is very beautiful and we found the history surrounding the museum fascinating. Gardens were equally beautiful and views stunning.
"June 4, 2019",3.0,Beautiful location,We were disappointed as we could not obtain the headphones without our passports as deposit!!  Excellent displays on view. Interesting history of the Palace.
"June 3, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"When one thinks about when this palace was built and the WW II impact and the fact that it is intact and some treasures have been found and replaced, this was amazing. A lovely piece of history."
"June 3, 2019",3.0,Not that much to see rather crowded,"We went on an organised trip that gave an hour here so maybe our review would be different if it hadn't felt rushed and crowded. There isn't a great deal to see on the ground floor and most of what is there is either from somewhere else or replicas. The tourist info talks about wonderful gardens, but as a gardener myself I can't say I was impressed. The best things about the Achilleon are the views and statues especially the imposing bronze of Achilles."
"June 3, 2019",4.0,Dont forget documents for audio guide,"A Very nice place. Would definitley recommend to visit for families. The views are spectacular, and there are many delightful historic exhibits. The ticket price for adults is 8‚Ç¨, while for teenagers 6‚Ç¨. Don't forget to bring your documents in case you want an audio guide around the castle that will tell you about the sculptures and other exhibits. To get there, take bus no.10 from Corfu town."
"May 31, 2019",5.0,Stunning Place Beautiful Grounds,As part of a tour round the island of Corfu we stopped in the morning to visit here. The craftsmanship and the attention to detail was amazing. Having a guide explaining each room in so much detail. The statues in the grounds were stunning and the views from the garden unbelievable. It was great just to wander round the place enjoying the opportunity to take some fabulous pictures.
"May 31, 2019",5.0,Very interesting,Take the recorded introduction otherwise it would be rather dull. Great collection and good stories . So take your time. Nice cafe Down the road on the way out.
"May 30, 2019",4.0,Beautiful gardens and views,"We took a trip out of Corfu Town to see the Achilleion Museum. It was quite an imposing building with an interesting history. There were several furnished rooms to see and a very ornate stairs and stairwell area. However the highlight for me was the gardens and far-reaching views, especially up on a terrace to the rear of the palace. It would have been easy to miss as it's not very well signposted. I only knew the area was there because I heard other tourists talking about it. Well worth a visit."
"May 28, 2019",3.0,Overcrowded,Visited few days back and it was sooo overcrowded. First thing - parking is free but you probably won‚Äôt find a close spot because it‚Äôs full of buses. Recommend to come on scooter then it‚Äôs no problem. Entry 8‚Ç¨/person but 6‚Ç¨ for students or seniors. The place is beautiful but as soon as you get inside either you buy this ‚Äúphone‚Äù that will talk you through the whole area or you know nothing. I personally like to read about stuff or have a person to guide so I didn‚Äôt buy and I know nothing about the place...
"May 27, 2019",3.0,nothing special,"way to many tours being done at the same time, making it almost impossible to get around the building. Most rooms barely had anything in them, the gardens were beautiful and fantastic views."
"May 26, 2019",4.0,Great Muserum,"Interesting place to visit. We enjoyed the Museum, but found the gardens even better as the views of Corfu are amazing."
"May 25, 2019",5.0,Classicists Paradise,Amazing place. So beautiful with so much history. It‚Äôs good to go with a guide who explains everything to you though. You can take pictures anywhere. The view over Corfu is wonderful from the gardens as well. There is a shop and a cafe near the entrance.
"May 22, 2019",5.0,Wow! This was just what I was looking for to view the Belle Epoque era of Corfu!,"Beautiful gardens and art work. I could feel Sissi's presence in the rooms. Very interesting audio guide, too which came with the 6E ticket"
"May 21, 2019",4.0,Interesting Palace with a very checkered history.,"Achillion Museum was built on the top of a hill in Gastouri by the Empress of Austria, Elisabeth of Bavaria as a royal Palace in 1870 in the Neoclassical architecture stile. The garden at the top was created by blasting a flat surface with gunpower. To view the Garden, you must first climb four floors up the huge staircase starting in the entrance hall. Unfortunately, the years have not been kind to the place, and its beginning to show its age, and of course Thousands of tourists do not help. The Empress known to her friends as Sisi, was a great admirer of Greek mythology, especially Achilles the hero of Troy. She filled the Palace gardens with copies of famous Greek sculptures, even having one especially made of the dying Achilles pulling an arrow from his heal. Unfortunately, the Empress only enjoyed the Palace for twenty years before a crazy anarchist assassinated her. Germany‚Äôs Kaiser, William II bought the palace from her daughter, and moved her beloved statue of Achilles to another part of the Palace. He then replaced it with a huge ugly eleven-meter statue of a triumphant Achilles, that could be seen miles out at sea. During the Palaces life time it has been many things, in World War I, it was used as a military hospital by French and Serbian troops. In the late 60's early 70's it was the first Casino in Greece. and very popular with Saudi princess and the Jet set.  . TIP: It‚Äôs still worth a visit, but do go early to avoid the crowds, and wear good walking shoes, take a hat and bottle of water."
"May 19, 2019",4.0,Delicate Architecture for Sissy,"You can tell from the interior of this mini palace that it was designed with a woman in mind. The architectural and color details have a feminine vibe to them, making it a very different experience from other palaces in Europe. That is why I highly advocate taking the time to visit. You can probably see everything in about an hour. The striking center staircase wraps around taking you to the third floor which opens to a columned courtyard and surrounding garden, ending with a fantastic view over the sea, where a large statue of Achilles dominates the area. Lots of great photo ops. One odd thing is that they do not let you exit via the way you came in for no understandable reason. Not a big deal as the exit is about 100m from there but the attendant was very adamant about it. Parking spaces were available (in May) but it might be tough in high season. There is a small lot a 2 minute walk from the entrance but there is some street parking if you are lucky (we were)."
"May 18, 2019",5.0,Wow,"We visited this museum on a round the island trip. It is 8‚Ç¨ to get in but so worth it. The palace is beyond beautiful with the most stunning paintings on the ceilings and statues, chandeliers and artefacts.  I was in awe. If I went back to Corfu I would deffo visit again"
"May 15, 2019",5.0,Sissis Palace.,"Beautiful mansion of Austrian Queen Elizabeth! Do not miss it! The inside of the summer palace is interesting, but the garden and general outside view, is awesome."
"May 15, 2019",4.0,Beautiful views,"The views of the area from the Achilleon Museum and its gardens are simply amazing and breath taking. We visited on the 11th of May 19, a sunny day and enjoyed our time mostly spent in the gardens. It was very busy inside the museum and we rushed through it prefering to enjoy the beauty of the building and statues outside. Just for the views if nothing else, dont miss it."
"May 15, 2019",2.0,"Not much to see, but the location","The entrance of the palace is beautiful and the staircase is amazing, the terasse surrounded with statues is beautiful too, but that‚Äôs about it. It was pouring rain when we went there and we were refused to have the guiding tools because t was raining (?!?) there is 0 explanation whatsoever about the rooms or poor pieces of furniture or art present in the castle it was definitely not worth the 8‚Ç¨/person spent..."
"May 15, 2019",2.0,Still confused,"This place could have been great. It's just not organized. If you want a head set device. You need to have a passport or ID card, also the patience of the gods, cause it's definitely a hassle. There is no flow, so it's a free for all. I think it's best if one goes earlier in the day. As be ready for steps as well. The grounds we kept up well, I just baffled with lack of staff in direction. This place suffers from the chill vibe of Corfu. Consider it's namesake, seem to be an afterthought about Achilles."
"May 14, 2019",4.0,Nice place,"The inside was OK, but not a lot to see. Outside was much beter, with great gardens, statuary and views to Albania and mainland Greece. The drive up in the coach is quite interesting too!"
"May 14, 2019",4.0,Lovely palace,We had a good tour guide so the visit was great. Views from the garden are fantastic. Interesting story.Would like to wander the area without being on a tour bus and spend more free time in Gastouri.
"May 12, 2019",4.0,Picturesque place,"Nice place for spending few hours with great scenery, history and archietecture. Good place for the days when weather is not perfect for sunbathing."
"May 12, 2019",5.0,Beautiful neoclassical residence of Empress Elizabeth of Austria (Sissy).,Well worth a visit to this grand mansion a little way out of Corfu town. Magnificent gardens and the very location is truly breathtaking. The staircase leading to the top floor is amazing as is the enormous painting of Achilles dragging the body of Hector through the streets of Troy. It's well worth visiting during a stay in Corfu.
"May 11, 2019",5.0,Loved it - house has step free access but gardens don't,"Achilleion is a palace built for the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, often known as Sisi. The palace is more large villa and the rooms are rather modestly furnished inside. The house is step free, with lift to 1st and 2nd floor, which also includes a garden terrace. There is also an accessible toilet. Achilleion is very beautiful and I think it is well worth visiting, even if the gardens aren't fully accessible."
"May 9, 2019",5.0,Must See in Corfu,"We were in Corfu for the fist time with my wife and were suggested to visit Achillion, the summer residence of Queen Elizabeth. A walk around this huge building and its gardens was truly wonderful. I am a fun of museums and along with the location it was build, its amazing. I wish it could be used also as a Hotel and to be able to stay there..."
"May 8, 2019",4.0,Worth A Visit,We visited the Achilleion Museum as part of our Corfu island tour. The palace was our first stop on a hill. Amazing place to visit and absorb the history. You can also have an audio tour. Definitely worth a visit to see the beauty of the palace surrounded by amazing views of greenery and water.
"May 6, 2019",3.0,Uninspiring,"Great location but unless you are particularly interested in the Empress Sisi it‚Äôs not very inspiring, is very shabby due to poor maintenance and has limited facilities"
"May 5, 2019",4.0,To be visited...!,Beautiful palace mainly the outside area: the garden... you have also nice view of the sea from the hill. to be visited.
"May 4, 2019",5.0,Fit for an Empress!,"Such an impressive building, perched on a hill in Gastouri village. Empress of Austria and Hungary Elizabeth, certainly had style. A 3 storey building with its own chapel, sweeping staircase and frescos . But the best part is when you reach the top and exsit to the garden with its statues dedicated to Achilleas and the stuning views of the beautiful countryside around. Well worth a visit."
"May 1, 2019",5.0,A touch of style and class,"What a beautiful place. It has atmosphere, style, class and history rolled into one, and the setting is second to none. Expensive, yes, but well worth the visit."
"May 1, 2019",5.0,The Empress's summer palace!,"This marvelous villa, painstakingly restored and very well maintained, has been built at the end of the 19th Century by Austrian Empress Elisabeth, better known as ""Sissi"". Definitely worth the visit."
"May 1, 2019",2.0,Much improvement neccessary!,"Location and palace are impressive. However the ticket is rather expensive for an average visitor, discounts theoretically availiable but practically not possible. The official website is absolutely useless, it has not even the opening times. Contact by telephone or mail was also impossible. It still needs a lot of improvement although the ministry of culture and the apparent authorities have got lots of funding with no obvious result."
"April 30, 2019",5.0,Marvellous,"An incredible place, with stunning views of East Corfu. The place, the garden, the interiors are so posh and beautiful that you need to spend at least 2-3 hours. Spend time at the gardens."
"April 23, 2019",3.0,The Palace of SISIy,Near the town in Castouri Built 1891-92 by Elizabeth Emperor of Austria and Hungary planed by the Italian architect Rafael‚Äôs Curtis inspired by the findings art and monuments of the excavation of Pompey The place has turned many hands during the last120 years only few of the original furnitures are in place The garden is very nice especially on spring time Despite all still nice to visit
"April 9, 2019",5.0,Don't miss it!,"Take the time to do the audio tour of the property, both inside the palace and around the grounds. It is spectacular!"
"April 8, 2019",5.0,Glad to have been there!,"It was my first trip in Korfu, some friends proposed to go there. We hiked up to the palace which I can also recommend, just be aware of the cars. The tickets are affordable 6 Euro for students, 8 for adults. At the entrance, there is a possibility to get an audio guide in exchange for ID or driver license. Shame on me, I had both not with me. Inside you will see exhibited objects, letters, pictures from the residents of the palace Empress Elizabeth (Kaiserin Sisi), Kaiser Wilhelm II, ect.. The palace inside is simply beautiful, the more beautiful is the garden though with the huge statue of Achilleion facing the sea side. Totally recommend!"
"April 6, 2019",3.0,Nothing special,"While the palace is magnificent and the view is great, there is nothing else to be excited about. Not only is the ticket overpriced but the building itself does not feel well maintained at all. Not to mention that we were not allowed to go into some of the rooms."
"April 3, 2019",5.0,Achilles Statue,"Beautifully painted ceilings, and an inspiring statue and painting of Achilles are well worth the visit alone , gardens are small but pretty, a must see if your in Corfu"
"March 25, 2019",5.0,Great Tour of Sisi's Palace,"Sisi was happiest in the castle she built in Corfu, from what the tour guide noted. It is beautiful with many gardens to enjoy. My friend and I enjoyed learning more about SIsi as well as seeing a home that totally had her influence in the design. There are English guides available which was worthwhile. I recommend this museum."
"March 6, 2019",5.0,Statues,Museam in pretty village of gastouri belonged to a princess it was her palace then kaiser took it when she died as some artifacts remaining and beautiful statues all around the garden .
"February 21, 2019",5.0,Elegance and beauty,"Very elegant palace in gastouri corfu in a beautiful village .very busy in july and very hot ,we loved the tour and history lesson regarding princess sissy also kaiser"
"February 15, 2019",5.0,A beautiful place,"A perfect Place to visit especially on a rainy day like when we were there. Achilleon is a very beautiful both inside and outside. The palace itself is gorgeous and it's filled with paintings, statues and small details telling stories of the past days. The park and the courtyard with all the statues is an impressive sight. It's very easy to grasp the atmosphere of history here and one can almost see Empress Elisabet herself wandering around in the halls. It's not very easy to reach with a car. The road to the palace is very narrow and in some places very steep and there is not very much parking places. The tourist buses make driving and parking near the palace even harder - so if you take a rental car there, remember to pack patience with you."
"January 29, 2019",5.0,Lovely place for short visit,"We came the museum with not many expectations and enjoyed the visit. Amazing number of art items - sculptures, drawings, carpets, wall paintings, and a long history of the palace makes it a great place to spend few hours. The price is 12 Euros which worth every Cent of it."
"January 25, 2019",5.0,Culture trip,"Nice palace which was home to austro-hungarian Empress, known as Sissi. The interior is rich and we get a glimpse of what her life has been back then. The statue of Achilles is a mighty one and has a nice view over Corfu town."
"January 16, 2019",5.0,More personal than other palaces,"The summer palace of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and later Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany feels more personal than palaces usually do. As a summer retreat it's less formal and heavily themed from an interest in Greek mythology and Achilles in particular. This was our second visit after years and as it was August, there were a lot of tourists. Still, good art and architecture with personal touches, and well worth a visit."
"January 16, 2019",4.0,Achilleo Palace of Sissi,"It is definitely worthy to see...although it is not open whole for public, which is pity. But there's a part of history. You can listen interesting parts of Sissi's life through the audio records on a headphone you will recieve."
"January 6, 2019",2.0,Beautiful yet Sad,"There can be no doubt that the ACHILLEION Palace could have been a great and fascinating place to visit.  Unfortunately this is not the case...The Palace-Villa by itself as a building is beautiful...but disappointingly empty! Everything has been sold or stolen so all the furniture that could revive and tell a story are missing, gone forever!  The maintenance of the building is minimal to poor and as for the lovely gardens it is felt that they are left to their fate, selfprotected by nature. So much to be revived, told and gained but so little has been done. What a pity.  Yet it is still worth your visit just to let your fantasy travel you back to this unreturnable era and grandeur."
"December 23, 2018",4.0,Well worth a visit!,"We went here last October and had a nice afternoon here. The house is a bit run down now, but you can still picture the grandeur. The gardens and grounds were delightful. The only downside to our visit was we were unable to purchase the audio guide as they insisted on some photo ID. As we don't carry our passports around or have no identity cards we had only bank cards. They would have taken a driving licence, but again, we never brought one. It would be helpful in the brochures if this was mentioned. It would have given us more information at the time. We got a taxi there for 25 euros, but there is a bus and we got it on the way back."
"December 16, 2018",4.0,A push along but worth a visit,"with several cruise ship in port visitors are being pushed along by guides through the inside of empress Elisabeth‚Äòs holiday villa on Corfu, which has been stripped of most if not all of Sissy‚Äòs former treasures. The beautiful views from the well maintained gardens with its statues from Greek mythology make up for the not so pleasant tour of the inside of Sissy‚Äòs favorite escape from palace life in Vienna and the nastiness of mother in law Sophie.Queen Victoria during her visit also greatly enjoyed the gardens. A steep path leads down to the ocean, where the emperors yacht lay at anchor. Well worth a visit, if you don‚Äòt mind crowds."
"December 11, 2018",5.0,Great place to visit,"Nicely sized, nicely groomed and attended this museum is just perfect not to overwhelm kids yet give them a taste of history. Beautiful garden with nice views and statues of muses and of course both of the Achilles statues. Both are stunning. We enjoyed it on a rainy day."
"December 3, 2018",5.0,Get Your Greek On,"Great visit if you like Greek history/mythology like Empress Elizabeth. Lots of sculptures to look at, nice gardens, and the huge painting of Achilles is impressive."
"November 30, 2018",5.0,The glorious palace of an empress and it shows.,The museum is in the Corfu palace of the near last Empress of Austria- Hungary. She dedicated it to Achilles and his statue appears everywhere including a very large one in the fine garden which has views to the sea. The palace may have seen better days but restoration is adequate. The rooms are grand and exhibit sumptuous decoration and furnishings. It will be busy as it seems every tourist to Corfu visits it but I enjoyed it despite the mob. Remember to make time for the garden.
"November 21, 2018",5.0,Very nice,8‚Ç¨ per person. Beautiful property and scenic. Palace has lush grounds. About 20 minutes via taxi from cruise Terminal.
"November 16, 2018",4.0,Fabulous gardens,We were unlucky to visit this palace of the Empress Sissi on a day when 5 cruise ships were in to Corfu. The endless photography in the house was offset by finding plenty to see in the gardens. The classical statues are superb and the views wonderful
"November 12, 2018",4.0,Sisi's greek villa,"Went there Nov 2018 cruise excursion, the palace was used as hospital during WWII, so don't expect much in display. At the entrance there's Sisi's statue, inside the most important thing is the 3nd floor painting - which had 2 major flows: Hector (Paris' brother) body dragged by Achilles had no blood nor wounds on him, another flow the chariot wheel was not spinning, it was said the painter later suicide due to criticism. There are 2 Achilles statues, grand standing one commissioned by the German king; dying Achilles commissioned by SiSi. The German king started WWI, he wanted glory, so obvious with his choice of statue."
"November 11, 2018",3.0,In need of renovation and crowd control,"I went along Sept 2018. I was a solo visitor and the first thing that struck me when I got there was the amount of tour coaches. The road was rammed and when I went to the ticket booth the amount of tour groups you would not believe. Once inside the place was packed,you could not move. If you like German history you will love the place, if not then its mediocre. The inside to me needs renovation as it looks tired. The grounds are nice with good views. But if you get there and there are 30 plus coaches outside then dont bother."
"November 5, 2018",3.0,Limited interest but a nice stop for a bus/walk,"We went to the palace on the red bus which was well sign-posted and easy to find. The palace itself is imposing but inside is very disappointing unless you are really interested in the German royal family! The collection seems a bit random, bits and pieces they have found, no real continuity linking the pieces. The grounds are small and dominated by a number of over-sized statues of achilles. That's it basically. There is a small cafe but next door is a private cafe with great views, and the owner makes the best apple pie! The best part of the trip was to take the tour bus back a couple of stops, cross the bridge on foot and then walk back into Corfu Town along the coast road.You get an entirely different perspective of the town away from the tourist old quarter."
"November 1, 2018",5.0,GRAND TOUR OF CORFU,"We visited the palace as part of a tour that we had booked , our guide on the tour accompanied us and gave a very interesting commentary on the palace. Without a guide it would not have been so enjoyable. The gardens and views were amazing as was the palace, would love to revisit."
"October 31, 2018",4.0,Flash pad,This is a very nice place to visit and can appreciate that on a clear day the view would be spectacular. The house is large and well set out. The audio guide was worth listening to at most sites. The scuptures in the garden were larger than life.
"October 31, 2018",3.0,"Worth seeing, but could be so much more","What truly makes this place stand out is the exterior. The mansion itself is stunning and the views and gardens and statuary are spectacular.  On the downside, as mentioned in other reviews, is the interior. For one thing, the crowds were so bad that there were some rooms we couldn't even get into and just weren't worth the wait. And then, once you got into the rooms, there was often not much there. Or, if there was something to see, it was poorly marked/labeled so you didn't really know what you were looking at.  We were lucky in that we had a guide for much of the time and so were able to at least get some of the history and the context behind the place, its history and inhabitants. We also got a little more info about some of the specific objects inside the mansion.  But there was very little information actually posted anywhere so, if you had no guide or did not have the audio, there was no way to know what you were looking at or its significance.  I thought it was interesting to see and worth the trip but I think it has the potential to be so much more. I would definitely recommend having a guide or using the audio-guide (which we did not use, so can't comment on how good it is) so that you at least have some context for what you are seeing."
"October 31, 2018",4.0,A great view and gardens,"As with others, the interior was not as expected. The UK National Trust could help this site significantly with management of parking, visitor numbers, interior decor and furniture and general displays.  The fact that the palace is built up the side of a hill needs to be explained so that the lack of rooms at each level makes sense. The staircase, small chapel and the hall on the top of the hill are the rooms of note that are open to the public. The audio guides take forever to get with deposit of ID and an age to return - you are only allowed 1 hour use!  The gardens and the views across Kerkyra (Corfu town) are spectacular and are alone worth the visit. The statues of Achilles are truly beautiful to behold."
"October 25, 2018",3.0,Worth a visit,"It's a beautiful palace, though I found the inside a little disappointing. The interior was smaller than I thought it would be. The highlight for me was definitely the gardens. I loved the large statues and the views were wonderful. We didn't visit the cafe and I wished they were more souvenirs in the gif tshop."
"October 23, 2018",5.0,James Bond in Corfu.,This amazing place was used in the Bond film For Your Eyes Only and is a stunning place to visit on it's own merits. Lots of history and stunning views. Cafe is useless though.
"October 23, 2018",3.0,Nice visit if you have lots of time in Corfu,All the locals recommended this palace as a must see and it was a bit disappointing to be honest. It is a beautiful palace but not very large and the interior is not very rich. There were crowds of people in most rooms so it was difficult to enjoy the palace. We drove there and parking was a nightmare- its a very long and narrow road to get to the palace with limited side street parking.  Recommend this place if you have lots of time to kill- otherwise wouldn't make this a priority to see in Corfu.
"October 22, 2018",4.0,Visit it in off season!,"Great sample of art deco mixed with pseudo antic greeküòé and lot of money. But it's worth to visit, just stay out of peak hrs in the tourist season, if your aim isn't to wait in line about 30'just to get in. A special Greek spirit add tickets - they are without numbers ,laminated for multiple use and are token away from visitor at entrance. Any bookkeeper or tax inspector should get a stroke instantly just seeing it üòéüòã"
"October 18, 2018",3.0,Take ID if you want an audio guide!,"We visited mid-October and it was still quite busy with several coachloads of tourist, mostly arriving at 11-12 so best to arrive before or after. Entry for adults is 8 euros per adult which includes an audio guide. However, for some reason you have to provide photo ID, such as a driving licence or passport, which you have to use as a deposit, only getting it back when you return the audio guide. Why not just have someone collecting the audio guides at the exit gate instead of all that unnecessary faff? Also, as it didn‚Äôt state the requirement for ID ANYWHERE on their website, we didn‚Äôt have anything they accepted and so weren‚Äôt allowed an audio guide, even though I offered to leave a cash deposit. As there was hardly any written info about anything in the palace, we felt that the audio guide was a must and therefore really disappointing to have travelled there especially and paid our entry, only to be told about the ID requirement too late to do anything about it. Why, oh why not make this clear on the official website? When I raised this with the audio guide lady, she very curtly said she didn‚Äôt know about the website and I should talk to the manager. I tried to do this but was told he wasn‚Äôt available. So be warned. And hopefully someone who works at the Achilleion will actually read their reviews and feedback and act upon it."
"October 17, 2018",3.0,Nothing special,"Visited here whilst in Corfu as an attraction. Different and unique to see, a place to visit but wouldn‚Äôt return, as nothing special. ‚Ç¨8 each entry fee. Nice gardens and cafe. Most of top floor is closed off to staff only. So only 1 floor to explore. Nice views from the gardens at top. Take camera. No signs or directions or where to collect audio gear for audio tour so missed out on that and made our own way around."
"October 16, 2018",5.0,Plenty to see,"Coped well with the coach parties. The Palace and garden are very interesting. The first owner ""Cissy"" was a caracter and a half. Sad the building is not in better repair though."
"October 15, 2018",5.0,Longed for trip,Revisiting again as the last time was 1973. Such an interesting place to view because of the history. Beautiful scenery from balconies.
"October 15, 2018",4.0,Palace and gardens are well worth visiting,"The blue city bus takes you to the palace cheaply.You do not need to go on the hop on and off unless you want to. For 5 euros you can buy a day ticket (on the bus) for any blue bus.The bus takes a different route to and from the palace. On Sundays there are fewer buses. We got off at Paranama on the way back which meant that we did not have to go back to Corfu town againThis is a busy attraction and you need to make sure that you give yourself enough time. It takes about 10-15 mins to queue for an audio tour - free and invaluable- and the same to return. The audio tour did allow you to better make sense of what you were looking at. My only gripe was the expectation that you should hand over your passport or driver's licence to get the gadget. I would have preferred to leave a monetary deposit as I do not think that one should hand over such valuable documents even if she was careful.Toilets were good and there were two sets, one on the left as you look at the building and the other set on the right which were clearly signed up. There can be a bit of a bunfight to get on the bus on the way back so be prepared"
"October 14, 2018",4.0,Worth a visit,We visited this as part of a coach tour. The gardens are beautiful with superb sculptures and a great view. Some interesting artefacts of the Hapsburg Empress Elizabeth who was assassinated. On her death the palace was sold to the last king of Prussia Kaiser Wilhelm2. Again there are many of his possessions and photographs on show. The palace was used in the Bond film for your eyes only. Entry prices seemed reasonable.
"October 12, 2018",4.0,Beautiful Palace and Gardens,Great views back towards Corfu Town from the upper gardens. Very interesting artefacts throughout the palace from the time of Princess Elizabeth of Austria and then Kaiser Bill. Gardens are well maintained (unlike Mon Repos) Was very busy when we were there and there was only one person handling the Audio guides which made for a long queue.
"October 10, 2018",5.0,The most beautiful palace I have ever visited!,"The Achilleion Palace, built for and owned by the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary Elisabeth, also known as Sisi on a top of a hill, surrounded by forest and gardens and looking to the Corfu Town and the Mediterranean see is a magnificent place. The building is beautiful, there are maybe hundreds of statues, sculptures and pictures both outdoors and inside the palace. Greek mythology is well represented, including two major statues of Achilles, who also has given the name to the palace. So many unique pieces of art, so beautiful views, such a special atmosphere!"
"October 9, 2018",4.0,Interesting history.,"Built by Elisabeth Queen of Hungary in 1889 and sold in 1907 to Kaiser Wilhelm 11. There are the remains of a bridge over the main road to the sea (Kaiser Bridge) it was bombed during the war. I was disappointed by the general condition of the property, run down and in need of maintenance."
"October 9, 2018",5.0,a must visit !,A beautiful palace and most amazing gardens built by the Austria Hungarian royalty family . Don't miss a visit there .
"October 8, 2018",3.0,Could be better!,"As with so much in this region, the house - particularly the exterior - leaves much room for improvement. Whilst the architecture itself is not great, the grounds are really quite disappointing. In particular there needs to be judicious thinning and re-planting of the trees in order to restore the views that must have existed originally.  Probably better to visit in the middle of the day when most of the coach parties have departed...."
"October 8, 2018",5.0,Great castle,Nice surprise with documented history and story. Wonderful gardens and surrounding with so many spots to take a picture and enjoy. Take the handcuffs and listen some details about family history.
"October 6, 2018",3.0,Historical experience,"The old palace of Sissy is unique and full of history! The audioguide is included in the price but the lady at the counter was really rude and unpolite, not a good customer service."
"October 6, 2018",4.0,An hour to explore wasn't enough.,"It was an extremely interesting view into how the European royal families were interlinked. (Prince Philip was born just a few miles away). Austro-Hungarian grandeur mixed with Italianate designs. Well worth visiting just for the artwork, particularly that of ancient Greek history,especially Achilles, after whom the palace was named. A huge statue of him in the garden, a famous one of him trying in vain to pull the poisoned arow from his heel, and an enormous painting of him at Troy. Quite a way out of town, but on the hop on hop off city tour bus route."
"October 5, 2018",5.0,A visit we had been planning,This is an amazing place opulence at its best my hubby and I do lots of walking. We stayed at Corfu Holiday Palice Hotel. It‚Äôs Central for walking and crossed the causeway then turned left. Road isn‚Äôt great but when you get to sign for Alexandros Hotel turn right. Just walk (about 45 minutes from hotel). Water is required!
"October 3, 2018",4.0,Beautiful House in Stunning Location,"Enjoyed our visit to this lovely house, views were spectacular and the guide was great filling us in with the History. Do not expect to see a house full of antiques it is quite empty, but would still recommend the visit."
"October 3, 2018",3.0,Quite interesting,"It is worth a visit to see all the bling and decorations, but is very much orientated towards German visitors. The gardens were rather disappointing."
"October 2, 2018",4.0,Lovely house.,"This is a beautiful house which is well worth a visit. Did this with a tui excursion, book with Olympus travel in town, same excursion and a lot cheaper, disgusting mark up by Tui."
"September 30, 2018",4.0,Worth a visit,The views from the garden were absolutely stunning. Majestic building with visible history. Not in the best condition though. Overall loved walking around the site and well worth the (small) entrance fee.
"September 30, 2018",4.0,Interesting Palace if I knew what i was looking at!,Our visit was unfortunately marred by the fact that they had run out of audio guides so we had no idea what we were looking at during our visit. Had to research when i got back to the hotel and wifi - wish i had the advantage of the information while we were there. It is a beautiful property with an interesting history. Well preserved and worth the visit - but maybe research before you attend in case they run out of radio guides again.
"September 30, 2018",3.0,"Ok, bad condition",The villa is in a very bad condition (like everything in Corfu). Very poor interior. Second floor is not open for visitors. Really pity
"September 29, 2018",5.0,Majestic and yet little for Royal standards,"A beautiful, large house with about 50 rooms. Built by Empress Elizabeth of Austria (Sissi), construction completed in 1889, year of the suicide of her son. It would be bought by the Kaiser. The theme of the house is Achilles. Two statues of him Achilles dying of the empress; Kaiser's triumphant Achilles. Dark furniture from the empress;light furniture of the Kaiser. Two tragic personalities, opposed and united by the ownership of this property"
"September 27, 2018",4.0,Nice to do; great views,"Built by Elizabeth, Empress of Austria, this was her Corfu retreat. She was assassinated by Italian separatists (can‚Äôt remember when) and the house was acquired by Kaiser Wilhelm - so bears much of his influence. It‚Äôs not a grand place, but it was a pleasing visit, the gardens giving great views over Corfu. Entry is 8 euros ....6 for EU citizens over 65 so that little discount won‚Äôt be troubling Brits after Brexit...unless of course there‚Äôs a break out of sanity and we ditch the whole dumb idea and throw Boris and Michael Gove in the Tower for lies to the British people and subversion of our democracy. There‚Äôs a free audio guide available - but an original photo ID is required..so original passport or driving licence. The numbered stops for the audio seem a tad random and easy to miss, but that‚Äôs all part of the fun. Accessible from Corfu town on a number 10 bus (about 25 mins journey, some of it along a steeply climbing road with hair pin bends) . I don‚Äôt know the return journey cost, probably about 3 Euros, but if you‚Äôre coming in by bus from somewhere else a handy tip is to get a 5 Euro day ticket that gives unlimited travel on the blue buses. Be aware that the bus can get very crowded....standing room only on both out and return legs of the journey, and it‚Äôs not that frequent so best check the timetable for both out and return. On the return there‚Äôs an irritating 2 hour gap between the 15.30 and the next and penultimate return at 17.30. I think the taxi will charge 20 Euros!I‚Äôd describe this as a nice-to-do for those who like this sort of thing...probably not so great for families with kids who would prefer to be on the beach."
"September 25, 2018",5.0,What a interesting place to visit and great views from gardens,A really interesting place to visit .had the tour with guide and it was very very interesting information .Built in 1889-1891 by the empress of austria and her story was very interesting .GO and find about the whole story YOU will enjoy .
"September 25, 2018",4.0,Best attraction on the island,"This is one not to miss. The Palace has an interesting history and a great view from the gardens, which has some impressive statues. It gets very busy especially if there are a number of cruise ships into the island, we were only allowed the audio headset for 50 mins so it felt a little rushed. So we wandered around the grounds afterwards. Don't expect too much furniture in the palace, but it's certainly one not to miss."
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Very beautiful place,"Very beautiful place, worth to visit. We arrived by car, it was not easy to find a parking place. The palace has a beautiful view to the ireland and to the sea."
"September 23, 2018",5.0,Wow: Amazing place with amazing history/ sights,"First stop on my grand tour of Corfu. The palace is a lovely building with interesting history, artefacts and amazing views. I enjoyed my visit but would have liked to spend longer than the 1 hour my tour allowed."
"September 23, 2018",4.0,Stunning views - stunning building,"We fancied seeing more of the island. On looking up on trip advisor we decided on this place. Up some twisty roads you finally get to the location ontop of one of the hills. Parking was free, we decided on parking along the road side as some people decided to dump their cars on the little carpark making it hard for others to get on and off. Paid ‚Ç¨8 Each. Friendly Staff on the gate to direct you. Once inside you can collect your FREE audio device with id such as driving licence or passport. What was good we managed to hire 4 sets under one ID. Only complaints were that we were only given a hour to use the audio device (longer was needed) we found ourselves rushing around and missing the front garden area. Once upstairs there were no audio guide on what rooms you were in which was very disappointing. Be useful a number on entering the room to tell you what the room was used as. Some stunning sights and the views from the garden were amazing. Toilets nice and clean, good access around the palace. There are lifts for anyone who Can't manage the stairs. Was good value for the money especially if you use the free audio guide."
"September 20, 2018",4.0,Achilleion Museum a must when visiting Corfu!,Not visiting the Achilleion is like not visiting the Acropolis in Athens. A must to your visit to Corfu.
"September 20, 2018",4.0,Beautiful Palace. Photo I D required.,"First and foremost, if you visit here take photo I D as without it you will not be able to get the audio guide which is included in the price of the ticket. This was the only element which marred an otherwise lovely visit to a beautiful and interesting place. You can easily get here from Corfu town on public transport and by so doing will save a significant amount of money!"
"September 19, 2018",4.0,Not to miss in Corfu,"If you like a bit of history - you must see this place. Indeed passport or ID is needed to get English guide, but you would check that before you visit. I found it very interesting. Beautiful place."
"September 18, 2018",5.0,Excellent museum/house to explore,We had a great afternoon at the Achilleion. We went by Corfu bus (No 10) from the centre which runs hourly but can also be reached by car or the hop on/off bus. Set on a hill outside Corfu their are wonderful views back to Corfu Town and the coast. The audio guides make for an informative and interesting tour of the house and gardens (lasts about an hour). The statue of Achilles is great!
"September 18, 2018",4.0,Lovely Evening Excursion for good value,"We came up to the Achilleion at around 5pm and had a lovely couple of hours at the museum. The ceiling and stairwell art work is beautiful, but my favourite part was the courtyard with statues of the muses, where there is a cafe to enjoy a refreshment, and the impressive statue of Achilles which overlooks a beautiful view of Corfu. The tickets cost ‚Ç¨8 per adult and I think this was good value."
"September 18, 2018",3.0,Beautifull park with views.,Achilleion is a neo classistic chateau opposite Mon Repos in god condition. Perhaps the german imperor is more belowed than the former king of greece. The palace it self is not a master piece. But there is af beautifull collection of statues. Mostly i will recommend the beautifull park close to the sea..
"September 17, 2018",4.0,Worth visiting if in the area,"This is a really interesting place to visit, the tour goes into the long history and the artwork is amazing.The gardens have some magnificent statues to see and fabulous views.There are toilet facilities, souvenirs and cafe facilities on site."
"September 16, 2018",4.0,"iWas there, finding art, Achilles and the shadow of Sisi","narrow roads, free parking but tough to find, crowded place - but is is a must to visit in Corfu nice place built for a nice lady, the Empress - in respect to local culture, the mark of the place is Achilles, the Trojan hero art, gardens, flowers and nice views over the sea and the island rest for a while and have a coffee , enrich your eyes with those imperial places - it's true that a certain moment that mansion served as a casino, but nowadays the place regained it's glamour"
"September 15, 2018",3.0,Day trip to visit,"We saw is on the way to the hotel and decided to pay it a visit. To be honest it is nothing more than a Victorian Foley, a bit of a nothing really, once a hotel then a casino now a musem of sorts, worth a look, but nothing special"
"September 15, 2018",5.0,Top in the top,"It is at the top of a hill not far from Corfu. The view is extraordinary in many directions, especially from the upper level terrace. It has some interesting paintings and only a few of the old furniture are kept. It's worth visiting"
"September 15, 2018",1.0,Save your money!,"If you are interested in getting squashed between busloads of tourists in the rooms of this palace, go for it! If not, save your money. Commercial exploitation at it‚Äôs worst. Terrible‚Ä¶"
"September 15, 2018",5.0,Busy but worth going,"Be prepared for just how crazy this place gets, particularly if you're driving and not on a coach. The place is fantastic though, with beautiful grounds that you can spend a whole day in so take snacks with you, as the restaurants nearby are really touristy."
"September 15, 2018",4.0,Achilles Palace,"Beautiful art and amazing history, set in the mountains close to the centre of Benitses. Guided tour for 15 Euros, lovely afternoon out"
"September 14, 2018",5.0,A beautiful palace,This was an interesting and beautiful palace. We only needed an hour there but glad we went. Good views as well as audio tours. There were fine frescoes and the price was reasonable.
"September 13, 2018",4.0,Very beautiful castle,It's a very nice castle and well maintained. Not too crowded. A challenging drive up there with some bisses crossing the narrow roads but worth it!
"September 12, 2018",3.0,SO promising but left me feeling a bit vacant. Like the house.,"The architectural elegance is undeniable and the front facade is extremely welcoming. After getting my recorded English guide to the number plates in each room, I was hopeful of what was to come. I love history and Sissy is of course, one of the great tragedies of the era. She was an icon of her time and stunningly beautiful, married the highest man in the land and was wealthy beyond reason. She HAD this house built-it was HERS. So it was a surprise to me that the first couple of rooms had some religious items which I didn't particularly find intersting. Then it was disappointing. Room after room was empty bar a few display cabinets with some references to her but literally, looked like the place had been gutted, pillaged or ransacked at one time or another. The gardens were lovely and looked after. The things they couldn't remove, such as that view to Corfu town, thankfully have been permanently fixed the place and so worth it for that. Views to Albania, inspiring. Views north to the highest point on the island, invigorating. The story of the bench/balcony where she mourned the death of her son, very moving. There are little treasured moments to be found here, but you must allow for the time to mine them out."
"September 10, 2018",3.0,Disappointing,"From my research about this place before my holiday I had thought that I could spend hours here in the gardens. Sadly, that is not the case. The gardens are actually very small and I was told that the best time to visit is Spring as when I was there it was September and the flowers were not at their best. The view is quite good. The museum - not so much."
"September 10, 2018",4.0,Palace with fantastic view,"The story of Empress Elisabeth and Achillion Palace you can find on internet. It is very interesting. The palace is very beautiful and the view is you worthy for the empress. Everything - the palace, garden, fresques, statues and the small details are beautiful with Hellenistic flavour.  But‚Ä¶the place is busy, too busy. It is not possible to enjoy everything because of hundreds of tourists. Also there is not enough parking lots for all the busses and cars. The roads to the palace from the both sides - north and south are narrow, as usual. All the busses travel from north to south (no places for U turn). My recommendation is to drive with the bus stream. There are road signs that forbid to go to the palace from the south (Mpenitses) but nobody cares. To be honest - signs are confusing.  These who likes the Greek mythology and the story of ancient Greece like the empress, and the gorgeous view should go there."
"September 10, 2018",5.0,worth a visit for the stunning staircase,this was on my husbands must visit list while in Corfu Great large building with some what empty rooms but it is used for other occaisons and not just used as a museum Stunning garden with the most amazing statue of Achilles The history to why this palace was built is amazing Didn't think the entry price was too expensive ( have been to far more expensive entry sites here in the UK) What really amazed me most was the staircase with a great painting Parking not to bad as we found a space in the free car park There is a caf√© nearby with views to die for but a poor menu well worth a visit
"September 8, 2018",4.0,Visit in the afternoon,"Sissy palace-as known by the public. Nice building, but a little bit empty.We were expected more items to see in a museum."
"September 7, 2018",4.0,Beautiful ceilings and garden,"The garden and the views from it are the best features of the palace. Apart from the beautiful ceilings and staircase, the interior didn't impress us much. Helped with your imagination you could picture how the interior might have looked back in the day, but now it's mostly unfurnished and we didn't spend too much time in any of the rooms. It's worth a visit though, but I think $8 is too pricey for what you get."
"September 7, 2018",5.0,"Lovely palace, mental parking","We arrived early and had a lovely time walking around the palace and grounds, my wife listened to the audio tour but I didn‚Äôt. Was a very interesting place, as we were nearing the end of the trip the place started to get busy, on exiting we saw the reason. There were 5 coach tours that had arrive, the coach driver had parked behind the cars blocking everyone including us in and disappeared. So we went for a frappe down the road, 90 min later and one of the drivers had returned and sorted out the shuffle. Park away from the entrance and walk up the hill, it‚Äôs quicker overall. :)"
"September 7, 2018",5.0,Great Attraction,Really interesting sculptures and our guide was brilliant and full of information about the history of the palace
"September 4, 2018",4.0,Nice and busy,"Nice palace, with great views from gardens. Not too much to see inside though the entrance and stairs are amazing. Gets very busy, and parking is difficult to find at peak times but generally worth a visit"
"September 4, 2018",5.0,"Amazing views, beautiful interior","Visited in September- good time since less heat and less crowds. Had a pleasant stroll along the rooms and garden. My view it‚Äôs more enjoyable to come without a tourist group - self paced walk gives not only the info, but the feeling of the place"
"September 3, 2018",2.0,Historic visit,Not too much too see. Empty room whithout any furniture or something else. There is no book or tanslation device.
"September 2, 2018",5.0,"Unforgettable! Breathtaking views, exquisite architecture and design. Great value!","Achileon Palace is a must see when visiting Corfu. It's architecture is as captivating as its story. This Royal Residence is unrivaled in beauty and the sheer number aesthetic pleasures fascinates and excites even the least passionate observer. Greek philosophers, muses and ancient mythology are mingled with modern history and Royal splendor. The building itsel is exquisite from every angle. The views will leave you breathless. All off this for the modest sum of 18 euro for a family of three. If I went back to Corfu I will definitely be revising this oasis of beauty."
"August 31, 2018",4.0,Well worth an hour of your time,"We visited the palace and strolled around it. It's gorgeous and pretty well maintained. We did not carry an ID with us so could not pick up the free audio tour. Be sure to bring your ID to enhance the experience!  Nevertheless we enjoyed the rooms, the outdoor, the view over Corfu town and especially the staircase."
"August 31, 2018",4.0,Worth visiting,Truly something you would like to see if you like old Greek buildings. Very nice exterior and interior of the house. You can buy drinks and souvenirs inside. They are really cute.
"August 31, 2018",3.0,Its ok,"Went with our 2 boys- there were lots of large tour groups which made it very difficult to get around the palace. Beautiful setting and views, palace is very grand but nit much to interest children - recommend for adults really."
"August 29, 2018",4.0,Worth a visit,We went here as part of the Tui tour and I felt it was a bit rushed. I enjoyed the garden with lots if statues. They handed us headsets to listen to the tour guide which was a good idea as you can hear her even at the back of the group. I wanted to take more information in as we walked around the rooms so I suggest coming here on your own.
"August 29, 2018",3.0,Nice Villa but nothing really astonishing!,"The Achilleion Museum is nice, but not the kind of museum you expect to visit. Some historical information on the audio guide are not correct. The personality of the Princess is described romantically, but from many biography she is not exactly like that. The Palace is nice, a 800 building with many peculiarities that can refer to Liberty Style. The Achilleion statue doesn't compete with the statues you find in Athens museum, no proportions. The views around the palace are astonishing, nature wins on man's production."
"August 28, 2018",5.0,Gorgeous location for such an historic spot.,My entire family really enjoyed touring Sisi‚Äôs Palace (even my 14 year old who is easily bored by anything hinting of educationally interesting). The terrace on top with the amazing views were our favorite spot.
"August 27, 2018",4.0,a great visit,"I really enjoyed this tour and leaning about Empress ""Sisi"". The museum and grounds are impressive and worth the visit. A guide is important."
"August 27, 2018",4.0,Visit to Achilleion,"Well worth a visit to Empress 'Sisi's place and terraced gardens at every level of the palace. Stunning panoramic views around the east coast of Corfu and the Albanian Coast beyond.  The rooms are well-maintained, but a bit sparsely furnished. Nevertheless a good representation of a 19th Century summer palace, with a lot of interesting memorabilia and portraits."
"August 26, 2018",4.0,Free audio guides to learn about the history,Why not visit the place! Can be reached by a half hour walk up the hill from the beachside road. It is a beautiful place and provided free audio guides to allow oneself to enjoy the visit to fullest.
"August 24, 2018",5.0,Beautiful location,"We visited the Achilleion Museum yesterday, on our last day in Corfu, it was a beautiful experience, fabulous views from the gardens and a delightful palace. My daughter is studying Greek Classic literature at school and we had a good time identifying the various statues of the Greek gods."
"August 23, 2018",5.0,Outstandingly beautiful palace,Wow! This was brilliant with a wide variety of the Greek sculptures and history which is not so easy to find.Very beautiful. We took the city bus to get there which we have found quite dependable even with slkightly varying timings. CONSIDERABLY cheaper to get to (and not trciky) than some obvious tour busses.Back to the palace - worth the visit!!
"August 21, 2018",5.0,Beautiful place,Really nice museum.it was a bit crowdy when we came in the middle of the day.stunning garden with beautiful views
"August 21, 2018",5.0,Amazing!,"Stunning views and one of the most beautiful summer palaces! Wonderful sculptures that reveal Princess Sisi's admiration and love for Ancient Greece. I loved the very big painting upstairs (The Triumph of Achilles), the Dying Achilles (Achilleas thniskon) sculpture in the gardens and of course the huge sculpture of Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens. Make sure you wear a hat especially during the sunny summer days! Toilets are located outside the palace and are very decent. Also there is a small canteen outside for refreshments. Feel free to take photos."
"August 20, 2018",5.0,Lovely,"Wordenful. The fianc√© and I enjoyed visiting this museum. The garden is beautiful, soothing and relaxing"
"August 16, 2018",4.0,"A wonderful fusion of Teutonic pomp, Greek mythology and Mediterranean charm","This is well worth a visit as it captures Sissi's desire to flee from the stuffiness of Viennese pomposity and indulge her passion for Greek mythology. Sadly, much of the elegance is missing in that many rooms are unfurnished, the beautiful clocks have no hands and the gardens outside the main visitable area are somewhat neglected. The audio guide was a little bizarre in that accounts of different rooms and artefacts would be punctuated with irrelevant non sequiturs; it also ran out of battery as one reached the top floor, requiring the dedicated audio guide buff to traipse down the elegant stairway to reception to get a new guide. Despite all that, a visit without the audio guide is incomplete."
"August 13, 2018",4.0,Beautiful views,"Fantastic palace, lots of history. Easy to get to by coach or car. Price not too bad, cafe on site as well as a few tavernas nearby. Great for all ages!"
"August 13, 2018",5.0,Wonderful piece of history,"If you have the chance, don't miss Sisi's palace. The place has an amazing story, awesome view over the island and it is packed with history and emotions. Take your time there, it's only 5 euros to visit - it's worth every cent."
"August 11, 2018",3.0,Visit of the palace,"A bit too expensive for a short your. Of course it is beautiful, but not as big as we expected......"
"August 9, 2018",4.0,Solo visit,So happy this was part of my island tour trip. Beautiful palace. Full of history and artefacts. Glorious views and sculptures in the gardens.
"August 7, 2018",4.0,Good value,The gardens are really wonderful and the house is interesting. Audioguides available in multiple languages and a little cafe. For EUR8 it's good value for money and can keep you busy for a couple of hours.
"August 7, 2018",5.0,Marvelous,"The place presents not only great interior but mostly fantastic gardens. they offer audio guide which is helpful in sightseeing . You will end around 1,5 h."
"August 7, 2018",5.0,Very nice museum,"If you have spare time and are looking for a museum, the building very nicely shows how royalty, Empress Elisabeth of Austria (known as 'Sissi') and Kaiser William II of Germany spent their time in a beautiful building. The Achilles statue in the garden is very impressive by both its size and location. Voice tour is a must (but I doubt one hour is enough to hear all 60+ stories). It gives a lot of background information on various items and locations. Some items however are moved to Vienna after Sissi's death."
"August 6, 2018",4.0,"Pretty location, great grounds, worth a visit.",We visited later in the day so the place we starting to get crowded. Building like most in Greece could use some care. We spent most of our time outside taking photos as it overlooks the lover valley and sea from up on a high hill.
"August 2, 2018",1.0,Audio guide ID,"I visited the museum and paid 8Euro entrance fee. Upon entry to the he main building I attempted to get an audio guide which would inform me of the points of interest. Sadly, I was not carrying my passport or driving license (why would I?!) and therefore was unable to provide the necessary ID to obtain the guide. There were no maps or paper guides and therefore the visit was somewhat wasted."
"August 2, 2018",5.0,Museum and gardens devoted to Achilles,"Built towards the end of the 19th century by Empress Elizabeth of Austria and later owned by the Kaiser the palace and grounds are devoted to Achilles.. Inside the palace is dominated by a magnificent stairway inspired by the Trojan war. The terraced grounds are well laid out and full of statues, including a massive bronze of Achilles Triumphant at the seaward end of the terrace."
"July 31, 2018",5.0,An outstanding tribute building to a Trojan hero,"This palace may be from the time of Empress Sisi of the Hapsburgs but the highlights are all related to her hero - Achilles - the heroic painting in the stairwell of him towing Hector's body around Troy, a statue of him pulling the arrow out of his ankle in the garden and, best of all, a massive statue of him helmeted and holding a spear and looking out of a cliff over the rest of Corfu below. This palace is full of over the top treats like this. Suspend your taste meter and just enjoy the celebration from another time when the classics were in vogue. Lovely colour designs inside - the stairs are a delight."
"July 30, 2018",5.0,A true palace!,"Achilleion was the palace of Empress Sissi, and it was named after her favourite Greek hero. The lush garden is perfect for a walk, and the palace itself is so rich and sumptuous that visiting it is a n unforgettable experience. A strong point is the audio guide, available in different languages and included in the price of the ticket. You can plug in your earphones and wander around the palace and its garden while listening to the info. And the view of the sea? Breathtaking! Not to mention the magnificent statues."
"July 29, 2018",3.0,Impressive but needs care,Impressive that so Many years ago that somebody had the will and power to build such grand things If you are in the neigborhood you should see it. It is/was beatifull and the old pictures you can see shows the years of history We did not take a guide tour just wanted to see the place
"July 26, 2018",5.0,Fab palace,Just amazing place the view from the palace. Great info on the radio phones. Beautiful painting on the ceilings also.  Worth a visit
"July 24, 2018",5.0,Audio guide recommended,Take a walk through the beautiful palace and its surroundings while exploring its colourful past. Be sure to take the audio guide since it adds a lot to the experience of this meeting place or historic storylines.
"July 23, 2018",5.0,historic museum,"plenty of history in this place,lovely paintings fab views,cool marple floors,this is were they filmed for your eyes only 007, breath taking views over corfu town,steve and sue 2016."
"July 22, 2018",4.0,"Over the Top, but atop the World ...","The Achilleion Museum (and palace) is worth a look -- we got there at the end of the day (bus service concludes around 8:30 pm, during the summer), and did manage to spend an hour there before we were ushered out. It's an ""excessive"" kind of place, but with a great history, and the views are beyond stellar looking back at Corfu Old Town. You can get there on the bus, or via cab, and the sight lines are great. The artwork ... that's up to you, I'd have to say; it's the history and the attempt to create a monument that really make it memorable."
"July 21, 2018",4.0,Trip out and tour round,"Good place to walk around, learn and pick up info on some local history. Fantastic views which will blow you away!"
"July 20, 2018",5.0,one of the most beautiful places on Corfou,"We visited the Achilleion Museum without guide. You receive a audio guide or you stroll through the palace. You can now go upstairs, the painting are very special. The out side gallery with the beautiful statues, the garden terras and the outview is very impressing. A must on your Corfou program! There is also a nice outdoor restaurant aside."
"July 19, 2018",5.0,Wonderful palace and great history!!!!,Fascinating building with great history! The exhibits were interesting. wonderful gardens. stunning statues and views. one of the cultural highlights of the islands. Great palace and amazing gardens. Wonderful palace and great history.  Yehuda Shemesh Beit-Shean ISRAEL
"July 18, 2018",3.0,Achilleion Palace/Museum,"I was expecting more from this place. I think maybe I didn't read the description of this excursion very well before visiting this particular location. I thought I was visiting a palace, but it is basically a semi-up kept old house with a few artifacts in a few rooms. We had a guided tour, which was helpful to learn about who lived here and about their life. For me the best part of visiting here were the statues of Achilles outside behind the museum."
"July 18, 2018",4.0,Very nice place,"For 8 EUR you get an entrance fee and you can borrow a head set to listen for an hour about Elisabeth of Bavaria (Sisi) and her palace. It is very nice to come here. I would recommend to come here in the morning (opening hours are from 8 am), when is it less crowded."
"July 17, 2018",5.0,Lovely day,This is a beautiful fascinating building with great history the exhibits were informative and interesting. Access was good and not too expensive
"July 14, 2018",4.0,Worths the visit,"More than a palace, great history around that place. Pick self guided tour, helps a lot. Very impressive statues, wonderful gardens. Long lines to enter, 8‚Ç¨ ticket."
"July 14, 2018",5.0,"Free audio guide, good insight","Beautiful, building and garden. The audio guide is fantastic. A lot of the building is closed off. But the garden is beautiful, with stunning statues and views and the audio guide really takes you back in time. One of the priceier attractions but worth a visit. Quite busy, with busloads of guided tours..."
"July 12, 2018",5.0,Stunning,"Th Achilleion Palace is truly spectacular. Not just for history buffs, there's something for everyone. Theres something interesting in every room and the gardens and views are amazing. There's a little shop in the grounds selling drinks and snacks but there are some lovely little restaurants nearby. The restaurant to the left of the palace as you go out (sorry can't remember it's name), has stunning views but the owner/waitress I have to say was the rudest person we have ever met in Greece. She seemed to be more interested in the organised groups and guides than individual customers. Definately not the normal Greek hospitality. The palace got really busy just after we arrived so probably better to visit in morning/early afternoon. There's a couple of lovely little shops on the road down one selling olive wood products and another selling hand made clay pottery etc.The gentleman even gave us a demonstration making the pottery. Not sure if the palace is somewhere we would visit again as once you've seen it, don't think anything would change, but saying that wouldn't not go again."
"July 12, 2018",4.0,A place too spent some time in corfu,"We visit the palace as we were in Corfu. The palace is outside Corfu City on a hill. The palace was built by Sissi, so it's more a must see for Germans. This enables an inside in her life. It was interesting to see modern palace and have a small insight in her life.  She was inspired by the greek mythology and you could spent some time in the house and in the garden around the house."
"July 11, 2018",3.0,Pretty Gardens not a Well Planned Museum,"Yes, the idea of this place is lovely. The execution is mediocre. It is a pretty building with a few artifacts. They cram a million tours into a small space in the summer. It‚Äôs hard to hear the guides, and all in all it didn‚Äôt make sense. The gardens were pretty, although not original, and the view was great. There are a ton of stairs outside, which are hard for the handicapped. There is an elevator inside, but not much beyond the first floor is even worth seeing. The price of this was included in a day tour that we booked on a cruise ship and this was honestly our least favorite day."
"July 10, 2018",4.0,Elegant,"It was hot and it was crowded but the visit was worth it. The artwork was nice. We did not take a tour of the place but perhaps we should have to hear more about the history. Regardless, we enjoyed a slow walk through the building and garden and stopped to examined what we were interested in."
"July 9, 2018",5.0,Visit,Went for a day out here cost ‚Ç¨8 each but well worth it I would recommend you get the audio tour it explains everything in English a beautiful palace well worth a visit
"July 8, 2018",5.0,a must see in Corfu!!,we really enjoyed our visit in Sissy's palace and do not forget to visit the gardens and the Achille's sculpture..
"July 1, 2018",1.0,Nothing to see here,If you‚Äôve been to any of the great palaces or stately homes in Europe you‚Äôll find this extremely dull by comparison.
"June 29, 2018",4.0,"Very nice, great a views, very interesting","We got the bus from Corfu town, the traffic is bad, if you're on a tight schedule book a taxi home as all of the taxis on the rank are pre booked."
"June 26, 2018",3.0,Lovely place but half of it closed to the public,"Typical Greek situation... A brilliant little curiosity of a royal villa, with an intriguing history and elaborate architecture, decor & gardens, one of the cultural highlights of the islands; is nevertheless only half restored, with many & major rooms closed to the public, and next to zero info available for what is left (tragic little leaflet, with no plan of the building and 1/10 of the info one can find on Wikipedia). What a waste...."
"June 24, 2018",5.0,Worth a detour from Corfu old town,"This is a strange place with a strange history. It was built as a palace for the Empress of Austria, affectionally known as Sisi in 1870s. A beautiful young woman as judged by her marble statue at the entrance and the many portraits inside. She worshipped ancient Greek culture and mythology and her palace was dedicated to her hero Achilles. The palace and garden are full of facsimiles of famous Greek sculptures but she commissioned a wonderful work of the dying hero pulling the arrow from his heel (see picture) Sisi was assassinated by an anarchist in 1890 and in 1903 her daughter sold it to the Kaiser, William II. He moved her statue of the dying Achilles from its prominent position and replaced it by the largest statue I've ever seen, a monstrous, vainglorious, triumphant Achilles, that could be seen from afar at sea. (see picture). The disturbing feature of the palace is that it has a huge staircase in the entrance hall going up four floors with small dark rooms before you end up in the statue garden in the blazing sunshine. You then realise that the whole edifice is built on a mountain side and the garden is on an artificial plateau that had been blasted away with gunpowder."
"June 22, 2018",5.0,Well worth a visit,We visited the Palace on a Grand Island Tour organised by Vlaseros Travel from Sidari. Our guide was a local tour / historian guide and gave us lots of information before we actually went into the Palace. The normal entrance fee is 8 euros but if you go with a tour they buy the tickets for you and you pay 5 euros. it was very busy but gave you an idea of how 'the other half lived ' The gardens are excellent with a magnificent 11.5 mtr high statue of Archilles and the original statue of the dying Archilles. Towards the Exit is a small cafe with cakes and cheese toasties all at a reasonable price.
"June 20, 2018",3.0,Impressive Building which has seen better days!,"My wife and I are currently visiting Corfu (my first visit and my wife‚Äôs second) and are staying at the Delfino Blu Hotel at the small town of Agios Stefanos on the NW Coast.  Today we went on a full day Island Tour which included a visit to the Achillon Museum at the top of a hill at Gastouri which - depending on the traffic - is 15-20 minute drive from Corfu Town. It is a very popular local attraction so no surprise to swarms of people already there and - after paying our discounted Euro6 Adult concession entrance fees - we headed up the main staircase to the top floor.  We then explored many of the rooms but found many of these to contain very little of interest but in clear need of refurbishment. This also extended to the outside areas and although this diminished our interest the visit did serve to remind my wife that this was not the first time she had been to the Achilleion Museum. In fact she had been there on her first visit to Corfu in the early 70‚Äôs when the upper floors had been a Casino (Greece‚Äôs first)!  On leaving the property, we did pay a visit to the Cafe (on the ground floor of the adjacent building) where we enjoyed 2 excellent freshly squeezed orange juices at 2 Euros each.  All in all, well worth a visit but - with some much needed TLC - it could easily be an excellent one!"
"June 19, 2018",4.0,Full of Surprises,"Lots packed into this interesting palace, remember to look up at the spectacular painted ceilings. It gets very busy so try to choose early morning or later afternoon. We went with a tour, so whilst we had information aplenty, I would have liked to linger a little longer in the garden to enjoy the plants and beautiful views."
"June 18, 2018",3.0,Must See,Beautiful surroundings with a lot of history. Very popular with tourists and easy to see why. Can probably go fund whole palace in an hour. Worth while doing.
"June 18, 2018",5.0,The Palace of Emperase Sissi,"Great palace and amazing gardens. I loved the palace and the history of this place, it gave me a good vibe. I recommended."
"June 17, 2018",5.0,Achilleion Museum = WOW,Achilleion Museum kind of really surprised us . If you are on Corfu plse do not miss it . The inside and outside of the Achilleion Museum are very inpressive as the life of the princess . It may be ver busy with people but nevertheless a very good reason to check it out ! After the exit of Achilleion Museum the restaurant on the left side ahs an awesome view !
"June 16, 2018",4.0,Beautiful building and views,"I went here mostly because I heard they had a penny press machine (they don't anymore) but as a happy bonus, I love historical buildings- I'm a NT member. We had a hire car and got here around 4pm so it was lovely and quiet. The building does make you say 'wow' and the gardens and surrounding views make you want to take photos! The rooms and exhibits are a little disappointing although I'm not sure why, I think maybe the lack of them? Also, using the audio guide is simple but more time consuming than reading something, I used it for a few key bits I was interested in. There is a lovely courtyard with a bar bit but no tables or seats? Not my favoueute historical building but I would love to go to an event here like a wedding or masked ball, it would be stunning."
"June 15, 2018",4.0,Stunning views and location not long enough to warrant cost,"Myself and family really were looking forward to seeing this highlight of the island. We were on a family holiday staying in Sidari. We booked onto a coach tour which stopped at Achilleion Palace, Mouse island and Corfu town. This was the main attraction we wanted to see. On arrival we were told that we had 1 hour. There was a que to purchase our tickets 5 mins a que to get our handset 5 mins and a que to hand them back. Also a que for the toilet 5 mins. Realistically we had 40 mins to look around this stunning attraction which had cost 20 euros to get there and 8 euros each entry. Not worth the money! if you do go to this attraction try to get there under your own steam so that you can get the best experience."
"June 13, 2018",5.0,Magic palace,"Such a beautiful place. Perfect palace with spectacular view. Beautiful colors,statues and gardens. It helps you travel in another time and feel the vibes of the palace. Ticket cost 8‚Ç¨,this is the price with no guide. You can buy also with a guide and the price is 10‚Ç¨. Hope you will enjoy the walk in the palace.!"
"June 12, 2018",4.0,Great sculptures!,A nice place to visit to get to know some history. The palace (inside) it self is nothing special but the gardens and the sculptures are amazing. The big Achilles statue at the end of the garden is great.
"June 12, 2018",5.0,Stunning,"Well worth the visit great museum packed with history, artefacts, paintings and brilliant sculptures. Also has some stunning views from the palace and well maintained gardens. Parking with your car is limited so a walk will generally be required to get to Achilleion. Included in your entry fee will be an audio device (11 languages), however, you must have your passport with you and queues for the device are lengthy. A gift shop and an outside refreshment are also to be found here."
"June 12, 2018",5.0,Sisi's Palace,"This was the primary stop during our shore excursion, a wonderful building and experience through the museum and gardens. The Empress of Austria, Elisabeth of Bavaria, visited Corfu in 1888 and decided it was her favoured place to enjoy a vacation. History tells us, and a visit to Vienna will confirm, that the Empress liked beauty and she decided that her palace would be a beautiful building and gratify her admiration for Greece, its language and its culture. She had a fascination of the Greek hero, Achilles; the palace is named after him, there are paintings and statues throughout the building and his sculpture is the centrepiece in the gardens. Our guided tour was exceptional, you felt as if you were living history through gallery after gallery and the treasures displayed, the grand staircase, the gardens with their many wonderful statues and sculptures, the striking architecture of the building. The Empress was a frequent visitor until her assassination in 1899"
"June 11, 2018",5.0,Memorable visit and bus ride. Justifiably very popular.,"My wife and I visited this museum after taking an enjoyable ride on the number ten bus from Corfu town. Cost was ‚Ç¨1.70 bought in advance. It was a zone B, pink zone, ticket, one way. We bought return singles also. The bus was about 20 minutes late and took about 25 minutes to get there along some very windy roads and hairpin bends. To return to Corfu use the same bus stop. The buses go one way past here. We arrived about 1140.  Entrance cost ‚Ç¨8. There were a few tour parties but these were easily avoided.  The first room visited on the right, after the entrance hall, is the catholic chapel of the Empress Elisabeth, easily missed if you are not concentrating.  The staircase going up and down was spectacular.  The statues of dying Achilles and victorious Achilles in the garden were memorable.  Disappointing only part of the extensive gardens could be explored. The Empress had a way built from the palace to the sea which would have been impressive but, if this still exists, was impossible to visit.  There are WCs and a caf√©.  The bus ride back was also a good experience,"
"June 11, 2018",5.0,"Beautiful palace and gardens, with sea views.",Don't miss this - a five star experience. A beautiful palace once occupied by the Empress of Austria.
"June 10, 2018",5.0,Astonishing place,"Not much inside, it is rather simple and unsophisticated, I was expecting more from a building that belonged to Sissi (Habsburg) but then again this showed how humbled she was and did not fill up the building with useless art and hopeless decorations. The real beauty of this place is the setting and the landscape. The gardens are splendid and impeccably maintained. The only comment that I have: It is crowded. My advice, consequently: go early, beat the traffic and the convoy of busses that will pour hundreds of tourists into the magnificent gardens every hour."
"June 10, 2018",5.0,Art and architecture from the Hapsburg empress,"Built by the empress of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was her homage to Greek architecture and the hero Achilles. The garden has views of the Mediterranean, and large marble sculptures. The inside is a work of art, with painted walls and ceilings, amazing bronze had rails and bronze window and door treatments. There is a self-paced audio tour you can take. It can be reached by car, or by the Blue Line of the hop on hop off bus - but you will have more time if you drive there. If you do not go, you will kick yourself for not going."
"June 8, 2018",5.0,Amazing,"5 euros well spent, we came here as part of a Thomas Cook excursion. Lovely place, very tranquil. Our guide Sophia told us all about the Villa and Museum. We learnt a lot and looking around the house and gardens were lovely. Would liked to have spent more time there but maybe next time"
"June 7, 2018",5.0,A palace fit for an Empress,"This impressive house is a jewel in Corfu's crown. While the architecture and design of the building exhibit features of ancient Greek ideas , it is the location and views which are memorable. The art exhibited , both paintings and sculptures, has historical significance. However the information provided about the person of Empress Elizabeth of Austria , her life and life style, brings this place into the context of 19 centuary European history. House and garden take about 1.5 hours to visit. 8 euro enterance fee includes an excellent audio guide."
"June 6, 2018",4.0,"Interesting site, a must when visiting Corfu!","Mesmerising statues with fantastic history!  Make sure to bring a form of ID either license etc so that you can be guided via a handheld radio. The reason for the ID is that many radios were stolen in the past and it‚Äôs a form of security ensuring they get them back at the end of the tour.  The radio has many different languages and you‚Äôre able to skip to different parts of the building/site if you‚Äôre in a hurry.  Suggestion is to visit late in the day during summer so that you‚Äôre not inundated with bus loads of tourists.  If you are hiring a car, be cautious of the tight roads on the way up to the castle which to be fair are indicative of most island roads visiting small towns."
"May 31, 2018",4.0,Mrs,Well worth a visit it has some interesting exhibits and the gardens are lovely and so are the views.
"May 30, 2018",3.0,Must-see on Corfu,"Being a bit disappointed in Corfu regarding the offer of Greek history, we were glad to be able to visit the Achilleion. The palace is beautiful, garden very nice and overall worth a visit. Nice trip to the palace, kind people and a happy wife because of Sisi-feelings. Positive feelings about this visit but I'm sure Italians would have done more with this historical place regarding maintenance and decoration."
"May 27, 2018",3.0,ok but not spectacular,It was good to see some history and to see where Prince Phillip grew up. It is only the ground floor you see through. Not suitable for people with walking difficulties or pushchairs a lot of steps outside.
"May 26, 2018",4.0,Beautiful sculptures in garden,We enjoyed our two hour visit. Nice house with some lovely art and furniture. The garden is quite large with some very impressive sculptures. Achilles sculpture spectacular. Be careful and go out designated exit as the ticket taker is wicked and will make you go around.
"May 24, 2018",5.0,This is Real History,Visiting this Palace/Museum was a wonderful way to go back into history of the region and understand how much can be learned from a visit like this.
"May 24, 2018",5.0,A must see!,"This is a must see, well worth the effort. The Museum has an audio guide system, however if you go make sure you take two forms of ID, a passport and a driving licence or the staff won‚Äôt let you have a guide, we like so many others got caught out! Also worth note is the taverna on the left of the exit, the views are stunning and the coffee is pretty good as well."
"May 21, 2018",2.0,Only if you have time left,"Not worth the effort, very kitschy place. Tickets were quite expensive. Only nice thing is the garden with the views and the bronze achilles statue. Building itself is utter kitsch."
"May 21, 2018",5.0,A must see if in Corfu,Built by Elisabeth Empress of Austria this is an important historic building that has been restored with beautiful gardens and exceptional statues inspired by Greek mythology.  The huge statue of Achilles (for which the palace is named) is on the highest terrace and should not be missed. From here you get spectacular views towards Corfu town.
"May 18, 2018",5.0,A must-visit on Corfu!,"I had no idea of this palace's existence prior to arriving to the gorgeous island of Kerkyra. I found out about it through our accommodation's landlady's recommendation of which I am highly grateful to her.  Entrance ticket was affordable and for a student it was even less. There was a bunch to see and the audioguides, which where included in the ticket price, were extremely convenient. Amount of information was vast, but still easily digestable  Strong recommendation also for non-history buffs!"
"May 18, 2018",5.0,Nice place,It is very nice place with beautiful story and outstanding views. I would also recommend the coffee a bit further down (turn left from exit and walk about 20m) with very nice views and good coffee.
"May 17, 2018",5.0,Wow,We visited on a very hot day where views of the island around where unbelievable. Especially by the giant statute. Inside contains some lovely artifacts and decore. The cafe has a lovely seating area which is a must for photos.
"May 16, 2018",4.0,A must see,A place to visit during your stay in Corfu.It takes you back in the history during the governance if Queen Elizabeth where you can witness her daily life and experience.
"May 15, 2018",3.0,Lots to say here,"In 2018- 8 Euros for an adult and 6 if you are over 65. About 3k from the little town of Benitses.  You can walk there from Benitses (40 mins) or pay 10 Euros in a taxi. Big free car park for hirers.  I would say this place is well worth a visit however the draw back in my opinion is the endless arrival of tour buses with a tour guide whisking 60 plus people each time through the building and gardens. It's like a slow moving stampede.  As Annie and I were just two we were pushed and swept aside by the Germans the French and the English bus tours that arrived who had only twenty or so minutes before they had to move on, it was furious.  The experience was not a good one for us but the palace is truly beautiful and I think there needs to be limited number tours offered after hours like they do in the Basilica in Venice.One really needs time to absorb the sheer opulance of the place.  We took a few photos and Annie commented on the gigantic bronze of Achilles whom she said had buns of steel!  The immediate area is not that well serviced by real traditional Greek cafes and the Thai waitress who said all there was available was ham and cheese rolls kind of left us feeling a little robbed.  We walked back to Benitses (40 mins) and caught the 16.40 bus back to the hotel. (1.80 each, The Marbella) (20 Euros from the hotel to the Palace if you're mad enough to pay)  Beware walking on the roads. Always walk on the side the traffic is approaching you so you can see what's going on. Cars,buses and lorries move very fast and you need to be very aware at all times. Be safe and enjoy the trip!"
"May 14, 2018",5.0,Achilles spear,"This should be visited at least once. The whole place both inside and outside are terrific. The views are astounding and the statue of Achilles has to be seen to be believed. The painting at the top of the staircase was breathtaking but really, the view from the garden makes it unmissable."
"May 12, 2018",3.0,Interesting attraction.........But !!,An amazing building but unfortunately our guide completely overwhelmed us with historical detailed information which detracted from the visit. The adjacent cafe however had amazing views and was worth a visit.
"May 11, 2018",2.0,Not worth the money.,"Paid for handheld guide outside but then demanded ID inside which we did not have. No option to pay a deposit. Very let down, blight whole visit. Not a lot to see anyway."
"May 10, 2018",4.0,Bring original passport/drivers license/id if you want the audio,"Great place to visit. Impressed with the architecture of the palace, the paintings and murals as well as the beautiful gardens and statues. Very happy I paid ‚Ç¨8 entrance fee which included the audio guide. It provided me with plenty of information I otherwise would have missed out on. Bit of a saga to get the audio guide as you have to join the line which can be quite long and you do need an original piece of ID which they keep till you return the audio guide.... joining the line again to do so. You can keep them for 1 hr so they say, we walked around far longer with them, no problem. I did see an elevator inside the palace but better get proper info re wheelchair use etc from the source, it did not look particularly wheelchair or pram friendly to me. Cafe and toilets on premises. Without the audio guide entrance is $2 I think."
"May 4, 2018",1.0,Ridiculous,"The procedure for getting an audio guide is simply ridiculous. After waiting in front of the entrance and paying 8‚Ç¨, you have to wait much longer inside to get an audio guide and you will definitely need it, because there are hardly any written explanations! The staff is completely overchallenged and has to write down lots of personal data and takes your passport or drivers licence as deposit (just for an indifferent audio guide...)! Furthermore you can use the audio guide for just one hour, which is way too short, if you are interested in the exhibition. Thereafter you have to wait again to bring back the audio guide and get back your ID. A really unsatisfying experience."
"April 16, 2018",4.0,Great place to visit,We spent a great few hours here. It's an impressive house with stunning terrace and gardens. And a giant bronze statue of Achilles. What more could you want?
"April 14, 2018",3.0,Interesting but was it worth it?,"Went there by blue bus No. 10, ‚Ç¨1.7 each. Paid ‚Ç¨16 for us to look inside. Little there in the house. House decoration nice and looked very promising but failed to materialise with furniture. Gardens very nice. Had drink, then walked down hill to the sea shore/coast. Turned right to go to Benitses beach. Had meal there and caught blue bus No 6 back home. Great day but felt the cost of Achilleion a bit too expensive."
"April 8, 2018",3.0,Interesting but not worth to go there just for it,Interesting place with some historical interest and some art pieces. Not worth to go there just to visit it.
"April 1, 2018",4.0,Nice museum,"It was lovely march morning with amazing architecture, nice paintings, park and building. Unfortunately it was the first place there were lots of tourists. Worth to come, nice historical place. Great pics from that place. Plan less than one hour."
"March 29, 2018",5.0,Sissi‚Äôs Palace,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Sissi‚Äôs Palace. How much better can it get than standing in a vast hillside palace garden looking out on the beautiful Aegean Sea? We were only on the island of Corfu for a day during a Princess Cruise stop, but it is certainly a place I dream of returning for a longer stay. Having previously visited Bavaria and Austria on another trip, we were vaguely familiar with Sissi (Empress of Austria) and the story of the tragic assignation in 1898 in Switzerland. Built in 1890, the palace seems much older because of its classical Greek features. The opulent palace abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the Trojan War. The popularity of the Achilleion Palace also comes from the fact that a famous James Bond film ‚ÄúFor Your Eyes Only‚Äù was shot at the palace in 1980."
"March 27, 2018",5.0,An Inclusive Museum,"While not my first trip to the Island (or indeed to Greece), the Achilleion has nonetheless been on my short list for a number of years (and was definitely worth the wait!).  An architectural gem, set amongst the olive groves of Gastouri in the Corfu countryside, (10 kilometres south of Corfu Town). The site was the brainchild of Empress Elisabeth (also known as Sisi) lover of all things Greek, who used it for summer retreats. The grounds and the building, therefore, are dedicated to the myths and legends of Greece, none more so than the Hero Achilles and his actions during the Trojan War (so a must for any student of History).  Some of the works on display in the Museum include Franz von Matsch's The Triumph of Achilles and the giant ceiling painting created by Italian painter Vincenzo Gallopp, (both of which are worth seeing). but the highlight is outside in the grounds... Achilles as 'guardian of the palace' that stands proudly in the grounds, (Kaiser Wilhelm II's contribution to the Achilleion) and the subject of many a postcard over the years.  The site also boasts walled gardens and views over the countryside (which on a clear day you can see the flags fluttering over the old Fort in Corfu Town). However, for me as a disabled traveller the highlight, in the end, was the admission. Unlike any other museum, I have been to in Greece, the concessions (which usually apply only to students and seniors) applies to disabled persons too, for which admission is free! (if you have a valid card on your person). A wonderful inclusive step (which includes wheelchair access and audio guides), otherwise, admission is ‚Ç¨15.00 (non-concession)  If you do not have a car, the museum is fairly easy to find, the Number 10, (conveniently called Achilleion) from Corfu Town (2 mins walk from the main bus station) at a cost of just ‚Ç¨1.50 each way! The trip takes about 25 Mins, in which you take in some breath-taking views of the island. My advice, go late in the day (3 hours before closing) less crowded with day-trippers and finish by watching the sunset over the palace."
"March 3, 2018",5.0,Nice,"Its very nice place and interesting part of history. I suggest anyone should go and see it. It takes few hours, but its says a lot of Sisi‚Äôs life and style."
"February 20, 2018",5.0,Beautiful residence of Empress Elizabeth,We were 4 times on Corfu island but visited 3 times Achilleon... It is really beautiful - mostly for those who feels what Sissy meant to Hungarians... However - the museum is more than wonderfull :))
"February 16, 2018",5.0,Summer holiday day trip,We decided to do a day tour around Corfu island and this was part of it amazing architecture outside of building and even better inside this is a must to see that also filmed casino royal here the outside grounds are beautiful and scenery breathtaking also they have the statue of Achilles outside this country is steeped in history and a must when visiting to go out and about and learn some of the history would definetly recommended people to visit here
"February 5, 2018",5.0,Not just James Bond,"The Achillion Palce is fascinating. Not only was it where many parts of the Bond movie were filmed but the history is very interesting. Take time to read about the history before visiting because this will increase your enjoyment. If it‚Äôs not busy when you go, you must lie down at the entrance and take a photo of the stunning fresco. The only way to photograph it is from floor level. The huge statue of Achilleas dominates the beautiful gardens and there is also a statue of Achilleas with the arrow through his ankle. Then of course you will see the statues and pillars featured in the Bond movie For Your Eyes Only filmed in 1981. It‚Äôs a shame that people who visit Corfu don‚Äôt check out the history because it‚Äôs amazing and opens up the island in a way you wouldn‚Äôt imagine. I do think going round the Achillion with a guide is best. Go, savour and enjoy."
"February 4, 2018",4.0,Great Museum,"Decided one afternoon to walk up the huge 2 mile hill from our hotel (Aeolos Beach Resort) to visit Achilleion Palace Museum. Got to the top of the hill, paid our entrance fee and then went to hire the headphones with audio so we knew where to go and the history of the palace only to be told because we had no passports with us we couldn't hire them. We even offered to leave a deposit so they knew we would return the headphones but the woman wouldn't budge. That spoilt our visit a bit as all the information boards were in Spanish. Beautiful place and grounds, well worth a visit but please remember your I.D. if you want to hire the headphones and discover the history of the place. Found out some really interesting history on the board as we were leaving, that would have been better at the start of the tour so we could have had a bit of a clue as to what we were looking at."
"January 22, 2018",5.0,fantastic,one of the most beautifull places in corfu you can spend an hour in the museum and the gardens are magnificent
"January 18, 2018",4.0,Achilleion,Nice and interesting. We had a good guide: Gra»õian. He told us a lot of things about this place. I liked it so much.Before I didn't know much about it.
"January 7, 2018",5.0,Don't Leave Corfu without Seeing It,"I missed The Achilleion last time but saw it from the back of a scooter at night, thanks to a kind Greek airline employee who took me into town to my hotel. For those who are interested in Empress Elisabeth of Austria and her interest in the Greek classics, it is a must. The grounds are gorgeous, as is the statuary, especially the big one of the mansion's namesake. Wonderful artwork and wall paintings."
"January 7, 2018",4.0,Beautiful,"The Achillion is a stunning place, worth several hours of wandering. When we got there it was late in the afternoon, and not wanting to drive Corfu's 'fun' roads in the dark we did not get to spend as much time as we would have liked.  Many of Corfu's sights are linked to Elizabeth's family, so this is worth a visit to set the scene.  The gardens are lovely, some of the sites are stunning. Some areas are off limits such as the wooded area where Eizabeth would walk and there were objects linked to her family.  Sadly, the Achillion was turned into a casino prior to becoming a museum and this is evident in places. Still, it is enjoyable and worth a visit."
"January 3, 2018",5.0,back into time with an emperesse,if you go to corfu you have to see this palace gives a vieuw of all the wealth they( the austrians) had in that time
"December 31, 2017",5.0,Superb palace and gardens,"If you visit just one historic site on the island of Corfu, make it this one. Everything about the place is breathtaking - the palace, its history, the gardens, the statues, and the views. It's worth taking the audio guide, but you'll need your passport for it.  We were lucky when we visited as the place was almost empty. A different experience when its full of coach parties, I suspect."
"December 13, 2017",5.0,Beautiful Palace,This was the palace of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Kaiser William II of Germany. It is exquisite. Beautiful building and gardens full of bougainvillea. Inside gives you history of the place and many of the furnishings.
"November 30, 2017",4.0,Lovely place to stroll,Beautiful summer palace with lovely grounds and gardens. Not very busy and easy to navigate. Enjoyed having a coffee on the veranda.
"November 27, 2017",4.0,Visit to Achillion,Very interesting lovely place to look around. Stunning views and enjoyed learning about Corfu and history
"November 23, 2017",4.0,Very nice summer palace,Built in the late 19th century as her summer palace by Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria. It was built in the style of an ancient Phaecian palace. It was designed with the greek hero Achilles as its central theme. After Elisabeth was assinated the palace was bought by Kaiser Wilhelm II. There are greek paintings and statues through the palace. The gardens in the back overlooks the Ionian sea. There is a large statue of Achilles in the gardens. There is a huge painting on the upper floor of Achilles dragging the body of Hector after killing him. Most of the rooms on the first floor seemed a bit small to me and their decoration was a little drab. It was nice to visit but I wouldn't say its a must see.
"November 15, 2017",4.0,Achilleion link Kaiser Bridge not accessible,"I walked from the Mouse Island to the Kaiser Bridge which took about 45 mins. Unfortunately, there is no way to walk from the Bridge to Achilleion probably due to the steep terrain. It's unclear how the empress or the kaiser managed to get up the hillside. There was no indications at the Achilleion explaining what the travel route was in the old days. The reason the Achilleion looks bare is because it was turned into a real casino at some point. The James Bond movie ""For your Eyes only"" was filmed there. I took city bus #12 to return to the Corfu old town."
"November 10, 2017",4.0,"Interesting, with beautiful grounds to get lost in.","Although I managed to get lost on the way, once I arrived it was definitely worth the walk! I'd never heard of the Empress Sisi before visiting, and I found her story and the history of the palace quite interesting.  The gardens and the statues within them are beautiful, and I lost track of the number of times I walked around. After seeing so many of the dying Achilles figures in giftshops it was wonderful to finally see the real thing, and the panoramic view of Corfu from the Achilleon terrace was incredible.  The audio guides were a great addition to the visit and easy to use, although I wish there was more than one person working at the kiosk as the poor lady was very stressed out by the huge queues!  This is a great site to spend the day wondering around at and just take in the views. There are plenty of places to sit and there is a cafe nearby."
"November 7, 2017",5.0,üëëüë∏üëëüë∏üëë,This place is amazin to visit.Alone or with family it doesn't matthe.Palace is big and you feel like you are the prince or the princess.It is a place where you can learn about history in amazing way.Place around palace is big and full of plants.From the balcony you can see both mauntains an see.IN ONE WORD-IS BREATHLESSüëëüëëüëë
"November 6, 2017",5.0,Beautiful Palace fit for an Empress,"The Achilleion is a palace built in Corfu by Empress of Austria Elisabeth of Bavaria, also known as Sissi. The palace was designed with the mythical hero Achilles as its central theme. Elisabeth was a woman obsessed with beauty, and very powerful. Elisabeth learned Greek and she used to visit the place often until 1898 when sadly she was assassinated in Geneva by Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni. This palace seems to have a sad quality but is very stunning both inside and out. For many years used as a casino. It is easy to get to from Corfu town on the local bus which drops you off at the palace gates. It costs about ¬£16 and take your passport or driving license if you are over 65 years old, it is worth the money. The house and gardens are really beautiful, and do not miss the terrace which can be accessed from within the house or up steps at the side of the palace"
"November 6, 2017",5.0,Amazed,Well we visited the Achilleion Museum and what an amazing place it was when we arrived a load of coaches were already at the location from the 4 cruise ships docked in the Harbour in Corfu Town. we used the Bus service from Corfu Town the number 10 bus which cost a couple of euro's each well worth it. you had groups from China Japan Italy and many other nationalities in attendance all with interperters. My wife and I walked around and were stunned by the beauty of the place. the ceilings and artwork was beautiful to say the least and the grounds and it statues was breath taking with a huge Spartan guarding it. I was such great value for money and would recommend it to anyone who is visiting Corfu
"November 3, 2017",2.0,Lost history,"I am sad, this beautiful historical building is almost empty, no furnitures, paintings etc. Sissi was one of the famous and favorit Queen in the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy but in the Palace is not hungarian leaflet and voiceguide...this is unacceptable..."
"November 1, 2017",5.0,Beautiful,"We really loved it here. Was a wonderful experience, everything was well explained. The gardens were lovely and it was just a short walk from our hotel. A must-see place if you‚Äôre near."
"November 1, 2017",4.0,Interesting,A huge house that bears history. It was visited by many personalities and queen Sis (vavaria) lived there. The exhibits are many and interesting and the guided tour presents visitor with many information! A great view for the garden to the Corfu town!
"October 29, 2017",5.0,Nice touristic visit,Very interesting palace were Sissi used to go for vacation. Stunning views from the balcony. I really enjoyed the history and the statues. Good price. 8 euros entry
"October 26, 2017",5.0,Historical must see,The palace of achilleion with the story of prinses Sissy is a visit which you should not skip. It is recommened as it includes some historical and beautiful storyline which is part of the Island. We spent here 2 hrs. which was enough to see the highlights and catch some storylines. Plan a visit to the palace if you visit Corfu.
"October 24, 2017",5.0,Great place,Absolutely loved our visit. We paid the extra for the speakerphone. Worth every euro. Was a beautiful place. The garden and terraces are absolutely out of this world. The views were breath taking. The little restaurant next to the palace was brilliant with the balcony looking out over the sea view. If you get the chance. It‚Äôs a MUST.
"October 23, 2017",4.0,Enjoyable visit,"We had a guided tour which gave some proper life and history to the place. Great views to Corfu Town from the terrace. Lovely gardens and status of Achilles. Inside is ok but a lot of the content was stolen, burned or sold during the War so not a great deal is left. Reasonable admission charges. Overall it is definitely worth an hour or two of your time."
"October 23, 2017",5.0,Worth a visit!,Really good day out on a rainy day in Corfu. The palace is impressive and all the history behind is just fantastic. Bit pricey tho!
"October 23, 2017",5.0,Another home of Sisi,Interesting as built very quickly by Sisi of Austria and after her murder was bought by the German Kaiser .Shows how 2 families who started the first world war lived before 1914
"October 22, 2017",4.0,Nice morning out,"We visited the Achilleion with another couple and it was a nice morning out. The palace is beautiful and the grounds are amazing, with gorgeous views. An audio guide is included in the adult ticket which is a bonus, although sometimes the guide talks about things you can‚Äôt see or tells stories that don‚Äôt seem relevant (I might be being dim!). Overall, definitely worth seeing."
"October 22, 2017",3.0,Worth the visit,The garden and statues were lovely as was the story of Elizabeth. It was dissapointing that some of the statues and memorials in the grounds could not be seen due to inaccessibility
"October 20, 2017",5.0,Well worth it,We went as part of an organised tour with excellent guide. Very interesting historically and beautiful views.
"October 17, 2017",5.0,Italiana,This was a wonderful visit. There were no lines to get in. It is handicap friendly as it has an elevator if you need it. The inside offers a lot of history and the outside gardens are beautiful.
"October 15, 2017",5.0,Achilleion Palace,"DONT! go there at busy times. During the day several coach loads of coaches arrive and swamp the Palace. If you choose to go during these times it will not be a pleasant experience. Also - the coaches block the road and you will get stuck. The best and easiest way was to travel there by Motorcycle if you can. You can then park right outside the entrance. We went late afternoon about 5pm and had a great time with no queues. Worth a visit!! Full of history and well kept. (James Bond filmed here -For Your Eyes Only) Important! You will need your passport to get the audio guide - which you pay for. Without the passport - no guide. The audio guide is good and explains a lot of what you see, but be warned the battery life is not good and will probably fail before you get round to see everything. My advice is to do a little research before you go. Go - but not during the busy coach party times."
"October 15, 2017",4.0,autumn break 17,"Visited this place as part of a island trip, externally the palace is beautiful but internally it is in need of some restoration, but overall very interesting learning about elisabeth of austria"
"October 15, 2017",5.0,Excellent well worth a trip,"After seeing some of the reviews, I was a bit sceptical about visitor numbers. We went Saturday at about one pm and it was quite empty. There were a few coaches about, but not many people so we were very happy. All the floors were open and the actual decorations were lovely. The main staircase is the main decoration and I loved it. The gardens were very nice but now in the autumn not much in the way of flowers. Achilles was huge and looked over Corfu with his spear and his heel. What amazed me was how they built it at the top of a hill, it must have taken a lot of horses and carts to get the materials up there. We went by taxi because getting busses to the place is a logistics nightmare especially if you don't live in the capital, which we did not. It was well worth going, there are a few cafes at the top to choose from, so if you go I hope you enjoy your trip, we did."
"October 14, 2017",4.0,I expected a bit more - but Palace is nonetheless well worth a visit,"A guided tour arranged by travel agency took our group to a tightly scheduled stop in Achilleion Palace. There were so many other tour groups at the same time that most of the time went waiting for our turn to enter the next room.  Definitely worth visiting, garden is lovely, the statue of Dying Achilles is most impressive and captivating, Four Seasons fresco is beautiful and I also liked the area of Statues of Goddesses. Inside the marble staircase with its statues and Empress Elisabeth's Catholic Chapel are memorable.  I believed we would have a little of our own time, but that went queuing to the toilet and then our bus took us to another attraction. Better go on your own and not as a group member."
"October 11, 2017",4.0,pick your time,"As other reviews also indicate, it was overwhelmingly busy with (mostly German) tour parties when we were there late morning - so I suspect a good tactic is to go very early or very late. There is an audio guide with info on many of the exhibits but be aware, they expect to take your passport as collateral whilst you use it. And they say to return it within an hour. This is absurd if you are interested in everything; we were, but still didn't have time to listen to everything in an hour. Meanwhile the system for collecting/returning audio guide is a shambles, one very frazzled person on the desk to do both. For all that, this is the best thing to see in the environs of Corfu town, with quite a lot of interesting ephemera from the Kaiser and Empress Elizabeth. The outdoor terraces/views are splendid, too. So try to go when it isn't so manic!"
"October 10, 2017",4.0,Stunning location,Limited access to building with all items limited to ground floor. Fantastic views and lovely garden.
"October 9, 2017",5.0,"Amazing history, beautiful building",Unfortunately only had one hour during a tour of the island to visit here. A beautiful building containing many artifacts. beautiful gardens and views over Corfu. Would return again for a longer visit
"October 9, 2017",3.0,A bit of history,The gardens were very good but the inside was very busy and a bit disappointing. There was a few rooms open but quite bare and not a lot too see. Stunning location and room to wander.
"October 8, 2017",4.0,Nice palace,"The Achilleiou Museum is a very beautiful palace not far from Corf√π Town. We arrived there by coach, but buses take you there too. We visited the place in October and it was crowded with tourists, and I suppose it must be even worse during the summer. If you are not very interested in the story of Sissi, probably this is not the place for you. Still, you can have a glimpse in the history of modern Corf√π."
"October 7, 2017",3.0,Crowded and disappointing,"Whilst history and Greek gods are not necessarily my thing I had hoped for a bit more from the Achilleion. The first problem was actually gaining entrance. My wife is a wheelchair user and, like all museums in Greece, the Achilleion offers from entrance for such visitors. However, beware as the lady in the ticket office will ask for your ""disabled card"" (I assume a blue badge would do) , because sitting in a wheelchair and unable to walk didn't convince. The driver we had hired for the day eventually persuaded the ticket seller that only one of us needed to pay. Anyway, once inside getting around was a bit of challenge, although some ramps had been added, but moving to the upper floors required the use of the staff lift - our driver came to the rescue here by chatting to the cleaner..the statues and paintings are worth viewing, but there's only so much furniture one can view on a given day. Big tourist attraction and if you are on Corfu it would be odd not to pay it a visit, just be warned it can get crowded and the road to the attraction can be an adventure in its own right as can the parking arrangements."
"October 6, 2017",3.0,Disappointed,"The Palace, gardens and the statues are impressive but anyone going on there own without a tour make sure to take your passport /photo identification (not copies) with you. We went by taxi and payed at the gate to go in. Once in the palace we went to ask for our audio guide and was asked for ID. We had copies of our passports and my niece showed hers as only one identification was needed but the young lady behind the counter would not accept a copy and said only originals was acceptable. We walked around the Palace without any information which was not good without backup of information for the exhibits. All three of us left so disappointed. Maybe if they had told us we required original ID to obtain our audio handsets when paying at the gate we may have postponed it until another day bringing original ID with us. Thinking back I think it would have been in our own interest to go on a tour to the Palace."
"October 5, 2017",4.0,Beautiful Palace,This is a beautiful palace with incredible views and really interesting history. Lots of space and plenty of tables outside if you want to take a picnic. Very reasonable entrance charge too. A most enjoyable experience.
"October 4, 2017",4.0,Needs a lot of work,An excellent museum that is well organized but poorly maintained in the surrounding area. It is worth visiting it.
"October 4, 2017",5.0,Lovely views over the city!,"Nice little museum, make sure you take ID or your can't get the audio guide! We decided to walk up the hill as our apartment wasn't far... I'd probably get a quad or bike next time! Lots of coach trips go here, so if you are driving just be careful because roads up are not that wide! We then went to the little cafe next door, again nice views but service wasn't great."
"October 4, 2017",3.0,Nice Afternoon Out in the Gardens,"The gardens and statues in the back of the palace are the best part of Achilleion, especially the statues of Achilles, after whom the palace is named. Owing to the elevation of the palace, the cool mountain air is refreshing and the views through the trees down to the ocean and across to Corfu Town are picturesque. It‚Äôs nice to rest for a bit in the gardens.  Disappointing to me was that much of the interior is not open to the public and some displays seemed haphazard. Also, the displays did not have a lot of Empress Sissi‚Äôs furniture or personal effects, which is understandable given the palace‚Äôs history. Sissi did not spend an extensive amount of time at the palace, which was completed in 1891. She was assassinated in 1898 and then the palace was sold. The building went through various incarnations, until finally coming to rest with the Greek Tourism Association and being operated as a museum.  Entrance costs EUR8 and there are discounts available. Definitely go to the kiosk upon entering the grounds to get an audio headset. It requires leaving an ID, for which a driver‚Äôs license sufficed. The free audio headset provides information about the building, the art, the statues, and Sissi.  The palace is easy to get to by public bus from Corfu Town. Take the #10 Blue Bus from Corfu Town to the end of the line, which takes roughly 30 minutes. Get a return ticket for EUR3.40 from the bus ticket kiosk in San Rocco Square, Corfu Town. You can also drive, but parking a car at Achilleion is tight. The street is narrow and tour busses park along the side, making it even tighter. There is a small free lot, which holds maybe 10-12 cars.  There are bathrooms in the palace‚Äôs ground level and they are clean, with a sink and soap to wash hands. There are a couple of cafes within the museum‚Äôs grounds and a couple of vendors outside if you want to get a coffee, drinks, or simple food."
"October 3, 2017",5.0,Lovely gardens and great views,Beautiful building with great views and good history. Gardens are very pretty and the views are excellent. Quite busy when we arrived but it was a grey day so the beaches had probably emptied. Only detraction was the you needed your ID card or passport to get an audio guide and we did not have them with us.
"October 2, 2017",4.0,a must visit when you're on Corfu (and around Benitses),Definitely worth a visit. Could be better though... Definitely worth a visit. Could be better though...
"October 1, 2017",1.0,You need ID,"Bought a ticket on our first day as took a walk and came across the Palace. Purchased a ticket, went inside and could not get an audio guide because you needed your passport or driving licence. Hotel had our passport as we had only just checked in. Ticket office should advise you of this when you buy your ticket as without audio guide it was a pointless visit!!"
"October 1, 2017",3.0,Worth a look if in Corfu,Went here for few hours as part of our cruise tour. Nice enough building and a sad story about the history of the place . It was also used in a James Bond film (Live and Let Die ) and a casino for a few years . Great view from the gardens
"September 29, 2017",5.0,Melancholic grandeur,Knowing something of the life of Sisi of Austria will help when you visit this wonderful retreat. If you do you will appreciate what a liberation from the oppression of the Austro-Hungarian court in Vienna she must have found it. Fascinating.
"September 27, 2017",5.0,Worth it for the views alone,"At first glance you think paying 8 euros to go into the apparently small, albeit beautiful palace is questionable but as soon as you walk in to the grounds that doubt is gone. The interior is stunning with the paintings and the gardens are well maintained. The views over Corfu are worth the trip alone."
"September 27, 2017",4.0,A Nineteenth Century folly with a sad twist,"The Achilleion was built by Emperess Sissi of Austria-Hungary towards the end of the 19th century, and it reflects both her love for the island, and the prevalent tastes of Classic lovers of the time. As such, one may like it or not, but still it is a very special attraction. The untimely death of the Emperess few years after the building was completed adds to the charme of the place."
"September 26, 2017",5.0,"Wow, loads of history and beautiful artefacts","I've been to many country houses/historic homes/buildings over the years, but none quiet as charming as this one. The building and architecture is exquisite and beautiful as this one. Lots to see and look at, and there are *free audio guide machines (with excellently translated information). The house has some interesting curios to look at and learn about. The grounds and statues are beautifully set out as well. * to get an audio guide you have to leave a form of ID, there was a very long cue to get one, on the day I visited at the end of August, one poor woman was in her own trying to not only give out devices in a multitude of languages, but also collect the devices back in and return people's ID, a better system to work and manage this needs to be operated. The cue might be long, but if you enjoy interest or more than a little curious about the objects inside, getting one is a must."
"September 25, 2017",4.0,A beautiful house with history,This is a must see for visitors to Corfu who are not just interested in the beach as it provides details of history with fantastic views from a beautiful setting
"September 25, 2017",5.0,Worth visiting,"Real nice place to visit - history, architecture, nice views, nice park, and not too crowded, we really enjoyed it"
"September 25, 2017",5.0,Interesting & amazing views,"Interesting history and some very well preserved items including plans of the pre-building stage, it is a shame the whole palace could not be accessed not sure why. Well worth a visit though!"
"September 23, 2017",5.0,Astounding,Absolutely divine museum which is beautifully preserved the history of the palace is steeped in sadness and tragedy. A must see for any visitor to Corfu the gardens and views are breathtaking. We visited late afternoon and it was less crowded
"September 23, 2017",4.0,Historical must visit site for Corfu vacationers.,"We picked up our rental car in Benitses at 9:30AM and drove 4 km north to this palace. Tour buses lined the street along the large property but luckily a car pulled out and I was able to take its place. After paying 6 Euro(senior price) each at the ticket office, we entered the main drive noting several guide led tour groups being briefed before the entry. We hurried in before them only to encounter 3 tour groups already tying up the 3 lower museum rooms. So we ascended the beautiful stairs to the top floor and found 1 tour group just finishing up in the main salon so we could see that room along with several Russian couples performing multiple photo ops in differing positions in front of each of the large wall paintings. Outside here was the statuary veranda that led to the huge garden statue of Achilles. We alternated pathways to avoid the 3 tour groups, to enable beautiful scenery photos in the bright morning sun. After descending to the entry level museum floors, we were able to join other independent tourists, jostling to avoid the 2 new tour groups, and we were able to see these rooms. We were happy to visit and appreciate how the Empress of Austria put her stamp on Corfu in 1891, but my memory will be how this attraction manages to process all these multicultural tour groups."
"September 21, 2017",4.0,Lovely visit,Beautiful house & stunning grounds but my friends and I most upset when we went to collect our listen to gadgets that we needed a credit card or Passport to borrow these gadgets. None of us had these items we did have a bank card but this was unacceptable so We did the tour minus the commentary which was disappointing. Beautiful House tho & grounds though.
"September 21, 2017",5.0,Beautiful building!,"Very interesting architecture, nice yard and amazing views outside. Tha garden is lovely. The interior is stylish, we loved everything about the palace."
"September 21, 2017",5.0,Houses for the Rich,Beautiful House and Musem. Well worth a visit to see the paintings and the grounds. Best to go early to avoid the hordes of other people who were there which to me was the only downside.
"September 20, 2017",5.0,beautiful,"really worth visiting when in Corfu, this is a historical place and worth visiting expecially by those who are in love with history of places. very easy to get there also by bus apart from taxis that are also very easy to find on the island"
"September 20, 2017",2.0,Great views on the property,This palace was built by the Austrian Queen Sisi. We started with visiting the gardens. The views are amazing but the gardens themselves are nothing special. Everything is overgrown and in need of some trimming. There are 2 statues of Achilles. The marble one is beautiful. Also there are 9 statues of the muses along the columns of the palace. The palace needs a coat of paint and all of the statues need to be cleaned. Everything looks a bit run down. When you enter the palace it is more of the same. It does not have very much furniture and most of the rooms look worn and in need of renovation. They charge 8 euros to get in and say it is for the maintenance of the palace. I was disappointed with this site.
"September 19, 2017",4.0,A classical palace and a green seaside garden,"Achilleon is really the place to visit if you are fond of history, classical architecture, Italian sculptures and shady seaside parks. There's not much to see inside the palace (the interiors are rather scanty though the staircase and several wall paintings are great) but the portico with scultures of muses and the garden are very attractive. I visited the palace on Monday at about 10.30 a.m. and was lucky to meet only one group of tourists so I was able to enjoy the views with no crowds. It took 20 min to get to Achilleion by blue bus 10 from Corfu town (it starts from San Rocco Sq. once an hour) but the return was twice as that because the route included Perama district and there was a traffic jam near Corfu town at noon. I suspect there is a big problem to get to Achilleion by car - the driveway is very narrow with almost no passing bays. Not sure about car parking."
"September 17, 2017",1.0,Archilles heel,"I will admit that the estate is stately, the grounds are enormous and it had breath taking views. Still the gardens were a bit disappointing, some greens, some dried out weeds...And based on my experience with the Estate's employees and private contractor in charge of entity running this place, Its just not worth it. The employees and their ""private contractors"" really offended me personally and I felt ripped-off. Corfu was part of our cruise ship destination. We had seen good reviews and although it was an expensive taxi ride to it from the port (40 euros each way), we went anyway. At the ticket station we paid the entrance fee, which included audio guides available inside. When we approached the audio desk they refused to give us the audio guide because we had no picture identification or passport. We had not been informed of this requirement at the ticket window. Instead that information is displayed after you enter the estate. We offer our cruise ship identification, even offered to leave a substantial deposit to cover the cost of the audios, but they refused to accept it, and refused to refund us the portion of the audio fee. We asked to speak to a manager, they said noone was on-sight. We continued to ask and what they did was call ""security to explained to us the European laws"" up to now no other European country had given us problems. And, further our ship had our passports. We were given two alternative tour the estate without the audio or be escorted out. When we complained to the ticket booth on our way out, they said that the audio personnel were an independent contractor and the estate had nothing with them. In other words, they washed their hands off and turned their backs to us."
"September 17, 2017",4.0,Beautiful views,"Fantastic building with lots of statues and paintings interesting and informative tour, beautiful views"
"September 15, 2017",4.0,Beautiful architecture,"If you like architecture then it's worth visiting The Achilleion Museum whilst in Corfu. Built by the Austrian Empress CC it has some impressive statues, impressive friezes & attractive gardens. We visited with a guide so got a little of the history of the place & its owner, but there is enough to look at for folk to wander round themselves. It's not huge so can probably be covered in less than an hour."
"September 14, 2017",4.0,Sissy's palace,"This is a beautiful building with full of furnitures and paintings and other things from the age of Elisabeth queen. Insted of the amount of hungarian visitors the museum hasn't got hungarian audio guide and the audio guide does not worth it. The ticket is 8 euro for the adults. If you visit Corfu, this is a famous sightseeing to visit."
"September 13, 2017",5.0,"Fnatastic location, beautiful palace","We have been there with the advice of local people and it is one of the best places to see in corfu. Amazing view, beautiful garden and sculptures. Say hi to Achilles!"
"September 13, 2017",5.0,Truely beautiful place,"We had a car and drove up to the palace, parking was easy and free. I was blown away by the gorgeous setting of this palace and couldn't believe it was only 8 Euros entry fee. We used the free audio equipment which was brilliant because you could chose what you wanted to hear about and the information was brief and interesting. The palace and gardens are gorgeous with many beautiful statues, the views of the island fabulous. I was so glad we visited the palace as it was an interesting, stunning and a perfect afternoon."
"September 13, 2017",4.0,Lots of rooms to see inside,Nice to visit an old house and be able to see lots of the rooms inside. We tried to get a audio guide but the queue was massive as they only had one woman issuing them which was ridiculous so we did not bother. If you are NOT going as part of a coach party then get there late morning or early afternoon as the traffic and parking is terrible. It seems that the coaches all go in the morning. The gardens are really nice and the views are also good.
"September 12, 2017",4.0,Who would have thought this was in Corfu?,This was included in a tour of the island - Empress Elizabeth of Austria's summer palace - interesting history and it was just such a surprise to find somewhere like it. Not much of the original furniture left but the frescos and architecture was good. As it was included in our tour I don't know if it was expensive or not.
"September 11, 2017",5.0,Holiday,Spent the day here. We took the number 10 bus from Corfu Town which was cheaper than taking the Tour bus. The views from the top of the museum were spectacular and the museum itself was absolutely beautiful. We didn't take the audio tour as there was quite a queue there. We had lunch just outside the museum which was also very good.
"September 9, 2017",4.0,Beautiful setting,"Make sure if you aren't with a guide to pick up a leaflet as you walk in and have a read before you walk round the Palace? It can be very crowded, so be patient in the house. Whilst the inside is lovely and a good lesson in history (how they royals in the late 19th / early 20th C lived!), I preferred the gardens outside with their statues and the views were really superb. Downside is that there hasn't been any thoughts about car parking and it is really busy outside / lots of horns blaring / buses that can't get past the cars!"
"September 9, 2017",5.0,Holiday,Achillion museum was excellent with plenty of photo oportunities during your walk through the rooms and floors of the house and gardens highlight of which we thought the amazing statues of Achilles! 10 euroes entry fee very reasonable and hop on tour bus goes direct from town. A small cafe for water drinks and snacks and restaurant is also on site before you exit the site overall the visit was excellent tje Achilles statues are amazing! John +Pam Sharkey Liverpool
"September 8, 2017",4.0,Grand Mansion House.,For eight Euros admission price I can't really complain but the house feels a little empty as most of the rooms are unfurnished or sparsely furnished. The gardens are small but the views over Corfu Town are outstanding.
"September 6, 2017",3.0,Beautiful statues and villa,A beautiful villa in a perfect location. The art in form of statues and wallpaintings are magnificent. The rest of the interior is somewhat disappointing and the crowd is too big.
"September 6, 2017",5.0,do not miss it,"A royal villa with a stunning garden, incredible views and beautiful statues. It is a wonderful place where you can spend easily several hours. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Corfu."
"September 5, 2017",4.0,A Must Visit for every Sissi Fan,"Being a fan of history and knowing quite a lot about Sissi - thanks to my mother and grandmother who quite like her - this visit was very high on my to do list. Plus our tour guide (Marco Polo) also talked about the beauty of the building so we just had to see it for ourselves. Sadly my audio guide wasn't working and I only discovered that when I had marched up all the staircases inside the house. I didn't let this bother me though and enjoyed the museum. (Also, I got to use my brother's audio guide later on so I still had most of the explanations.) Very interesting things to learn here and my favourite fact about Sissi that I learned was that she used to send her hairdresser on land whenever arriving to the island to pretend to be her. This way she could sneak off the ship without anyone noticing and enjoy her vacation in the city. I would definitely recommend taking the audio guide (I'm not quite sure you can enter without paying for it anyways) because otherwhise you wouldn't get all the interesting backstories to the museum pieces."
"September 5, 2017",5.0,A stunning place,What a gem. The house and grounds are simply stunning. Incredible views. Lovely statues everywhere. A must see in Corfu.
"August 31, 2017",5.0,A must do!!!,"Achilleion is a wonderful place and you should definitely pay it a visit!! Though, bear in mind that there is limited parking available and long queues and so, if you are planning to visit it solo by car, you should be there before 10 am (I would suggest 9-9:30)."
"August 31, 2017",5.0,Excellent,Thoroughly enjoyed visit to Achillieon Palace. Exhibits well done. Great views from there. Situated close to the airport. One to add to the Corfu bucket list!
"August 30, 2017",5.0,Sissi's Tribute to the Great Achilles,"The setting of this lovely house is itself idyllic. There are wonderful views out to sea from its vantage point on the hill top.  This house was an escape for the beautiful, romantic, Empress Sissi and here she immersed herself in the spirit of ancient Greece and dedicated her house to her hero, Achilles, the warrior king of the Myrmidons, who killed prince Hector in the Trojan war (in revenge for Hector's slaying of Achilles' best friend, Patrocles). The scene of Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body behind his chariot is captured in a magnificent painting which hangs over the stair-well to the rear of the house. It is so lifelike that one feels actually present at the occasion.  For those who appreciate a more modern take, there is a room on the first floor which screens old films depicting Sissi's life.  The entrance fee is about ‚Ç¨8 for adults, while children go free. Included in the price is an audio guide. There are refreshments available at the usual, very reasonable, Corfiot prices and, of course, the staff and assistants are wonderfully friendly. All speak English.  This house is a ""must see"". We had two teenagers with us who thoroughly enjoyed the visit.  Sissi's tribute to the great Achilles Is a house that will surely please Built on the side of a hill With a view that will thrill She clearly thought he was the bees knees"
"August 30, 2017",4.0,Day Trip,"Only got an hour in this place, but to be fair, that was more than enough. The history in this place is fantastic, and its homage to Achilles, well you will have to judge that for yourself, but the architecture, landscaping and the especially the views, you can see why its so popular."
"August 29, 2017",5.0,Intetesting,Very nice place to visit complete with audio device explaining each corner of the palace. Narration was very easy to understand.
"August 28, 2017",5.0,Very Interesting Place,"We visited the Achilleion as part of a day excursion while on a cruise of the Adriatic. The palace is very well kept with beautiful gardens, paintings, scuptures and views from its elevated vantage point. I wish we had more time to really get to explore each room. There truly is a lot to see, especially if you are interested in Greek mythology."
"August 28, 2017",4.0,Very good,As with any review things can be very subjective. The museum and palace was fantastic. I would fully agree with those who mention how busy it can get but go early. We found even with bus loads of visitors and tours there was enough space to enjoy a few moments alone with areas of interests. ‚Ç¨15 euros for 2 adults. Both kids were free. A worthwhile visit
"August 24, 2017",4.0,Very interesting.,All very interesting learning about something passionately held by the Greek poeple. And also learning about Achilles and famous residents of the building.
"August 24, 2017",5.0,U can't miss this,"A story of romance, love of Greece by the Queen, then used in in World War by the Germans then a Casino. This is Achilleon inspired by Achilleas the Greek Troy hero. Excellent place to visit with stunning view"
"August 23, 2017",3.0,Maybe it is good for Corfu,"We arrived about 1000 am . The line for tickets was relatively short but the line for the audio guide was long. We stood about 30 minutes and finally dropped from there. We stood outside, no shade. Why it is so long? The pictures and the statuses are average. The view is nice , on top of the mountain. The parking was very busy. We were lucky to find a place just a second a bus moved . So nice place but not wow."
"August 22, 2017",5.0,What an experience,We went to the Achilles museum and we fell in love with this beautiful palace. If only these walls can talk. A must do. The most beautiful views and lush gardens. Highly recommend.
"August 18, 2017",5.0,Vacations,Exceptional museum that shows a bit of the late 19th and early 20th century European History. Well maintained and beautifully set from personnel with knowledge and good manners.
"August 18, 2017",4.0,Lovely spot with amazing views and a break from the beach!,An amazing site. Spectacular statues and other artwork with some of the best views over Corfu. The Achilles statue is iconic for Corfu (you'll see it pictured everywhere) and a picture is a must do... but the rest of the place is really smashing. Well worth the effort as an escape from the beach or the pool.
"August 16, 2017",4.0,Historical attraction,"This has a more sparse approach than British palaces, but nonetheless is a good place to visit. There is information available about the palace and Elisabeth's assassination, via documents and audio guides (you will need ID for this and the queue is quite large). The terrace is lovely and there a few statues. Well worth a visit, but not time allotted, so too many people to be able to see everything. Great gardens."
