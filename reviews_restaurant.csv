"December 5, 2019",10,Awful place!,What an overrated venue! The staff were horrible! Abrupt and unpleasant. Food was ok if you like spending over the odds for cold food that tastes like it’s straight out of the microwave! Best part was when we left the building!
"November 30, 2019",40,Take Away and Souvenirs,Place was fully packed. We end up ordering our fave take away instead. That is the classic cheeseburger. Of course we didn’t miss out on our t shirt souvenirs.
