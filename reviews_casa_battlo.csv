"November 3, 2022",1.0,A complete waste of time!,"A complete comercial experience. 15 years ago you could enjoy the house. Today there are hundreds of people crawling around, the best parts kept for gold tickets. One mainly sees two floors and the rest is a huge staircase up to the roof and down again to the basement. Two gift stores and one cafÃ© in the middle of the visit. Horrible experience. Better to look at pictures in a book!"
"November 2, 2022",5.0,Guadi's amazing Casa Batilo,It is an amazing structure from the fecund mind of Antonio Gaudi. Many creative features. It is a must see when traveling to Barcelona.
"November 2, 2022",5.0,One not to miss!! A must see for any visitors!,"Excellent visit to Gaudiâ€™s Casa Batllo - incredible building. What a talented man ! Excellent audio tour great commentary giving background to the building and individual rooms. We enjoyed a drink on the rooftop terrace to relax. Expect to be there for a good couple of hours as lots to take in. Just when we thought it was over, we were ushered into an audio visual room which was awesome ðŸ˜Ž thoroughly recommend for all ages!"
"November 1, 2022",4.0,Casa Battlo,"Loved the interactive tablet. Brought the rooms to life!!
Innovative design and engineering ahead of his time."
"October 31, 2022",5.0,Historic Building - wish I could live there,One of Gaudi's finest creations. It still looks as beautiful as when it was built. Definitely worth visiting both inside and out.
"October 31, 2022",3.0,Interesting to Walk By,It's a busy street and lots of crowds. We had seen the Casa Millo (La Pedrera) which is larger and likely his best apartment work before starting the Sagrada Familia. Worth walking passed and seeing the competitive architectural structures on the same block.
"October 31, 2022",5.0,Don't miss this!,We did the nighttime experience. An amazing way to view the structure. And the rooftop concert was super.
"October 31, 2022",3.0,"Interesting, but weird and WAY too crowded.",Way too crowded. We were barely able to move because of all the people. Very strange building. Much of the tour was off-putting due to the weird nature of what we were seeing. The owners retreat was the best part of the tour.
"October 30, 2022",4.0,Astounding architecture,"This was the last Gaudi building we visited out of our four, and was absolutely amazing architecturally. It was the only one we didn't tour, but the line was long and we happened upon it. However, just looking at the front of it made my day...such a beautiful building. Next time, I'll have to tour."
"October 30, 2022",3.0,Beautiful and amazing structure with dangerous and unhealthy crowd levels.,"The house was dangerously crowded. The lines inside moved slowly throughout the house. If there were to be an emergency, there would have been a very dangerous situation."
"October 29, 2022",2.0,$,"Don't get me wrong. Gaudi has been one of the world's greatest architects. His works, and revolutionary ideas and expressions are remarkable. I rated poor simply because of the price. Wonderful to see, but even Sagrada Familia was cheaper, and each ticket sale goes to build and participate in its construction. Yet this was more expensive. I didn't find it worth it."
"October 29, 2022",4.0,Good show great site,We want to a show here and it was avery good experience. The audio guide is great. The limitation of the number if people really helped. I would do it again.
"October 29, 2022",3.0,Interesting facade but underwhelming interior,"The facade/exterior of the building is beautiful which incidentally is completely free since you can just take pictures by the street. The tour inside feels overly commercialised and honestly there isn't that much to see. If you're in a rush and are choosing between different attractions in and near Barcelona, i'd recommend skipping this."
"October 28, 2022",5.0,Very good,A bit pricy especially golden tour but worth it. You are in another world in Gaudiâ€™s head. It is very interesting
"October 27, 2022",3.0,Stunning building with visiting flaws,"Seeing this Gaudi-designed building was a highlight of my trip to Barcelona. It was more impressive in design, to me, than La Perdrera, which is just a few blocks away. The tickets are pricey; I opted for the ""Gold"" entry, which charges more to be able to skip the entry line, and also see a couple of more rooms than on the standard tour. The self-guided tour is done on a tablet, and very well explains and shows the history, design, and family use of this beautiful building. There are virtual depictions of the original family and their furnishings. My primary criticism is that they are packing this building to the gills. Although entry tickets are timed, they are selling too many tickets for the available time slots. They've turned it into a Gaudi theme park. My time was 4:15 pm on a weekday. The crowds inside this building of small rooms, many hallways, and narrow staircases, are not just off-putting, they seem unsafe in this era. The ventilation is poor, and even on a day with moderate outdoor temperature, the interior of this building was so hot and stuffy that I wondered if I might pass out. Not kidding. I can't imagine visiting in summer. Additionally, there are many many many stairs to climb, and no seating, which in my opinion makes it difficult, if not impossible, to allow seniors, physically-challenged people, or children (of which there were many) to have a comfortable visit.
I was thrilled to visit this building, and by the end, I was desperately eager to leave it."
"October 27, 2022",2.0,Give it a miss!,We hated every minute of this visit! It was the one place in Barcelona Iâ€™d never visit again and would tell others to avoid! We couldnâ€™t actually enjoy it or take it in as we were shuffled around nose to tail of hundreds of other people! The 3D tablets add to the mayhem and people stop on stairs and in narrow doors and no one can move. A VERY unpleasant experience. See it from the outside as the building is just an empty shell anyway (apart from 2 gift shops you canâ€™t avoid!)
"October 27, 2022",4.0,Worth visiting,"A ""do not miss"" if one is interested in Gaudi. Was crowded however. We did with a private guide so definitely had lots of background and detail about the home that we probably would have missed."
"October 27, 2022",4.0,Spectacular but crowded,"The house and Gaudi's work within it, were spectacular. Despite my early start it was still too crowded. Every point of interest was jammed with folk listening to the audio and rarely holding awareness of those around trying to see. Next time I would do without audio. I ended up ignoring the stops and finding a quiet roof top space to catch up later."
"October 27, 2022",4.0,"A gem, but not easy to visit","This houseâ€™s GaudÃ­ interior is stunning. I found it more beautiful and compelling than the perhaps more famous La Perdrera. My main and strong criticism is that too many tickets are being sold for the same time slots, leading to overcrowding in narrow spaces and physical discomfort, which strongly impacts the enjoyment of the visit. At moments it seemed more like a GaudÃ­ theme park, rather than an artistic experience.
Be aware that there are many many narrow staircases to climb, and no place to sit and enjoy the house. Also, while the outdoor temperature was moderate (mid 70â€™s F), inside the house was extremely warm and stuffy, because of the crowding. Itâ€™s not a good place imo, to bring kids.
Tickets are expensive, I opted for the Gold entry, which allows much faster entry, and seeing one or two rooms not included in the standard tour. The audio guide, on a tablet with video as well, is very well done, including virtual re-creations of furnishings and family life.
I am very happy to have seen this, but it wasnâ€™t an entirely pleasant experience."
"October 26, 2022",5.0,Not to be missed,Casa BatllÃ³ is just incredible. Gaudi was ahead of his time and the architecture is stunning. We opted for the gold package. When we arrived there was a huge queue but those with gold passes had their own queue and there was about 2 ahead of us (make sure you arrive at the right time) We went through an art installation and then on to get out headsets. We had headphones and iPads. The iPads were like VR and allowed you to see what the room was like if it was empty (handy as it was so busy and full of people). The gold passes also gave you access to a room of furniture (ideas for how the apartment could have been set up) at the end we were treated to an audio/visual experience. I would recommend this tour. Well worth the money.
"October 26, 2022",4.0,Interesting venue,Be prepared for large crowds. Difficult to photograph anything due to people everywhere. Video at the end could have been the highlight but I was refused entry because I was too late. No signs to tell me that I would be denied due to late arrival ðŸ¥²
"October 25, 2022",5.0,Skip the line tickets,This is a MASTERPIECE!! The materials and textiles used to create this mansion in the early 1900's is a must see in Barcelona. Buy the skip-the-line tickets! It was a BREEZE!!
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Amazing,A wonderful story being this Gaudi masterpiece ... get tickets on line or wait a long time to get in.
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Go for the blue ticket over the silver (unless you have kids),"A wonderful experience - a must see in Barcelona. The only tips I have are to buy your ticket online when you arrive, as it is quicker and cheaper than getting in the queue, and to go for the blue ticket rather than silver, as the Gaudi Dome and virtual reality tablet are probably not worth the extra ten Euro. Having said that, the virtual tablets are great for kids - lots of interesting features to each room, including lots of creatures!"
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Better than the Basilica,"The basicila is an awe inspiring intro to Gaudi's talents, but Casa Batllo was a showcase of multiple architectural styles that were each incredible! The audio tour is the way to visit. Definitely a ""must see""!"
"October 22, 2022",5.0,Gaudi interiors!,"Beautiful interiors and a lovely house if you want to see Gaudi at his best.
Go early and pre book your tickets as it gets very busy. Be prepared there are lots of stairs too."
"October 21, 2022",4.0,Better than expected,Visiting the house is a great experience! We were a bit disappointed of the magic night show on the roof top. The flamenco show was nice but nothing special. But the house is surprising!
"October 21, 2022",4.0,Only saw outside but Beautiful,"Part of a great walk through the Eixample area. We stood across the street and loved this Building.
Part of the Block of Discord."
"October 21, 2022",5.0,A Magical House,"For anyone debating which Gaudi property to see, Casa Batllo wins over Casa Mila by a landslide. If you can at least walk by at night you will see how magnificent this building is. We had the Gold tour with the night experience. If you can, JUST DO IT!"
"October 21, 2022",5.0,Great,"Great memory. A must see!
Very organized you receive the iPad and it has all the rooms listen on it to guide your walk step by step."
