32306522,Anna September 2022 A lovely lovely villa situated in peaceful Kerkira. Ideal location if you don’t want to be around a bunch of tourist  very close to beach and amazing local mom and pop restaurants. What a charming town and beautiful and very clean villa. Alexia and Jade who are the Villa managers are so kind and helpful.  Would love to visit again and stay at MaisonRose!
32306522,Chip July 2022 Emmanuel - your Home is spectacular! Thank you for putting on Airbnb!!
32306522,Maximilian June 2022 The villa is a dream  and even more impressive in person. The on site staff is wonderful - Jade  Ricardo and Alexis were all very kind  welcoming  and always ready to assist with any questions. On the arrival day  there was some confusion with the owner regarding the usage of the chalet. It was included in the listing  but then we received a call that we should have asked to use it. That was cleared up quickly however  and we absolutely loved our experience - we’ll be back again some day and recommend you book this now.
32306522,Rhonda August 2021 Maison Rose is spectacular!The house  the location  the grounds  the view and the staff are all amazing! Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay relaxing in the beauty and the peace of the villa and spending most of our time at the house because we didn’t want to leave. Everything was thought of and the amenities are very high quality. The nearby beaches and the village are all authentic and not touristy. We really appreciated being able to stay at Maison Rose and hope to come back again! Highly recommend! Response from Emmanuel August 2021 Thank you so much Rhonda! It has been a pleasure to receive you and we really hope to do it soon again!
32306522,Pete July 2021 Beautiful property  in fact far better than the pictures suggest. Despite being modern it has real character  you get the impression it’s a labour of love . Pool area is so relaxing with excellent views. The gardens are well tended and the whole place feels extremely secure behind locked gates. Angellica’s communication is excellent and Alexia’s daily donuts and croissants a nice treat. A walk from several excellent tavernas and the beach. We’ll be back. Highly recommend!!
32306522,Amed July 2021 No ensuite toilets  otherwise beautiful!
32306522,"Anja May 2021 ""Maison Rose"" is the most beautiful house we ever stayed in. Especially the pool are with the marvelous view to the beach and the lovely living room were really great. All the furniture and every detail is extremely tasteful and Agelikki who helped us find our way around was like an angel when she appears. We could recommend this house 100 % and you will have a very peaceful and unforgettable holiday there! Response from Emmanuel May 2021 Thank you so much Anja! We will be glad to receive you any time!  Have a good trip back.  Emmanuel Show more"
32306522,Lucy November 2020 The villa is beautiful  even better than the pictures. There is a wonderful view from the pool and stylish interior with classic pieces.  It has everything you need and all the appliances are top range. There is a wine fridge to enjoy great wine  better than what you will find in the local shops  and we cooked most nights.  Emmanuel was always quick to respond and gave great tips.  Local area included plenty of beautiful beaches and coves. The nearest beach is only a short walk down the hill but I would definitely recommend a car to discover the local area.  I would 100% recommend the house to anyone looking for a stylish and relaxing getaway.
32306522,Anna August 2020 We stayed in Maison Rose for a week. Surrounded by lush Mediterranean vegetation and overlooking the sea  we spent many undisturbed hours reading in the garden or at the pool.... Its privileged location allowed us to quickly drive down to the beach for a sundowner or to the nearby charming pelekas for a backed feta with veggies (my just discovered favorite one).  We did a couple of daily trips and Angela  the lady in charge of the property  always came up with good suggestions (and fresh croissants in the morning!) and helped us with the bookings. Response from Emmanuel August 2020 Thanks a lot Anna. It has been a great pleasure to have you in MaisonRose. This encourages us in bringing each year some improvements to the villa. Kind regards   Emmanuel Show more
32306522,Spiro July 2019 Our visit to Villa Maison Rose was one of life’s spectacular experiences. Maison Rose belongs in AirBNB’s Plus category. We were very lucky to be among her 1st guests of the season and truly felt like we had walked onto a movie set. The Villa is meticulously designed  every amenity has been thought through and acquired for our comfort. Our hosts  Isabel and Emmanuel who are great communicators  have created a true relaxing hidden paradise that is moments away from the beach. Our house manager Aggeliki takes her role as house manager to a whole new level. She was knowledgeable  professional  courteous and has a true love for the villa and her island. She was very keen to make sure our stay a most memorable one and succeeded in every way possible. Our hope is to return to this magical villa and share it again and often with friends If your dates are available  book it! This is one of those villas that won't be available often due to all of the repeat guests once the secret is out. Response from Emmanuel August 2019 Thank you so much Spiro! Aggeliki appreciated you a lot and we will be happy to receive you next year. You were our first guests  and excellent ones !
30120295,Debra September 2022 We truly loved staying at this beautiful country home in the charming village of Pelekas—by far our favorite of the four we stayed at during our two week Greece holiday (and perhaps of all our Airbnb stays both domestically and internationally!). The house was immaculate  updated  tastefully appointed and comfortable. We enjoyed coffee (the best we’ve had) and delicious fruit  toast and honey gifts on the veranda overlooking the fantastic view every morning. Our generous host was very accessible—sending links to less populous beaches and favorite restaurants when asked. Despite occasional parking challenges  we would absolutely return again without hesitation!
30120295,Jonathan August 2022 This place was fantastic! Lots of space  great location in the village  very luxury minded. The hose was exceptional  and I couldn’t say enough good! Prompt and more than willing to make any accommodations needed! Thanks again!!!

30120295,Clara August 2021 The house is located just in the center of the town  walking distance from some cafes  little restaurants and a small supermarket. The house has fantastic views. It is fully equiped  we didn't miss anything. Regarding arrival and directions  it was quite easy since Giorgios assisted us with everything. He gave us a very warm welcome and he left some bread  ham  cheese  fruits and a bottle of wine  which we really appreciated. We were very confortable.
30120295,Patrick July 2021 Dear Airbnb Community   This accommodation is truely a nice place to stay when travelling to Corfu.

We can only recommand to choose this flat  all the little attention  the decoration  and the terrasse  make it a perfect stay for your holidays in Corfu. We could communicate easily with the host  and we could move our days without any trouble after missing our flight! (Thanks again for your kindness) We will never forget the amazing red sunrise above the island sitting on the terrasse. We dont think We will ever get the chance to see something similar. We felt blessed. Thanks again!

30120295,Daniel September 2020 The accommodation is amazing; clean; strong beds; beautiful view from the balcony and the place is cosy. Perfect for friends and families  it has a high-end finish and the luxury you would want especially being away from home. We were blown away with everything; from the welcome to the small things  especially in the kitchen. Everything you can ask for was there. We could not ask for a better host  communication was superb; Jorge arrived at the property at the agreed time and was there on time. The welcome we received was amazing  we were shown around the property and the photos looks just how it is in real life. We honestly want to thank you for how you treated us and the attention to detail that was put into the accommodation; we are definitely planning to return again in the near possible future!!!
30120295,Sarah October 2019 Amazing   what a find . this house has recently been renovated and every detail has been planned with luxury and homeliness in mind . Georgio met us and saw us off   he could not be more helpful - he gave us great tips on what else to do after our stay and was happy for us to call him anytime . The photos   whilst great   don’t really do the house justice - it is so well designed and decorated with the best of furniture and furnishings . On arrival we had wine   a large fruit bowl and all the water and snacks we needed for our stay . It has s beautiful outdoor area with stunning views . We brought our baby and the cot supplied was perfect   really sweetly finished with some avail baby towels - another nice touch . The restaurants are all within 5 minutes walk - when we stay again I think we will cook in more as the kitchen is so well furnished . The beach is about 25 minutes walk but there is a shuttle bus - otherwise you can drive down - lovely bars to sit whilst watching the waves   and it’s sandy unlike many other Corfu beaches .

30120295,Emilie September 2019 This was the best house we’ve had in all our years travelling. Not only was the house great  the host was great aswell. Thank you so much George! If we ever come back  you can be certain we come back here! (Also we love Corfu ;) )
30120295,Erica September 2019 This house is absolutely stunning inside and out. It is very spacious and has everything you might need. The outdoor terraces have a wonderful view and there is also a garden. George (Milena’s son) met us and was on hand for any queries we had via WhatsApp including local tips. On arrival there was water  coffee  fruit etc  general cooking supplies and  most importantly  a bottle of homemade olive oil from the family olive trees. Pelekas is a nice town with a variety of tavernas  cafes and shops (incl. a bakery). We would definitely come again. Great hosts and great house!
30120295,Arthur September 2019 Amazing house and experience. Every detail is thought upon. Terrific view from the balcony. Great location. Right in the center of the village. 5 min driving to the beach. Exceptionally clean and functional space. Very cozy and delightful.
30120295,Adrien August 2019 The house was very clean  comfortable with everything you need. We felt like home.  We enjoyed the terrace a lot  the view and the atmosphere are amazing.  A typical Greek village which is very charming.  George was more than welcoming and gave us good recommendations for our visits and restaurants.  We definitely recommand Melinda’s beautiful house.  One of the best Airbnb I’ve been to  and I’ve been to quite a lot! Go for it!
30120295,Nigel July 2019 The accomodation was perfect for us (five adults). With two fully equipped bathrooms and three bedrooms we had all the facilities and privacy we needed. The whole house is built to a high standard  so it felt luxurious. The view is amazing - superb to gaze at while eating breakfast. The host is very accomodating and welcoming. If we needed help or guidance  he was eager to provide it  with a smile.
30120295,Andrei June 2019 Amazing place that lets you experience authentic Pelekas village. Incredible view from the terrace. Very tastefully decorated apartment combining new with restored antique objects and pieces of furniture.
30120295,Karen April 2019 The place was AMAZING!! Will definitely go again  and recommend it to everyone. Hosts were wonderful.
30120295,Patricia April 2019 I recently spent almost a week at Milenas Country House  along with three others. This is located in a real Greek village close to the main beaches of the west coast and only 10kms from Corfu. Everything about the house was excellent. It is extremely comfortable and well equipped. Everything has been done with great care and attention to detail. The view over mountains and far off sea is spectacular  and the garden is full of flowers. and trees. Apart from this  one of the nicest things was the hospitality from Milena and George. George met us at the airport to make sure we found the way. Milena made us a large spinach pie. Go there and enjoy everything!

9656230,Iain October 2021 We stayed for four nights in October  right at the end of the season  two adults and two children. Vicky turned the heating on in the pool before we arrived  and we got a lot of use out of it. The villa is very clean and well appointed. Looks recently refurbished. Four pristine bathrooms and comfortable bedrooms. It’s very peaceful and not overlooked at all  feels private and relaxing. We spent one evening lying on the loungers on the roof watching the stars. Only twenty minutes from the airport. A short walk into Pelekas for the mini mart or tavernas. A short drive to three or four great beaches. The perfect place to stay. No reason not to come back. Thank you Vicky. Response from Vicky November 2021 Thank you so much Iain for your wonderful review. I'm so happy that you enjoyed your holiday and i hope to see you again. All the best!!!
9656230,Grace October 2021 Can't recommend this place highly enough! Vicky welcomed us into the beautiful villa and went out of her way to ensure our trip was perfect from beginning to end. The rooms and pool were outstanding  as were the sunset views from the rooftop. The village of Pelekas is filled with friendly tavernas where we enjoyed beautiful local food each night and also uncovered a gorgeous beach  it is also only a short drive from Corfu Town. We can't wait to come back someday!
9656230,Clare September 2021 Where to start?!!! Firstly… the villa… is beautiful… we had the most amazing time and the villa was perfect. Described and photographed accurately . There is plenty of space  all amenities and accessories that you would need. It is spotless and so well looked after and cared for! I cannot fault the villa at all!  Secondly.. Vicky… is the most wonderful and caring g host. Nothing is too much trouble. She is so thoughtful. We travelled with babies and throughout our stay she was offering and finding things to make us and the babies more comfortable. She is a fantastic host. Communication and local help and support is perfect.  Thirdly.. location.. a short and beautiful walk into Pelakas village where you will find everything you need.. plenty for restaurants  shops  a lovely bakery and mini markets… close to beautiful beaches both secluded and with bars etc..  We have just finished the most wonderful week at Vicky’s villa and we will most definitely visit again and recommend to anyone looking to visit to Corfu! Show more
9656230,India September 2021 When we found this last-minute villa on AirBnB  it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was even more perfect than it seemed online. Vicky is the most thoughtful  gracious host who made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived.  She provided us with all the information we needed including restaurant recommendations and showed us around. The villa is perfect! The kitchen has everything you would need. The bed/bathrooms are beautiful  clean and comfortable  and the outside areas are excellent. Location is great – walking distance from the beach and Pelekas Town. It could be worth hiring a car if you want to explore the island  but for us  the taxi service recommended by Vicky was perfect for exploring new beaches/areas.  Thank you Vicky for a wonderful week! We hope to come back in the future and will be sure to recommend to our friends and family. Response from Vicky September 2021 Thank you so much India. I hope to see you soon. All the best!!!
9656230,Tim August 2021 Absolutely loved our week long stay in this gorgeous villa. Short walk to Pelekas town with its restaurants and shops  and also to the two beaches with beach bars and water sports.  Cannot recommend Villa Pelekas highly enough  and Vicky is a great and considerate host
9656230,Chloe September 2019 Villa Pelekas is just lovely! And also just as stunning as it looks in the pictures. We managed to book this last minute due to other holiday accommodation letting us down and we were more than impressed. Vicky  the host  was so helpful and responsive from the minute we booked. The villa is immaculate and also in such a lovely location- Pelekas beach is only a 20 minute walk away and is a great beach which isn’t over priced or full of tourists. In Pelekas village you will find lovely tavernas with local cuisine and high quality food/ service. During our trip we were happy staying in and around Pelekas as it’s located in a beautiful part of Corfu. Although  if you are someone that enjoys exploring an island or goes out a lot  renting a car will make your life a little easier. We had no problems at Villa Pelekas and a truly enjoyable holiday - the only bad thing was that we had to leave! Thanks Vicky  we hope to see you soon:)
9656230,Greg August 2019 Wonderful villa. Great host. Memorable holiday! Response from Vicky August 2019 I'll be very pleased to see you soon.
9656230,Andrew August 2018 Viki is a great host with a super villa in a fabulous location. Despite arriving after midnight Viki was there to welcome us and ensure we knew where everything was and how it all works.  The villa is modern and lacks for nothing with thoughtful and elegant indoor and outdoor spaces and importantly for some of us in the heat of a Greek summer the Air Conditioning is excellent in all rooms. However what makes the Villa standout is the feeling of hospitality and homeliness right down to the slippers at the end of your bed  fresh eggs delivered each morning by Viki's Dad who looks after the pool and Nancy who comes in to clean twice a week.  The location is excellent for exploring North and West Corfu and we would recommend hiring a boat to view the dramatic coastline by sea  stopping at restaurants and Tavernas as you go then retiring back to the villa for the views and fabulous sunsets.  Enjoy xx Show more
9656230,Thomas August 2018 Lovely villa and perfect location! Response from Vicky August 2018 Thank you for coming at my villa. I hope you'll come again.

9656230,Michaela October 2017 Vicky is a truly wonderful host and it was a real pleasure to meet her. We will definitely be returning to Villa Pelekas. The house is so clean and comfortable and Vicky's hostessing skills are second to none. Nothing was too much trouble. Vicky went above and beyond a usual Airbnb experience. The house had beautiful views and was in a great location. Very safe for our children and the garden is well designed with an outdoor kitchen and various places to sit/lay to make the most of the sun. The most relaxing holiday we've ever had with 5 children. Thank you.
9656230,Steven September 2017 Exceeded our expectations! Villa Pelekas was perfect for our extended family  and Vicky was only too happy to accomodate any requests.

9656230,Malgorzata September 2017 Super luxury place  woderfull atmosphere  great hospitality and stunning view. Nice swimming pool- great for kids. Barbecue and lovely chillout place with a view towards the see  great for 2 families or 7-9 people. Fully equiped with anything you can think of is needed during holidays. Super clean with cleaning service every 2 days. We were served with fresh from the garden vegetables and eggs - super tasty😋. Close to amazing sandy beaches and great local food restaurants. Its exactly what we were looking for. Response from Vicky September 2017 Thank you so much for all. I hope to see you soon. Many regards!!!
9656230,Mato July 2017 Vicky was an incredibly warm and welcoming host and made sure that everything was taken care of. The villa is even more impressive in real life and feels like you are staying in someone’s residence and has a spectacular view on the sea. The location too could not be better – Glyfada beach is 5 minutes away  Corfu town 20 minutes; while the village of Pelekas is itself very pretty and worth visiting. We were exceptionally impressed with the care and attention given to the upkeep of the house  including making sure that the pool was crystal clean and the house tidy with fresh linens and towels. We were so happy to have found this place and will certainly return!
9656230,Ben June 2017 The villa was well equipped and kept very clean. It was also private but still had ocean views. Vicky was very helpful and answered all of the questions we had. Response from Vicky July 2017 Thank you for choosing my villa for your holiday. You are welcome to come again.

The host was very helpful and kind.  Access is via a narrow road  as everywhere along the coast. Be careful on the way to the beach on foot  the road is slippery.  Our stay was comfortable and nice. I would love to come back.
31658242,Lex August 2022 Very friendly people. Beautiful house with an amazing view. Would recommend this apartment to everyone that is good on their feet  because the way to the house is quite steep. We enjoyed our stay here very much!
31658242,Rosa July 2022 We had a lovely stay at lidovois place. Very clean and nice apartment. Clean sheets every 2/3 days. Location also great  but you do need to climb a bit. Would really recommend. Nice restaurants and a supermarket nearby.

Everything is in walking distance (beach  tavernas and supermarket) and you can enjoy your meal seeing and hearing beautiful Ionian Sea.

31658242,Marina July 2019 This was our second trip to Corfu and this time we were lucky to find this apartament. Stunnig view of the beach and sea will be the first thing you see when you go on the balcony. In 3 minutes you are on the Kontogialos beach. Clean and quiet studio was perfect for relaxing. By far  this was the best place we had stayed in  not just in Corfu but all over the Greece  and its not as close to be the most expensive.
31658242,Christopher October 2022 Very nice small accommodation with great sea views from the balcony. Has a small kitchen  two single beds and a bathroom  so everything you need.

31658242,Konstantin September 2022 The apartment is located in a house bias below the beautiful village of Peleka  which can boast quaint cafes  a few tavernas and a great bakery. Beach (with umbrella/sunbed rental) and supermarket are less than a five-minute walk away. The path up to the bus stop (30 minutes to Corfu town) and into the village is a bit strenuous due to the slope  but can also be reached in about 20 minutes on foot. (Otherwise  there is parking in front of the apartment for rental cars.) The room was very clean  equipped with everything you need  and the view of the sea from the small balcony speaks for itself anyway. All in all  the stay could not have been more pleasant. Translated from German  Show original
31658242,Valentina August 2022 Room with beautiful sea view  spacious and very clean  very well equipped with all the necessary utensils even in the kitchen! Beach and small market just minutes away.

We felt very comfortable there! Translated from German  Show original
31658242,Elke July 2022 The apartment building is located on the slope with beautiful views of the beach and sea. It is not far to the beach but the way back is quite steep.

31658242,Alfredo September 2021 The Lidovois are nice and friendly. The beach is a 2-minute walk (it takes 5 minutes to go back...). And the view is truly breathtaking! Car is a must  but you park in front of the house. Definitely recommend! Translated from Italian  Show original
27918942,Iryna July 2022 Beautiful house with garden see view terrase.Super host  polite and helpful.I felt me as I was at home)but next to the sea!Thanks a lot for everything)hope we will back next summer.
27918942,Dmitriy August 2021 Superb experience. The apartment and terrace are great  calm  nice view  beautiful garden. In real life  everything is the same or even better than in photos. Pelekas is an adorable small village with lots of cafes  taverns  and narrow streets(be sure to go out of the main road into small pedestrian streets). Good free parking. Theo is responsive and tolerate all my multiple questions :)

27918942,Alvar September 2022 The apartment is very well equipped and left nothing to be desired. Furthermore  it is in a great location and for longer excursions there is a scooter rental in Pelekas Town. Otherwise  everything is a 10-minute walk away for quick errands or for appetites. We look forward to seeing you soon! Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Jennifer May 2022 Fantastic accommodation  parking in front of the door  restaurants just a few meters away. It couldn't have been better. Theo is super nice and always available. We will be happy to come back!!! Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Luise October 2021 Really nice place and super relaxed  great landlords! An unforgettable view of the south-west coast of the island  a large garden resembles a green oasis. More beautiful than home :) Translated from German  Show original
27918942,Ricarda August 2021 Super dear family and a very nice complex with a great view. The apartment was very cozy and clean. We will be happy to come back :) Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Yinwei August 2022 Super accommodating host. Going above and beyond to make sure we had a smooth stay. Easily one of the best host I have come across on Airbnb!  Location of the house is superb  the house is charming with a patio that has a wonderful view of sunset.  Highly recommend 100%
13195049,Julien July 2022 Pelekas is a charming and lively little village with all amenities. The nearby beaches are very beautiful. The apartment is very well located and the terrace offers a magnificent view. A car is on the other hand essential but it is worth a little for all the island.
13195049,Philipp July 2022 Its a very nice and clean little Apartment with a wonderfull view ober the east of Corfu. I can really recomend this.
13195049,Thierry July 2022 comfortable flat  well located in the village.
13195049,Chris June 2022 Avgi and Theodore are absolute superhosts ! When we arrived  there were nice gifts waiting for us such as wine  candy  local delicacies  .... The house itself was everything we'd hoped for; clean  wonderful location  quiet and still lively (about a 1 minute walk from the town square ;-) )  and a roof terrace with a view that just has to be experienced to be believed... you can see both sides of the island  absolutely stunning and a joy to watch the sunrise while having breakfast. The location is superb  about 15 minutes from Kerkeya  10 minutes to the nearest beaches (both the popular Glyfada beach as well as the more quiet but beautiful Pelekas beach). I actually walked there as the roads are quite steep and can be challenging especially if you're afraid of heights. Our stay was generally pleasant and when there was a brief issue with the water supply  our hosts actually offered to use their showers if we wanted to.... absolutely top notch hospitality. I can easily recommend Avgi's house to anyone who wishes to experience Corfu in a relaxed and comfortable way!
13195049,Cherif May 2022 Everything in the accommodation was perfect. It had everything we need and was very clean. The view from the balcony was really nice but the location is a little bit far from the beach. The nearest beach was 30 min away by feet. Pelekas is located on a hill so be prepared to walk 200 meters down/up. We suggest to rent a car to reach locations easily. However if you are for the first time in Corfu (as we were) you may need to know that the roads are very narrow and damaged so driving will not be easy there.
13195049,Dana May 2022 We spent several days of our spring holiday in this very old  good renovate house in one of the narrow streats of Pelekas. The flat is unusual  romantic and good equipped. Breakfast on the terrace every day were unforgettable start of the day. The hosts are very attentive  they welcomed us with gifts  wine and some meals. Village Pelekas and surrounds nature are beautiful  we set out along the good mark paths (green and yellow).
13195049,Flo September 2021 The lil house is really cosy and the interior was made with an eye for a detail. The communication with the host was excellent. The location is amazing overlooking two sides of the sea. All in all would always come back there
13195049,Eva August 2021 We had an amazing time at this house! The terrace and its view is absolutely beautiful.
13195049,Guido July 2021 This place is truly a gem! Beautifully located in Pelekas  with an incredible and large terrace. The appartment is well equipped and close to the main square. The local shop owners (especially from the two bakeries next to each other) are incredibly friendly  given the waves of tourists that pass through this village. Pelekas is the perfect place to explore the nearby beaches  and it is so conveniently close to Corfu too! Last but not least  Avgi and Theodore have been great and helpful hosts  thank you!
13195049,Melanie July 2021 We stayed at avgis place for 5 days. The little town is very pretty and everyone was super friendly to us. The apartment itself is very clean and cozy  we enjoyed having breakfast on the balkony with a fantastic view everyday. The town also has a lot of restaurants which are all super delicious. We really enjoyed our stay and would absolutely come back
13195049,Florian June 2021 Really nice house located in a lovely village  with an incredible view across the island
13195049,Thomas September 2020 Had a great stay  very comfortable place  great location for exploring the island as well as for local amenities  and some of the best views of the island from the balcony. Would highly recommend
13195049,Damien September 2020 lovely apartment  with breathtaking view. we enjoyed our stay a lot. highly recommended.
13195049,Andreas August 2020 Renovated traditional village house with nice artistic touches in keeping with the old traditional character of the house. Pelekas is a lively village on a hill with everything you need (bakery  cafe-bars  restaurants  market) around the square. The house location is very convenient just next to the village square. There might be an issue for people with mobility problems because access to the house is through a few steep steps. Free parking is available within less than 3-5 minutes walk from the house. The view from the house (from both floors and veranda) is fantastic looking at the village rooftops and church  the green hills and the sea. The hosts are really friendly and helpful and communication was great.
13195049,Mark September 2019 The apartment is amazing. Theodore met us in the village and took us to the apartment. It has everything you need and the terrace is amazing. The views day and night have to be seen to be believed. The fridge already contained bottles of water  butter  pastries  yogurt  fruit juice and coffee. There was even a bottle of wine which was a nice touch. Pelekas is in a perfect location to explore the island. The taverna's in the village all serve amazing food and all within 5 minutes of the apartment. I would recommend Avgis Place to anyone preferring a village feel. That's not to say that it's a quiet place  there was always something to do in the evening from coffee bars  taverna's and bars open late into the evening. You won't regret staying in the apartment or the village. We will certainly be back. Thanks for everything Avgi and Theodore.
13195049,Merel September 2019 Beautifull house  in a really cute town in Corfu. Only nice people  beautifull beaches close to the house  good restaurants and a nice cocktail bar: Zanzibar  around the corner!
13195049,Sirma July 2019 A wonderful place in an authentic Greek village! Nice hosts!
13195049,David May 2019 We spent 9 nights at Avgi's. Everything we needed was at the house  the bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. We ate in most of the Pelekas restaurants - Jimmy's was our favourite. Pelekas beach is great but a good 40 minute walk away. Views from the balcony are spectacular. Avgi and Theodore made us very welcome.
13195049,Ervilia May 2019 Avgi is great! super quick in responding our questions and super helpful too. Check in/out went really well & easy. Apartment is nice & exactly as described. Thank you Avgi for your hospitality. We enjoyed our stay a lot and feel very welcome! Totally recommend Avgi's place.
13195049,Yoginder April 2019 This is a cosy place located in the centre of the village close to all ammenities. We enjoyed the amazing view from the balcony and the host is very friendly and helpful in every respect. We are already thinking of going back again. Thank you for a lovely experience
13195049,Luise October 2018 We had a great time in the appartment. The terrace had an amazing view and the location was perfect. We could reach the best beaches within only a few minutes by car. Avgi and Theodore were very friendly and helped us in need. We would come back any time.
13195049,Emma September 2018 My husband and I loved  loved our stay in Pelekas..a beautiful authentic little village with heaps of character..views are outstanding and the people are lovely! Food was also outstanding in the village and the house was just perfect! 5*
13195049,Jane September 2018 A beautiful traditional Greek house in the most amazing location! This is an absolute must do for anyone that wants a peaceful getaway. The house was so completely charming and so well equipped and close to local bakeries and Tavernas. An absolute delight!
13195049,Marina July 2018 Avgi's house is located in the best place to stay in village  the house is nice and comfortable  and the view from terrace is gorgeous! The village is calm  there are a lot of restaurants and shops. About 2km from the house you can find beautiful beach with warm water and sand. Really good place for vacation :)
13195049,Zuzana July 2018 Avgis house is located in the beautiful village pelekas very close to the Capital city.we were there with our two kids 4and7 and had no problem in the house. All you need od in the house.there are many restaurants around and also little shop where u can buy what u need.theodore picked us up at the airport and helped us with to hire the car.we highly reccomend to go to avgis house for holiday.
13195049,Peggy June 2018 We had a very nice stay and enjoyed the view from the terrace in the evening. We recommend the smaller beaches next to Pelekas beach. We would definitely choose again the beautiful accommodation! thank you for the hospitality!
13195049,Wouter May 2018 We stayed here for a week. It was the perfect spot to discover the island. It is located halfway the Corfu Trail and close to some beautiful sandy beaches.  Avgi and Theodore were very hospitable and always quick to respond. I definitely recommend this place!
13195049,Anna May 2018 This place is really lovely with many romantic details and good thinking behind it all. The place is georgeous and the views are beautiful. Kitchen and bathroom werde well equiped. We were picked up from and brought to the airport. There was even a cute welcome present. We enjoyed the time at Avgi‘s so much!!! There is nothing more to wish for!
13195049,Erkan May 2018 Staying with Avgi and Theodore offers the experience of what it might feel like to be a Corfiote yourself. The access to their home is easy with a car  and Pelekas is a beautiful place to explore the island from. Theodore was helpful and always available when need be. We made good friends with the bakery down the stairs of the street and with Jimmy's restaurant up the hill. The apartment was clean and tidy and we didn't mind having to go outside to take the stairs to the upper part of the apartment at all. Highly recommended!
13195049,Moritz April 2018 We had a great time in the cozy apartment in Pelekas! If you want to relax and to take a break from everyday life  this place is perfect for you!
13195049,Angela April 2018 In late march to early April  during easter 2018  we spent 10 days at Avgis place at Pelekas. When we arrived (together with our host  who fetched us at the airport) there was a storm raging on the island and a lightning struck one of the buildings in the neighbourhood  causing a power breakdown in the whole village. Our host did everything possible to restore the electricity (which was finally back the next day)  he even offered us to stay at his place in Korfu-town. This was one of many examples for the friendliness and helpfulness of our hosts. Thank you again  by the way :)  The place itself was very beautiful. The bed upstairs was comfortable and the room lovingly decorated. The view from the terrace was so beautiful  that we sat there for hours just watching over the sea  small hills  Corfu-town  the roofs of Old-Pelekas and even the Grecian mainland in the far distance. Downstairs was a small kitchen which included everything we needed for cooking and a small but beautiful bath. The living room was directly connected to the kitchen and had a couch as well as a big table for at least four people.  Pelekas itself turned out to be the best place for staying at Corfu (at least for us). In 20 minute distance to the airport and Corfu-town  it was the ideal place to start trips to every destination on the island. Beside Pelekas charming  rustical beauty it also offered restaurants  bars  cafes  bakerys and a mini-market. Most of them had opened  although it was off-season and most other places on the island were still closed. If we will come back to corfu  we definitly will take the same residence. And so should you :) Show more
13195049,Virág September 2017 This house is perfect! There is everything what you will need during your holiday. The hosts are helpful and kind  they left fig compote in the kitchen what was extremly delicious! I can recommend to everyone!
13195049,Holle September 2017 We spend 12 wonderfull days in Avgis cozy Apartment. The place was very clean and nicely decorated. Avgis Husband Theo picked us up from the Airport in the middle of the night and was very friendly. Pelekas is a beautifull little village with everything you need and great beaches very closed to it. Only points of critique could be that the mattress was kind of uncomftable to sleep on and the wasps made relaxing on terrasse nearly imbossible. But i can really recommend the place to anyone.
13195049,Ela July 2017 The flat is really nice and the views from the balcony are amazing. The flat has two floors connected by an external staircase. There is also a good sofa bed in the ground floor which was usefull for some friends that stayed only for part of our trip.The village is gorgeous and very local and can be a bit lively at night with concerts until 2am. The beach is super nice and not too crowded but still with all facilities and water sports. The hosts were great and even with a 3 hours delay flight arriving at the flat at 3am there was no issue at all. There was also some liquor  water and some fruits to welcome our arrival. They also arranged and took us to a local hairdresser as we were actually attending a wedding. It is also 15m from corfu town and other nice places. I definitely recommend this place.
13195049,Marion October 2022 Beautiful view from the terrace  lovingly decorated house  bakery and restaurants just around the corner. You can quickly reach the beach by car. We felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Anja September 2022 The two of us traveled as friends and had a great time in the beautiful apartment. The apartment is very centrally located  not far from everything important. Just a few stairs and you are in front of many delicious restaurants  a bakery and supermarket. The clean apartment is very nicely furnished with lots of accessories and a great terrace where we ended the evenings with sea views. Check-in was hassle-free  even when our flight arrived with two hours delay. The village of Pelekas is inhabited by many lovely people one is part of the community. We had rented a car...you can also walk to the beautiful Pelekas Beach in 25 minutes. Otherwise  we have quickly reached many great destinations ( Angelokastro  Porto Timmoni  Agios Stefanos  etc.). Our special recommendation is the restaurant Jimmys  the Zanzibar and the delicious bakery on the village square. Great!!!! Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Laura August 2022 Avgi's house is a very nice and sweet house. We were kindly welcomed with welcome drinks in the fridge. In the kitchen  everything you need to cook with is available. We really liked the rock face of the shower. Upstairs is a spacious bedroom with large bed and plenty of storage space in the closets. Here is also the roof terrace with beautiful views  where we ate breakfast every morning. Pelekas is a nice little village  with good restaurants and a great cocktail bar within walking distance. Nearby are many beautiful beaches that you can visit  we had rented a scooter to explore it. There is also a bus (11) from (and to) Corfu Town. This stops at the Mouxcha stop  from there it is a few more minutes walk up. The Kaisers Throne is absolutely not to be missed when visiting Pelekas  enjoy a nice sunset here from the viewpoint or over dinner at the restaurant there. Thank you very much Avgi! Translated from Dutch  Show original
13195049,Esnaut August 2022 No complaints about this rental. Avgi's companion was lovely for our welcome: accurate  punctual. The rental has a lot of charm and offers a perfect view. Use of car is required to reach the beaches (5 minute drive). Take a leap of faith at Jimmy's restaurant  not the best panorama  but the hospitality and dishes are top notch. Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Katarzyna July 2022 Thank you so much for a great stay  your Superhost title is well earned  and our time in Pelekas  Avgi  was amazing. A vibrant and functional place with a great terrace and stunning sea views on either side of the island  from Kerkyra's skyline  overlooking the mountains and beautiful mountain villages  all within the frame of the beautiful rooftops of Pelekas and its surrounding cottages in the foreground. From the deck  you can watch amazing sunrises and eat meals at a comfortable table as a part of this landscape. Shops and cafes and bars within 2 minutes ;) Great communication with owners  great check-in and checkout - great equipment. Sure  if we return to the island to Avga :) Recommended as a family of 4  the house will be good for 2 and 4 people :) Translated from Polish  Show original
13195049,Karin October 2021 A wonderful cottage in the old village center of Peroulades. Very nicely renovated  with great terrace and super comfortable bed. We stayed there for 5 days  but would have liked to have stayed there longer. The place offers many  good taverns nearby  beautiful hikes to the surrounding mountain villages  end the day in the evening on the village square in the cafe/bar. Communication with Avgi worked out very well and we say again a big thank you for the generous welcome with all kinds of treats and comfortable living in authentic surroundings. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Cécile August 2021 Very quiet cottage with stunning views of Corfu and the sea. It is possible to eat on site. There are countless typical small restaurants. A small supermarket and bakery are also at your disposal. Let's not forget the Pelekas Café located in the square where you can cool down.... Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Massimo August 2021 I can fully confirm the reviews I've read previously... clean. Complete with everything and very functional. We had a good time. Our son didn't want to leave... Translated from Italian  Show original
13195049,Margit July 2021 What a nice apartment in the old town! Very centrally located in less than a minute you can reach the nice main square with cafes   minimarket where locals and tourists meet. The apartment is well equipped. A public parking is in the immediate vicinity. Would highly recommend this place and this village. The view from the terrace is priceless. Thank you and keep it up!! Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Aileen September 2020 We can only agree with the previous reviews. The village is really cute. Nice beach  good food  nice people. The apartment is as described charming and authentically modern. It has everything you need. Clear recommendation! The only beautiful thing would have been a roof that stops the water even in rainy days  so you could still sit outside. That's the only thing. Thanks for the nice uncomplicated stay. Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Jean-Philippe July 2019 Amazing welcome since Theodor Avgi's husband  very friendly  picked us up from the boat (late arrival) and a bottle of Restina  candied kumqats  tapenade and the essentials to make coffee were waiting for us in the kitchen. The terrace is even better than the photos show: you have a view of both coasts of the island. Translated from French  Show original

13195049,Claudine July 2018 Very warm welcome from Théodore  Avgi's husband who tastefully decorated this charming village house  full of authenticity. Shaded from the sun by a plant-based arbor  the terrace offers a great 180-degree view above the rooftops: on one side the west coast that Pelekas overlooks with its beaches  on the other the east coast  the harbor and the two citadels of Kerkyra town  just 15 kilometers away. To exceed this exclusive pleasure  you have to climb to the famous Kaiser Throne  a former imperial observatory quickly reached on foot and from where you can embrace the entire green landscape of the island. This central location is perfect for exploring Corfu! Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Gerd April 2018 The apartment in Pelekas fully complies with the description and is very well equipped. The roof terrace with the beautiful view in particular delighted us. Avgi and Theodore were great hosts. Although our flight was significantly delayed and we arrived at night  we were received in a very friendly manner. Pelekas is a very nice mountain village and ideally located to discover the island with a rental car. We would book the apartment again at any time:-) Translated from German  Show original
13195049,Giorgia September 2017 The house is very nice  located in a very nice and well-stocked mountain village. From the house's terrace you can enjoy a great view of almost the entire island  which is charming. The house is equipped with everything: towels  bathroom essentials  pots and more. When we arrived  they brought us water and fruit harvested from them. The owners are very helpful  they drove us to the airport on the day of departure. Translated from Italian  Show original
13195049,Amélie August 2017 We had a great holiday in Corfu and especially in Avgi's home. This cottage is pretty and very well located in a city that we loved for its beauty and the kindness of the locals. The accommodation is also very nice  bright especially thanks to its beautiful terrace. In addition  Avgi is really friendly  accommodating and available because transfers are made from the airport to the accommodation even at late hours! We recommend this accommodation to all because it is accessible to different shops (supermarkets  restaurants  bars ...)  the beach and the bus. It will make you have a good time on the island of Corfu! Translated from French  Show original
13195049,Mirco July 2017 Clean and well-kept house  the spaces are well utilized  the hosts are available and very kind  they gave us a ride from the airport to the house and vice versa. Translated from Italian  Show original
43503163,Alexandros August 2022 We had a lovely stay at the Yuka Cottage  a very nice place at the center of Corfu run by very friendly and warm people   Kate and Toine. We had the time to relax in a quiet place  away from the crowded noisy and packed places in the high tourist season of Corfu . Private swimming pool was a pleasure for our children since they spent a lot of time there. I will surely reconsider staying there when we go back to Corfu and I will also recomend it to anyone who ll ask. Thank you Kate and Toine! See you soon!
43503163,Jens August 2022 We had a wonderful family stay at Kate’s place. The house and the interior is very nice. A great benefit are the different balconies where you can find a relaxing shadowing place. The pool is wonderful. The house is surrounded by a lot of trees and plant and you feel like to be in the nature. You can also enjoy the sunset there. Furthermore the host is ver friendly and helpful.
43503163,Georg August 2022 This place is a beautiful sanctuary. Great pool  nice outdoor showers  comfortable beds and nice interior. Kate and her husband are wonderful hosts who are very helpful and communicative. We felt very welcome!
43503163,Carolina July 2022 Very comfortable house with beautiful swimming pool! Nice beds  clean  full kitchen  new interior  enough sitting corners outside to choose sun or shade. Supermarket and delicious taverna 5 minutes drive. Owners are really friendly and helped us whenever we needed them. Perfect spot to rest and explore the rest of Corfu!
43503163,Marieve July 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at the Yucca Tree Cottage. Our hosts were wonderful  greeted us well helped us whenever we had questions or needed help. The house itself was private and very charming  surrounded by nature with beautiful views of the sunset and lots of outdoor lounging areas. Not to mention the pool which we had to ourselves  and which our kids adored. The house is well located  close to beaches and restaurants. I highly recommend it!
43503163,Manuel July 2022 We recommend this amazing accommondation. It is for all people who like the silence of nature and privacy. You only share the area with the owners. They live in another House next to the guest house. It always was a pleasure to talk to Kate or Toni. But they take care of your privacy. You have your own private pool. Which is fantastic after a beach day. We also spent some days full relexed on the pool. This place ist perfect to visit all highlights in Corfu. Of course you need a car. They kitchen is good equipped. We cooked almost every day. In the near are good restaurants too.  The communication with Kate was super easy and she had very good informations about Restaurants and the hole area. When we come back to Corfu we would love to stay here again
43503163,Bernd June 2022 We really enjoyed our two weeks at Kate’s and Toine’s place. The pool is just divine and made our stay so much more enjoyable. We loved the location: short drive to Corfu town  lots of small lovely villages around with lots of restaurant options and at the same time equal distance to explore south and north Corfu. While there is a road close by  the traffic noise disappears into the background so that it is hardly noticeable. Kate and Toine are lovely people and it was a pleasure meeting them. Would we book it again?: 100% YES.
43503163,Serena June 2022 As another reviewer commented this is bigger than it looks on it photos and perfect accommodation for exploring the area which is lovely. The swimming pool is gorgeous and Toine and Kate were extremely welcoming. Lovely stay!
43503163,Torben September 2021 A very nice and private small house  only sharing the property with the owners. The house boasts two comfortable bedrooms  a living room with a kitchen and bathroom. Outside there is a cozy shaded place and a small terrace perfect for dinning. Furthermore  there is a big pool equipped with sun beds a umbrellas. We definitely recommend this place and  if there is chance  we will return some time.
43503163,Jan Bart August 2021 This house is much better than you would get from the photos! A fantastic  recently renovated house with plenty of space: two big bedrooms  fully equipped kitchen and a good bathroom. We were here with 3 boys who enjoyed the large long pool and space. Klaasje & Antoine are very friendly and experienced hosts  who went all the way to make this a memorable experience for us. For example  picking me up from the car repair garage  everyday new recommended places and beaches. The island of Corfu has so much to offer  from beautiful beaches  nature  Corfu town and restaurants. Highly recommended- we will be back (longer).
43503163,"Rona September 2022 The accommodation is lovingly decorated and offers space for self-catering. The landlords are present and can be reached quickly in case of questions  but otherwise ""invisible "" all day. The hidden location of the house is not far from the city. The island is almost only made of serpentines  a pleasure for a good driver  less for the passenger. ;о) We had a wonderful vacation time. Translated from German  Show original"

35151250,Abigail August 2022 We truly enjoyed our stay here! Nikos was such an accommodating and the location is perfect- Pelekas is such a beautiful village with incredible views! The apartment had everything we needed and the value for money is unparalleled! We would definitely recommend  and Pelekas is great for those relying on public transport as there is a blue bus stop (to get to Corfu Town) at the bottom of the hill. Thanks Nikos for the best stay!
35151250,Jack July 2022 Had a great stay! Perfect location. Would love to go back
35151250,Jakub July 2022 Nice place in a small village of Corfu island. I would suggest setting some house rules. I.e. letting people know that every little noise is heard and they should be quite especially in the middle of the night. We were woken up by the guests above us around 3am two nights out of three.
35151250,Bella July 2022 The apartment was clean  tidy and had everything we needed for our stay. The local restaurants were great and reasonably priced. The bus to Corfu town was reliable and the town itself was lovely with lots of shops and cafes. Nikos and Dora were very helpful and replied quickly to all of our messages. During our stay Dora brought us fresh towels and bed sheets and made sure that we were enjoying our stay so far. We would definitely recommend the apartment as long as you can hire a car/scooter to reach the beach. Response from Nikos July 2022 Thank you very much for your lovely comments ! We hope to see you again next year!😍😍
35151250,Shane June 2022 Our stay in Nikos's Airbnb was perfect.  The place was very clean and had everything we needed. We especially enjoyed the lovely terrace where you can sit and chill out for the evening.  Nikos's wife Dora was very welcoming and we felt very at home in Pelekas! Response from Nikos July 2022 Thank you very much for your lovely comments !You are very welcome to come back to our apartments next year !It was a real pleasure meeting you!Stay safe !
35151250,Aada June 2022 Really nice apartment with a nice view from the garden. The host was amazing and even gave us tips about best restaurants in the area. Would recommend!
35151250,Shirley June 2022 A wonderful little room in the most beautiful and rustic village - we would come back and stay here again many times over!
35151250,Maria June 2022 localisation is perfect  close to heart of Pelecas  with wonderful garden.
35151250,Adélaide May 2022 Very charming location in a typically greek village. Be advised that the nearest beach is not really accessible by foot  but the rest of the island can easily be reached by bus from Corfou town (Saroko). Being in a tiny village house  the isolation is not that good and there can be quite a lot of humidity (also  no oven). Otherwise the view and the tiny streets are lovely and the hosts are very attentive to your every need.
35151250,Emilija April 2022 Everything was amazing
35151250,Dániel April 2022 It was a really pleasant stay at a very beautiful place would recommend to anyone.
35151250,Miroslav October 2021 Nice small apartmen
35151250,Adrien September 2021 Very nice and pretty room with a great view on the see and the hills of Corfu.
35151250,Ludmány September 2021 This place is magnificent. Nikos and Dora are very kind and the communication was smooth before and during our stay as well. Pelekas  where the accomodation is  is beautiful  quiet and very authentic. I can only recommend their cosy and classy place.
35151250,Leona September 2021 We had a really nice stay. Pelekas is a really nice stay  an original. There a some bars and cafes. You will need a scooter or a car  but in the middle of the Island its easy to get to every corner of the island. Right above the apartment  is the second Aphrodites Room. Its a bit clairaudient. The Family is so helpful. At any questions they answered really fast and even arranged a taxi to the pharmacy.  We really enjoyed staying in Aphrodites Room. Thanks a lot :D
35151250,Maria September 2021 Great location  very friendly hosts who gave us many tips on the area  very cozy flat!
35151250,Bruno August 2021 Dora is a very nice and sympathetic woman. She replied very quickly and the flat was as big as expected  even though you could hear every step or cough very loudly from upstairs. Pelekas is very beautiful and the cats that are everywhere in the streets were adorable. Very polite and friendly neighbourhood. You should come by motorbike or car  but the motorbike seemed like the best option because of the tight  curvy and steep roads. With a motorbike there is good and fast access to the beaches and a drive through Corfu is possible. To the capital/airport it’s a 20-25 Minutes drive.
35151250,Benjamin August 2021 Great place to be. In the center of Pelekas. Great to visit Corfou.
35151250,Eve August 2021 It is a cute place that has everything you need. Sometimes it can be a little loud from the people upstairs  but overall it is a very nice  clean place with very responsive and kind hosts.
35151250,Deborah July 2021 Perfect for visiting the surroundings. Many thanks for your hospitality.
35151250,Damian September 2020 Very friendly people
35151250,Karthikeyan September 2020 A nice and clean studio located near the main square of Pelekas with everything you need - the path leading to this place is adorable. The host is lovely and helpful  and the communication with them is such a pleasure <3
35151250,Maria Veronica August 2020 The house is very comfortable and pretty also if is small. The host are very kind and ready to help. There is everything you may need. You ve to do some stairs to reach it but are not so much
35151250,Magdalena July 2020 The studio is located near the main square of Pelekas  among the adorable  unique white paths. Very good comunitated with the bus to Corfu Town. There are also some shops and great tavernas nearby. The apartament was very clean and cosy  equiped with everything we needed. There was also the place outside the studio where we could sit and drink coffee in the morning (or excellent greek beer in the evening 🙂). The comunitacion with Nicos was a pleasure  he was always answering our questions quickly and was helpful in every situation. We are very happy we could spend such a nice time in Pelekas. Thank you Nicos for hosting us 🙏🏻
35151250,Remo September 2019 A very nice and kind person! Perfect host  great communication  friendly and with a lots of good tips about everything concerning Pelekas. Hope to see you again in our next holiday. +++
35151250,Michèle Maria September 2019 Nice stay for a young couple. Pelekas has all you need  good food  a bakery  small supermarket etc. Very simple  not luxurious but for the price totally appropriate. The communication was good and we even got a car arranged from the airport to pelekas and back.
35151250,Krasimir July 2019 Nice place if you need to stay in Pelekas.
35151250,Irene July 2019 Highly recommend this little gem :) great communication and hospitality.
35151250,Adam July 2019 Nice and cosy accommodation located in small streets of Pelekas village. Local people are really friendly  you can see the pure Corfu village life. The flat is approx. 150m from the center were you can find traditional tavernas  grill restaurants  bars  café's  small markets  scooter rental  etc. Nikos is kind person and greatly communicates. Highly recommended!
35151250,Simone July 2019 Arriving for the first time ever in Corfu  not having a clue on how and where to go about  our hosts were quick to answer the phone with a very welcoming tone and helped us with taxi directions etc when arriving at the airport. They were very kind and social and offered us to come and join them at one of the local bars. Had we been a couple who drank we would surely have joined them. During the trip they provided us with mosquito repellents and clean fresh towels and bed linnen. They have a back garden where you can drink your morning coffee in the cutest spot with the most amazing view over the land scape  towards the sea and the albanien mountains. Pelekas is a very charming village with a lot of olive trees. You will want to take lots of pictures of this unspoiled pearl. We had an amazing time and have been left with incredible memories longing to someday revisit Pelekas.
35151250,Claire September 2022 The apartment is conveniently located in Pelekas. Nikos and Dora are very kind and responsive hosts. Unfortunately  there are a number of negative points noted: • odor of sewage in the bathroom • mold on the shower curtain • refrigerator that no longer closes properly • very bad noise insulation  you can hear the neighbors upstairs as if they were living with us ...  With a few improvements the apartment could be really great. Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Larissa September 2022 Very cute place. Nice location! Very dear hosts!! Clean  you have everything you need! Highly recommended! The bus stop is 1 minute away and the buses run regularly to the city. (Small tip- the bus ticket can also be bought up the street in the shop (€1.50) is cheaper) Translated from German  Show original
35151250,Clara August 2022 Owners available and on time. The apartment is small and humid. The bathroom is blind without a fan and a window on the outside. The outside noises and loud noise from the tenants upstairs do not allow for a peaceful rest. Height of ceiling and bed length not suitable for tall people. Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Nikos August 2022 Dear Clara and boyfriend We have never presented our apartment as luxurious and spacious!We only say that it’s a traditional renovated apartment for two persons and the photos of it are completely real and even you can’t deny it!And of course the low price you paid for it justifies its size.Did you expect to stay at a five star hotel room at such a price?And even so why didn’t you respect it and the perfect condition it was in when you arrived?You left it in such a terrible mess with rubbish everywhere and dirty glasses pots and pans.Is this how you express your dissatisfaction?I didn’t expect that from two young and modern people.Please next time check our scores and reviews before you make any complaints about the apartment you’re going to stay!Most of our scores are 5/5 stars !And respect other people ‘s property by being neater and tidier !

Enjoy your winter in good health ! Translated  Show original
35151250,Alba July 2022 A good place to stay in Corfu. It is located in a very quiet residential neighborhood. What is the apartment itself is perfect for a stay in Corfu if you just want a place to sleep  shower and have breakfast. The photos are totally real. The only thing we didn't like is the bathroom  which needs a renovation and the garden that needed a little care of plants. Great value in Corfu Translated from Spanish  Show original
35151250,Élodie July 2022 The accommodation is located in a very nice village. Locals are friendly and welcoming. In terms of accessibility  you have the bus that connects to Corfu in 30 minutes.  Pelekas beaches are quickly accessible.  The accommodation is pleasant for a short stay. The photos in the home are a pleasure to trace the history. Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Joséphine May 2022 Warm welcome  beautiful setting  amazing locals. Big downsides  on the other hand  on the sound insulation and the bathroom which makes the bedroom very very humid. As for the room  it is correct for us who have moved a lot and who were not during the day! Translated from French  Show original
35151250,Rosa April 2022 Super nice hosts  the two. We felt welcomed and also got some tips for exploring the island. The village of Pelekas is totally beautiful and there you can have a great breakfast  coffee and eat. The accommodation was small but nice and we lacked nothing. Translated from German  Show original
35151250,Yann September 2021 Very pleasant stay in Corfu  with this small air bnb location located in the small traditional village of Pelekas. Beautiful view  very friendly locals and roof what it takes to have a good time (delicious restaurants  shops  bars and cafes etc...) Our guests were impeccable !

35151250,Χρήστος August 2021 Everything's good Translated from Greek  Show original
35151250,"Nancy July 2021 I can only recommend staying at Aphrodite's rooms and studio. The setting is beautiful  the view is crazy. The apartment is located in the heart of Pelekas  you are 2 steps from the ""center"" where you will find restaurants and bars. In this small village  everyone knows each other but welcomes their tourists with kindness and love. We loved spending evenings with the locals. So adorable and smiling. A little extra for those who love animals; there are a lot of cats on the street that leads to the center to the unit. We had so much fun cuddling and feeding them. A stay I wouldn't forget. Some tears at the time of departure as the atmosphere is special and valuable. Nikos  Dora and their sons are very responsive and just as kind as the residents of the village. They even offer to transport you from the airport to the accommodation for €30 and vice versa  which is quite convenient. The only downside I could give is the lack of soundproofing between listings but that certainly didn't stop us from enjoying the place. I highly recommend it! Thanks again for everything. Translated from French  Show original"
35151250,Thea June 2021 very nice hosts with a great place. Unfortunately  the path to the beach is very long and strenuous. As a cheap place to stay in Corfu  but definitely recommended. Translated from German  Show original
35151250,"Vincenzo August 2020 Aphrodite was impeccable. She was always present in all our requests. She helped us when we needed to print documents to be able to return to Italy due to Covid. There's no shortage of warmth and warmth.  However  I am sorry to say to those who decide to book  that the apartments  as the same owner have told us  have been renovated and refurbished but have not been soundproofed. My partner and I had a hard time sleeping because you could hear everything people did upstairs. So after a few days we asked to change apartments and Aphrodite was very kind in accommodating us by giving us a room on the first floor. But unfortunately the problem persisted as  as mentioned  the various apartments are not soundproof. The quality of sleep was not the best for us. The main rule is adaptability. The ground floor apartment  above all  is very nice but very small. There's not a table  but a bench with stools where you can eat. In the bathroom you take a shower with the boiler next to it. The bathroom with respect to the rest of the house has not been refreshed as decoration but is still functional. I have to say  for the price you paid  it's more than fine. The only negative note I repeat  is the noise between the different apartments. To get to the accommodation  if you use the navigator I recommend you put ""Pelekas Cafè"" as your destination. Then enter ""Aphrodite's Room"". You can't go wrong.  If you are planning to rent a car  know that you will have to leave it along the way and then walk to the accommodation. But it's easier with a scooter. You will be able to get to the apartment without any problems. Show more Translated from Italian  Show original"
35151250,Κυριάκος August 2019 Great all! Very welcoming hosts and the house sparkling clean!! The place is fantastic with narrow streets and very nice old houses! Great view! Translated from Greek  Show original
35151250,Alessio August 2019 Small but characteristic apartment  immersed in a typical Greek country in the hinterland but with nightlife  great restaurants and in a strategic position with respect to the island. If you need help visiting the island  I recommend it and the owner is very friendly and helpful. Translated from Italian  Show original
35151250,Isabelle July 2019 We were greeted by Dora and are sons who kindly helped us get our luggage up to the studio ! There is no access by car  and in the end it's very good because it's very quiet ! These are small pedestrian alleys  very cute  lined with jars of aromatic herbs that emanate from fantastic smells! Very functional studio with kitchen  coffee maker .... the table was set up with nice glasses and plates .... a small terrace with table and chairs with sea views! It was great ! Thank you Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Richard November 2022 gorgeous location with incredible views. modern  clean and comfortable apartment and a very welcoming host. highly recommended
32667873,Luna September 2022 Nikos' and Dora's place is situated on the hill in Pelekas with a stunning view across the island from the balcony. It is a small apartment but perfect for us as a couple. It is equiped with everything you need such as a small kitchen  dining table and balcony. The neighborhood is very nice and scenic  a beautiful small greek town and the beach is nearby. We do recommend renting a scooter or car because the walk to the beach can be a great climb.
32667873,Claudine August 2022 Beautiful spacious apartment with a panoramic view. Central location amidst the locals  I had a wonderful stay and felt at home! Will definitely be back!
32667873,Marius August 2022 The location is extremely far from any beach. The closest one is Pelekas beach  but I would not recommend it as it was dirty. Second closest is Glyfada which is great. The host was nice  but we didn't interact with her. The location is in village in Corfu  Corfu Town being almost 30 minutes away and you can't get there without a car (which is 100 euros per day) or a bike (65 euros per day). The view from the balcony is very nice and if you want a holiday far from city noise  it will suit you. At night  there are a lot of mosquitos and bees. Overall 6/10.
32667873,Maël August 2022 Fantastic sunrise every mornings  Nikos is so kind  and it’s a cute apartment in a very cute village ! I will recommend it a 100%
32667873,Tia July 2022 Great location if you want to experience an authentic Greek village. The hosts were hospitable and available if needed. The accommodation has a stunning view and ideal if wanting to stay for a few days and explore the island.
32667873,Zuzanna May 2022 The place was very clean and the owners are incredibly nice and helpful. Highly recommended :)
32667873,Kira-Lily April 2022 Our stay at Aphrodite Rooms was comfortable  enjoyable  and relaxing! The hosts were very friendly to us  meeting us at the square and giving some recommendations. They were great communicators and easy to reach via whatsapp whenever we had any questions. The balcony has a great view of the island and across the sea to Albania and mainland Greece  which we appreciated a lot. The apartment is fitted with basic requirements (towels  cooking equipment  enough shower gel for a day or two) as well as tea  coffee and some biscuits which was a nice touch. Pelekas is a lovely  friendly town and we felt warmly welcomed by the locals. The bakery in the square is a great place for some breakfast and the cocktail bar a little up the hill was a lovely night time spot. If you are renting a car and aren't used to driving in small towns then I would suggest avoiding driving through the town as it gets very tight  but there is some free parking just outside of the village and also space along the side of the roads. I would surely come back to visit Pelekas if I am in Corfu again and would recommend this apartment :) Only things to note are - the bathroom is very small and the hot water in the shower doesn't last for too long  so it's not the place to take a nice long shower  and the walls are very thin so you can really hear the neighbours. For us this was no problem  but if you are expecting total quiet then you may not get this in this type of building. Show more
32667873,Igne April 2022 Staying at Nikos apartment was very pleasant and cozy. The village of Pelekas is really authentic and beautiful.
32667873,Charlotte October 2021 We really ejoyed our stay in pelekas. The owners were really really kind. They helped us carry all of our stuff and showed us everything. They also were very helpful and gave good advise for activities/restaurants.  The apartment was totally fine  the view from the tiny balcony was amazing  we watched the sunrises each morning.  We can recommend the town's bakery a lot. We really fell in love with Corfu.  Thanks a lot for a great time in corfu
32667873,Paul September 2021 Just love for this opportunity to live in your cozy apartment! We will tell our friends about it and keep you in mind.  All the best to you  Paul and Tonia
32667873,Margot September 2021 Nikos and Dora were very nice hosts and the place is cute! The view from the balcony is stunning (lot of wasps this year so we couldn’t enjoy it as much as we would have unfortunately)  and it’s worth waking up early to watch a sunrise. The only negative thing would be the noise : the fridge war incredibly loud and we could hear everything that happens in the room downstairs (the other Afrodite’s place to rent)… Pelekas village is the most perfect location : very nice typical village  small but with everything you need and super atmosphere  and centered on the island so you can ride everywhere easily.
32667873,Jan September 2021 Awsome  we are very satisfied👍
32667873,Talea September 2021 We had a wonderful stay! It was very clean and there is anything you need. Whenever we had a wish or a question  Nikos and Dora replied within a short period of time. We had a very nice time.
32667873,Rosália July 2021 The apartment was good  bathroom was a bit tiny.
32667873,Sandra June 2021 Not great not terrible.
32667873,Natalia June 2021 Apartment was clean and accommodated in all needed amenities. The balcony has great view over the sea. The village is small but has a lot of cafes and tavernas  also easy access to nearby beaches.
32667873,Hennie May 2021 Incredible view. Dora and Nikos are so kind! Lovely place among the people the old village!
32667873,Georgia October 2020 The apartment was a fantastic stay for 3 people for a week with Pelekas town being the perfect spot for us. Great bars  friendly and fun locals and beaches really close (although quite a tough walk back up if you don’t have a car). Corfu town was also fairly easy to get to by bus and really quick by car! The hosts were extremely friendly with loads of local tips! We had such a great time  can’t wait to come back! Nasai kala!
32667873,Kaja September 2020 Our absolute favorite stay on the whole island - appartment and location 10/10  so much love for detail  a beautiful little balcony. Everything we needed and felt right at home  not as touristy as in the other appartments across the island! Would DEFINITELY recommend!!
32667873,Bernadett September 2020 Nikos and Dora were very friendly and welcoming. The place is actually even better than on the pictures. Super clean and stylish. I can highly recommend staying here if you like quiet places and breathtaking sunrises from your own little balcony.
32667873,Grant September 2020 Fantastic place and hosts. Always on hand to answer any questions we had. Thank you!
32667873,Giorgos August 2020 We thank a lot Mrs. Dora and Mr. Nikos for giving us the opportunity to stay at their lovely place. The apartment was super clean and everything was under greek regulation for Covid-19. The view was incredible and we loved to have our breakfast outside while watching the morning sunrise. If we will ever go to Corfu again  for sure we will visit Pelekas and stay at this beautiful apartment.
32667873,Conrad August 2020 Amazing location to relax  with beaches and cafes all around.
32667873,Milena July 2020 What a beautiful little apartment! When we arrived  our hosts had prepared the flat with love: everything was super clean  the table was set with plates and glass  and on our bed we found a branch of fresh mint leaves laying on the perfectly folded bed sheets. We enjoyed our stay very much  especially we loved the view from the balcony where we were watching the stars during the night and the sunrise in the morning. Absolutely recommend! Beautifully furnished apartment  great hosts  and a super cute village surrounded by stunning nature. We would love to come again! Rami and Milena
32667873,Finlay October 2019 A very elegant space with an incredible balcony view and very convenient location!

32667873,Monika July 2019 Afrodites Apartment is really cute and clean. There was everything we needed and more. perfect for cupples or travels of two/three. the location is also really nice in Pelekas. cute and calming . thank you afrodite and Nikos for hosting me and my mam ! :)
32667873,Leonie October 2022 We really enjoyed our 10 day stay in Pelekas. The place is typical traditional and a highlight was the daily visit to the bakery  which you inevitably pass by as you walk through the narrow streets to the house. The studio is small but very nicely decorated and clean. We felt very comfortable. In the morning  when the sun rises  the light falls beautifully into the room  so it's also the best time to have breakfast on the balcony. From there you can look at Corfu city and the Albanian mountains in the background. Unfortunately  there is only sun in the morning  but otherwise the balcony is golden. Pelekas is perfectly located for us as a place as we had a scooter. In 25 minutes you are in Corfu town and at the most beautiful beaches and coves of the island (northeast of Pelekas). In summary  every evening we enjoyed coming back to our little studio:) Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Genaro July 2022 Lovely place as their hosts. The place is well located to get to know the island. We loved the apartment Translated from Spanish  Show original
32667873,Theresa July 2022 The apartment is very nicely located. It is very clean  tidy and cozy. From the balcony you have a really nice view and can watch the sunrise. However  the path to the beach is a bit inconvenient without a car. Nevertheless  we enjoyed our time very much:) Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Anaïs July 2022 Great stay in this well-located studio  everything necessary for the stay is there ( missing air conditioning and dish towel to wipe the dishes). The water is not potable a small bottle of water on arrival would have been perfect but the small shop in the center is open until very late. Pelekas is a very nice little village with several restaurants and bars (we recommend the pelekas grill and at jimmy's!). The apartment is located in a very quiet location away from the surrounding noises of the center.  We had a great time! Thank you Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Tatjana May 2022 The property is located in an old house  in the old village. It's basic  but all the necessities are there. The view is sensational and the hosts are always there when you need them and support them in every respect. The communication is sensational. This love has helped me feel very comfortable. The only shortcoming is the lack of insulation in the house. I have heard the people in the apartment below me as if they were in the same room. However  I was able to coordinate well with all the other guests and we were considerate of each other. I will definitely come back. Thank you Tatjana Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Axel April 2022 Small apartment in the center of Pelekas village  itself located in the center of the island. No worries to park. The locals are very welcoming and pleasant!

32667873,Юлия September 2021 The apartments fully correspond to the photos  very small  especially the bathroom  but very cozy! Lots of small touches that say hosts try to provide guests with the utmost comfort in such a small space. The kitchen had everything you need. The views from the balcony are simply gorgeous  I met the sunrises for three days here  and everyone was unique! Among the disadvantages  I can mention the lack of mosquito nets  and thin walls  you can very much hear the neighbors  although they did not make noise especially. In general  the apartment is excellent and the hosts are friendly and helpful! Recommended! Translated from Russian  Show original

32667873,Florence September 2019 Afrodite's apartment is located right in the middle of Pelekas' little alleys  it's really beautiful. It is well renovated and equipped. Very nice view from the small balcony overlooking Corfu and the sea in the distance. We didn't get a chance to meet Afrodite  but we were very well received by his little son at the village cafe. In short  we loved it and recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
32667873,Nora September 2019 The apartment is absolutely great. The location is nice. The apartment is located in the old part of the village  which can only be reached on foot and is therefore very quiet. The view from the balcony is an absolute dream. In addition  everything is completely newly furnished and very clean and maintained. We absolutely enjoyed the days here! Translated from German  Show original
32667873,Daniele August 2019 The house is a very cozy studio  it has everything you need and is ideal for those like us who are looking for a quiet and absolute relaxation environment  the services are within walking distance and the sea is a 5-minute drive away.

30004666,Ognyan September 2022 I highly recommend this place! The house is exactly like the pictures. It's very clean  has everything you need in case you cook yourself. Great views from the terrace. The location is very convenient for exploring the island and visiting the western  sandy beaches. Vera is a great host - extremly warm and helpful. Thank you  Vera! We will be back!
30004666,Orsolya August 2022 Vera and her son were incredibly nice to us. Upon our arrival she was waiting for us with cold refreshments  home made jam and fruits. The accomodation was very clean and even nicer in reality than on the pictures. Newly renovated house with a lot of work in it  fans in every room and a very nice view from the balcony. Vera even showed us a shortcut to Pelekas. They paid a lot of attention to hygiene--change of towels on every 3rd day. The kitchen was well equipped with pots and bowls as well as the bathroom with hygienic products we couldn't bring on the airplane--which saved us a lot of money. House was about in the middle of the island which made everything accessible. If you want a caring host with a beautiful  well located house this is where you should stay. Perfect for bigger friend groups/families.
30004666,Patryk August 2022 Vera and her son are very nice hosts. House is really big and well equipment. Have all what you need during holiday. For sure one of the Best accommodation opportunities on Corfu when you travel with 6-8 people
30004666,Fernanda July 2022 Awesome and spacious place to stay  the view is beautiful. Location is perfect if you want to travel north and south  Corfu town is very close by. The host was very kind and helpful. We would love to come back!
30004666,Adrian June 2022 We had a great time at Vera's Apartment. The place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. There are no neighbors  so it is very quiet! Vera is a very kind and helpful woman. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
30004666,Sergey October 2021 An excellent  friendly  sweet hostess Vera and her son. Clean  atmospheric house near the road  but in a quiet location with great views. All the time they were wondering if everything is in order and if we need any help. Very pleasant emotions from the rest
30004666,Ana August 2021 Great house and the host was very friendly
30004666,Mihail Liviu July 2021 A perfect choice. The hosts are at their best in terms of hospitality and attention. There can be nothing better. Excellent location  away from unspoken noises for those who want peace but at the same time close to one of the most beautiful beaches  Glyfada. The villa is very nicely built  with spacious rooms furnished in an authentic Greek style  and the orchard in the middle of which it is built  brings shade and coolness. We felt really good and we will definitely be back.

30004666,Monika July 2022 It's a really fun place. It's a great place to stay  with a great view  just like the photos.

25163809,Eveline September 2022 Beautiful home and pool. Alex is a very nice and friendly host! And the recommendations from Sotiris were also very helpful!
25163809,Steffen September 2022 The house is new  lovely and clean. Floorplan is good and works perfectly together with the outdoor area. All amenities needed are present. All bedrooms have their own balcony and most bedrooms have two doors to allow for a cooling draft through mosquito nets at nights. The pool and outdoor area is carefully planned and beautifully executed with shaded area for dining/barbecue close to the kitchen  a patio area with furniture facing the setting sun and a pool area where you can find both sun and shade. At night the area is stylishly lit with indirect lights. Beds were quite hard to our liking (3 adults and 2 children) but others may prefer it.  NOISE Our main concern prior to booking was potential noise from the road. Unfortunately  this road turns out to be quite noisy. In the day when at the pool the noise from the road can be acceptable  albeit always present. At night this noise becomes more prominent and there is also noise from barking dogs  both the owner’s own two dogs just behind the house and from numerous neighbouring houses. We would have liked to have the doors in the bedroom open (with mosquito nets down) for a draft through the room at night but the noise prevented that – instead we had to close everything and use the aircondition. An additional nuisance was the mosquitos present inside the house from already when we arrived. Every night resulted in an additional 5-10 mosquito bites. An alarm in the living room also went off regularly due to low battery.  HOST Communication with the owner’s agent  Sotiris  was swift and good. Most recommendations to restaurants etc were good. When we arrived there was already ice cubes in the freezer and access to drinks if we wanted. The agent met with us in the morning before departure and was kind and helpful throughout. Show more
25163809,Deborah September 2022 Villa Alex is a beautiful house. Clean  well-appointed and spacious. The pool was maintained every couple of days by Alex. Communication was mainly with a guy called Sotiris  before and during our stay. He was always quick to respond and really helpful. We had a car so it was easy to get about and see the island. There doesn't seem to be a taxi firm local to the house  so if you need a taxi they tend to come from Corfu Town  which makes it expensive. There were a few negatives.......The house is situated on a fairly busy road and the pool is at the front of the house. With only a garden wall between the pool and the road  the noise from the passing traffic wasn't particularly relaxing. Also  the 4th bedroom is a separate studio at the back of the house. We were a party of 5  consisting of one couple and three singles  who all wanted a bedroom each  hence the reason why I booked this 4 bed villa. However  on arrival we felt like we had to negotiate the use of the 4th bedroom. It does mention somewhere that there is a separate studio available for parties bigger than 6 people  but I assumed that was additional to the 4 bedrooms. Wasn't a problem in the end but just something folk should be aware of. Also  I received a message at 9.30pm on our first night asking that we didn't have so many lights on as electricity was expensive!! Some of us were outside and some inside  so yes  there were a number of lights on but I felt that the cost of the villa rental should more than adequately cover that. Felt a little bit uncomfortable that we were being monitored so closely. On the whole though  the issues were small and our stay was a good one. Show more
25163809,Javier July 2022 We loved our stay in Corfú  Alexandros is very helpfull and everything was fantastic. We recommend him so much :)
25163809,Helen July 2022 This is a lovely villa in a great location for exploring the island . Only 20 mins from Corfu town and close to some beautiful beaches and Pelekas town. The pool is lovely and there are plenty of loungers . There is a shaded eating out area which we used every day . The house is lovely and cool even in hot temperatures .
25163809,Alasdair July 2022 lovely place. full of character
25163809,Lorna June 2022 What a villa!!! There were 7 of us and had plenty of room (and more importantly enough sun loungers round the pool). Sotiris could not have been more helpful/accommodating. Would flag you need to hire a car we didnt have one and could not get a taxi to come and collect us- luckily Sotiris got us a great deal on a hire car but most had sold out that last minute. There are a couple of tavernas in walking distance and a beach but with a v steep road down (not for the unfit) a car is a must have. Had a fantastic holiday and villa is perfectly situated to access the main hotspots.
25163809,Vivek August 2021 We just spent a week at Villa Alex and we really enjoyed it. The communication from Sotiris was exceptional. He gave us a list of recommendations and they were superb! Thank you Sotiris!  The pool area is brilliant. Our kids spent hours together in the pool and it was very difficult to drag them out. The villa is spacious and well equipped. It is located close to one of the best beaches in Corfu!!  We had a relaxing stay. On day 4  our kids didn't feel like going to yet another beach and we spent the majority of the day at the villa with great ease.  The villa is situated off the main road and very easy to find. The road noise didn’t bother us at all. There is a local taverna (1 km away) called Staurodromi and the food out there is excellent.  We would love to return to Villa Alex if we come back to Corfu. Show more
25163809,Ming August 2021 We had a great family stay. Villa Alex is a well appointed  spacious house with a lovely pool and plenty of outdoor space. 5 minutes drive from the beautiful eagle nest village of Pelekas  the house also has easy access to many beaches on the West Coast of Corfu and is about 20 minutes’ drive to Corfu Town where you will find buzzing nightlife  a great selection of restaurants  shops  markets and museums.  You can hear passing traffic during the day but at night the road is generally quiet. The air conditioning throughout the house was a must and worked very well. The kitchen equipment was adequate but could be more complete. We liked the separate self contained studio on the lower floor with a view on Pelekas. The team was helpful all along and easy to contact. A good choice if you rent a car and like discovering different locations.
25163809,Matheo July 2021 Very pleasant stay in a particularly relaxing and magnificent house. Alex and Sotiris are incredibly kind and available. The house is located in a very appreciable place  close to everything. For a discovery of the region and the peculiarities of this  I graciously recommend this rental.
25163809,Iliya June 2021 Great house with brand new pool in the country side. Communication with Alex and Sotiris was excellent and check in was a breeze. House is big  comfortable and clean. Since we had the house for 9 days  there was additional cleaning and change of linen/towels in the middle of our stay. There are no neighbours around  so no worries about noise in the evenings. Car is a must as the closest supermarket is a few kilometers away and closest restaurant is 1800m away. We followed the tips from Sotiris about which beaches and places to visit and they were all excellent! Cannot be happier. The only downside was that dishwashing machine was broken  and in spite of the assurances that it will be fixed in a few days  it was not.
25163809,Roxana June 2021 We had an amazing stay at Villa Alex! We were a group of friends spending our first holiday since the pandemic and it was absolutely perfect and everything we hoped for!  The house is beautiful and clean and exactly as the pictures and description show. It really felt like a home away from home and some days we didn’t event leave the house because everything was so perfect. Comfy beds  Spacious chill areas (inside and outside)  large and well equipped kitchen and bbq to prep your own meals and of course the incredible new  clean and refreshing pool to enjoy...  Alex and Sotiris were excellent hosts! From the moment we booked the house  communication was very pleasant and they were always quick to respond to any of our questions. We were Personally welcomed upon arrival with a bottle of wine and bottled water.. during our stay we received many many great tips on where to go  where to eat  boat rentals  etc. After asking where to get the best coffee  Sotiris even brought us the best “frappe cappuccino” of the island  to the house! They also made sure the house was kept clean and well maintained throughout our stay  regularly checking the pool and halfway through our stay the house was fully cleaned and we were provided with new towels and sheets without even asking for it... As said  excellent hosts!  The location Itself is absolutely ideal to explore all parts of this gorgeous island (car recommended).. Kerkyra town and the airport 15 minutes away  beautiful and unspoiled beaches very close to the house  central to explore both the northern and southern parts of the island...  In short: our stay Villa Alex made our vacation on the island perfect! Show more
25163809,David August 2020 Comfortable house. Pool is absolutely lovely and the location  while on a main road  is convenient for getting around the island.
25163809,Dora July 2018 A beautiful and very comfortable house  as shown in the pictures  ideal for a relaxing family holiday  and ideally located for trips to other parts of Corfu . The house is 10 to 15 mins drive from beautiful beaches and 20 mins from the town. Pelekas village nearby has nice restaurants and shops. Alexis is a wonderful host  very helpful  always available to answer questions and provide tips while very discreet at the same time. We had a wonderful time!
25163809,Serge July 2018 Alex is a great host. Very hospitable and sympathetic. The villa is as excellent as shown in the photo. I recommend for those who have a car available. The nearest beaches are perhaps the best in Corfu. I highly recommend Yaliskari beach. Next to the beautiful little village of Pelekas. Close to the Kerkira
25163809,Michael July 2018 The house was really nice and clean. With a car you reach nice beaches and restaurants in 10-15 min. Alex was a great host. Anything that was needed extra was taken care of immediately. We would come back anytime!
25163809,Mary August 2022 The house is nice and matches the photos. Some additional details: - A rather busy road passes along the pool which makes it quite noisy during the day. - access to the studio is not outside. No communication between the main house and the studio. We didn't mind but better to know because depending on the configuration of the families it can be inconvenient. - shallow pool on half the surface. Perfect for small children  less for adults who want to swim. In addition  there are water pressure problems  probably due to the overcrowding of the island in the summer. The result: no water or very little in the upstairs bathrooms around 7 p.m.  and the dishwasher washes very badly because of this problem. Covered outdoor dining area  very nice. Very hard plastic pool chairs  a small mattress on it would make them more pleasant. The kitchen also deserves a few more utensils for those who like to cook. Perfect and very effective communication with Sotiris. Overall we had a nice stay but it seems to us that the price is a little high considering the negative points indicated.

578744585432531974,Hege July 2022 We loved our stay at the apartment in the middle of Pelekas square and would love to come back. The apartment and the building it is located in were great  the view (in all three! sky directions) amazing  the location super and the mountain village of Peleka very charming.  In the apartment  you have pretty much everything you need. We were 5 people and could have wanted a few more glasses and coffee mugs and a bread knife. And we could have wanted an extra bedding. Our youngest of 10 years slept with us. The two bedrooms have two big  comfortable beds. But when 3 people are going to share a double duvet  it does get a bit of “overlaid.”  The apartment is very well suited for 4 people  possibly more if the children are young. But if you have small children  there is something else that might be an issue. (Only in July?) In the same square is a popular bar on a great roof terrace. It has a DJ playing loud music between 8pm-4am. Fun if you join the party  but if you're going to sleep  you'll need ear plugs. One night there was even a concert down at the square and we heard the music even better. We went out to the balcony outside the one bedroom  and had the best “space in the house” there.  The best part about the apartment's location was going out to the town square early in the morning and sitting under an umbrella in front of the church drinking an espresso from the bakery.

50920565,John September 2022 Absolutely lovely villa. We didn’t expect it to be as good as the pictures…but it was. Beautiful views of the ocean and we spent each night enjoying the pool and looking at the Ionian Sea. Johnny was great and gave us all the local details we needed. We would love to stay here again.
50920565,Darien September 2022 Incredible villa with unbeatable views  our stay at Ethra was perfect. From the infinity pool to the little tavern and beach down the road  it was the ideal place to experience Corfu. Johnny was an amazing host  going above and beyond to make sure it was a great family vacation. Honestly can’t recommend enough.

50920565,Jessica June 2022 We were in absolute heaven during our stay at this property. The house is perfectly provisioned for a perfect stay  from outdoor seating and dining areas  infinity pool  endless views and an array of amenities  we couldn't ask for more. The privacy of this place was amazing and quite near to a few local beaches and taverns. Johnny was so prompt with any questions and really looked after us. Thanks for everything  absolutely would stay here again.
50920565,Peter May 2022 Jonny is an absolute fabulous host & literally nothing was too much trouble for him. He was there to meet us on arrival at gone midnight and had even done a food shop for us for some essentials. The Villa is exactly is portrayed in the pictures.  The biggest disappointment however & the reason for giving a poor rating for “value for money” is that the Pool was not heating. Admittedly  this was an oversight on our part as the Villa description did not say that the pool was heated  but had we been aware of this we certainly wouldn’t have booked Villa Ethra as whilst the pool does look absolutely stunning  it was just extremely cold  quite apart from the fact that the Villa is high up & can be quite breezy. Johnny did point out that in the height of summer it wouldn’t matter  but we had good weather for the time of year with temperatures around 20° and still only used it briefly once or twice. Furthermore the sun doesn’t actually get on the pool area until around 11am anyway. For us the whole idea of having a private pool is to use it in the morning & after dark and this just wasn’t possible.  One final point worth mentioning is that whilst the Villa is on the whole quiet & very private   there were a number of days when para-gliders flew low & directly over the property; which was quite intrusive Show more
50920565,Rupert October 2021 A fabulous  modern villa with a wonderful view. I highly recommend it. The host  Johnny  was also a delight.
50920565,Vincenzo October 2021 Johnny was a terrific host! He welcomed us to his stunning villa and was helpful whenever we had any questions! the villa is stunning and only a short drive from the beach! Even though that weather was great every day we had a great time and Johnny was on hand to answer any questions or provide suggestions on what we could do! Would recommend him and the villa 100%.
50920565,Alice September 2021 This property is like paradise on earth! The location is quiet and quite remote but you can be at restaurants  bars and Corfu Town in a short taxi ride or car journey. However you won’t need to go far from the property as it has everything you need close by in the local area - beautiful beaches  amazing tavernas  fun bars. Johnny is also the perfect host who goes above and beyond to take care of his guests. As for the villa  it is stunning with views you can look at for days. We hope to be coming back!

29890659,Paul September 2021 We liked about Lidovois House the proximity to the sandy beach and a supermarket. The view from the apartment and the terrace is amazing. Parking is possible next to the house. The only thing which could be improved was that there was only one pan without a top and of a very low quality so cooking eggs for breakfast was really hard. Otherwise very nice place.

24343245,Loic August 2022 Nice house  well located on the island  an extra single bed in the bedroom to avoid having to unfold the sofa in the living room every day  air conditioning and WiFi  cleaning done in the middle of the stay (9 days). Fresh eggs  grapes  watermelon and peaches from neighbors  No jacuzzi  a washing machine that only works at 60°
24343245,Denys October 2021 We enjoyed our stay in this house. It is modern and spacious. Location is great  close to all attractions of central part of Corfu island  however away from noise  surrounded by olive garden. All people involved in our stay were excellent: Makis  his parents and friend Samis. Thanks to all of them! Hope to stay there again.
24343245,Viena September 2021 A lovely house surrounded by olive trees. The home itself has everyone one might need for a short or long stay. We stayed for about 10 days and cooked and watched movies (when not at the beach and exploring). The lovely elderly couple who lives next door was most generous by gifting us home made food.
24343245,Nejle July 2021 What a beautiful home! We had a very good time there  everything was perfect
24343245,Guillaume June 2021 Thank you to Makis and his friend Samis. It was a perfect stay. House is well equipped and is lost in beautiful nature. Thank you to Samis who gave us some advices about where to go. Hope to come back one day
24343245,Lucy May 2021 Makis' home is a spacious open plan house. There is a large communal space for hanging out  with a comfy sofa and tv if you want to chill out. The noise carries a lot  something to bear in mind if you are a light sleeper. The 2 terraces are nice for eating breakfast  and one has an incredible view of the landscape . The house is right next to Makis' parents house  so you will see them throughout the day - they were kind enough to drop some eggs off (there are hens in the garden). They also have a very cute dog! The nearest beaches are beautfiul and a short drive away (between 7-13 mins drive). Our favourite was Mirtiotissa (nudist beach - very secluded and nice vibe).
24343245,Philipp October 2020 We had a very great stay at Markis house. You has a nice view and it’s very quit. Nearby the house the are many nice beaches like Pelekas  Glyfada and many more. Mrs. Barbara and her husband are very friendly and very helpfully. If you have questions about good beaches  food or any else you can anytime ask Samis  a Friend of Markis. Thank you all! We would come back any time! Best wishes Philipp
24343245,Anne-Kathrin January 2020 We had wonderful 10 Days at the Island. Makis was a very friendly host and we always had the opportunity to ask  if we needed help/advice/... The house is absolutely wonderful with an amazing view  nice and calm. Perfect for relaxing and exploring the Island. We would definitely recommend!
24343245,Haja September 2019 We had a beautiful holiday in Markis house! Markis house has a very cozy atmosphere  there are everything you need to comfort pastime. The home located on a hill with mountains view. There are a few sandy beach and supermarket close to home. The hostess is very pleasant old woman. She lives in the neighbourhood and helped us for household questions. The man who met us is friendly guy. He helped us to rent a car a also he recommend the place that we needed! We have a good impression of Markis house ! :)
24343245,"Armin September 2019 If you want to spend your holidays on Corfu island  then you have to stay in Makis villa! We had a wonderful and relaxing time there! We did everything right with our decision!  The well equipped villa has two great terraces and is located in a calm but central area of the island. Near to Pelekas  near to the definitely best beach ""Pelekas beach"" and also closely to Corfu town. It is the best starting point for discover the island by car.  The wonderful and lovely parents of Makis living next door. The both are very fantastic people and Makis mum is such a warm and kindly person  who has sweetened our stay! What a wonderful and great mum. Thank you so much for everything!!! Also the friend of Makis  who cares about the guests  was cool  friendly and always achievable. Thank you Samis.  We had perfect holidays and would come back again anytime. Greetings Ceren and Armin."
24343245,Patrice June 2019 We had a wonderful stay at Makis House. His friend who did the check in and his family were lovely. We got fresh eggs and moussaka :) the house itself is very spacious and well equipped.
24343245,Matthes September 2018 Great location in the nicest area of the island! The house is very tastefully furnished and offers a lot of peace and privacy. The hospitality of Makis parents living in the house next door is marvelous. It's only 5 minutes by car to Pelekas and maybe 10 to Pelekas beach. We had a wonderful time and definitely would come back.
24343245,Nima August 2018 Dear Makis and Julia  thank you very much for letting us stay in your house for a couple of days! Great place  very nice house and a lovely mum of Makis who brought us fresh eggs from the own chicken and grapes from the garden. She really made us feel welcome! The location of the house is very good  too. Only a few minutes by car to Pelekas  to the beaches  to supermarkets and about 15-20 min to Corfu town. But you definately need a car. We can highly recommend Makis House for some relaxing holidays on the island Corfu.
24343245,Heloise August 2018 The villa is very spacious and has everything you could need  we had a very good time there. It’s conveniently located to explore the island and the village of Pelekas is within 10 minutes drive.  The hosts are nice and available  and the couple living next door are adorable and caring  they offered us food several times ... the legendary and amazing Greek hospitality:)
24343245,Marco June 2018 A wonderful place  a very comfortable house  a relaxing garden with bbq  nice hosts who take care of 6 cats!
24343245,Benedetta September 2022 The house is beautiful and perfectly reflects the photos and description. Surrounded by greenery  it offers a beautiful view for a relaxing stay away from the chaos of the city  but still within walking distance of all the points of interest on the island. Comfortable house only if provided with a car (20 minutes from downtown Corfu). To make the stay even more wonderful  the availability and tips from Samis  and the sweetness and kindness of the gentlemen who live in the house next door. Despite the bad weather  we were able to enjoy this vacation thanks to the location that allowed us to spend pleasant moments both outside under the large veranda and inside enjoying a hot bath. Translated from Italian  Show original
24343245,Taradel August 2022 Excellent stay. The house is spacious  clean and enjoys a very nice environment  quiet olive trees. Beautiful beaches are located not far from the house. All windows and French doors are equipped with mosquito netting. Communication with Makis is smooth and her parents  who live next door  are very kind and discreet. I highly recommend this accommodation. Translated from French  Show original
24343245,Katja August 2022 We stayed here for the second time and had a wonderful time again. The house is very well located  close to beautiful beaches and the capital. However  a car is recommended. Maki's parents are very warm and hospitable. The communication with Maki's friend for questions was also perfect. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Moritz June 2022 For a trip with a baby  the ideal place for recreation! The neighbors are world class! Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Julia June 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Makis's house! The house is close to the mountain village of Pelekas and only minutes away from the nearest beaches. The distance to Kerkira or other places on the island was also just perfect  so we had a great starting point for our many excursions. Makis' house is very generous  there were only two of us and we were able to spread out well. Right next to the house live Maki's parents  who are very  very nice. His mother Barbara even brought us some stuffed puff pasta bags with feta. There are also some cats and a totally cute dog  the Sissi  at the property. The house is very quiet and we felt very comfortable! You cannot expect to reach the beach within walking distance  you will definitely need a car. But if you have this  you can easily reach all the beautiful places in Corfu. Glad to come back! Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Alexander May 2022 We enjoyed the house  the furnishings and the care very much. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Daniel October 2021 We enjoyed Maki's house very much. The house is very spacious with your large terrace and a beautiful garden. It is well equipped and there was a small guest gift to welcome you. A rental car is absolutely necessary for your stay as it is very remote. But you live in the middle of nature. To very beautiful beaches  however  you can drive only 5-10 minutes. We were always supplied with great fruit from the garden. Our children (2 and 4)were also enthusiastic  they could move freely and quickly became friends with the cats. Mosquito net on all doors and windows  great! We would book this place again anytime. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Katja August 2021 We had a wonderful time at Maki's house. It is very quietly located  but still not far from Corfu city and beautiful beaches. It is also close to the village and some nice taverns. However  a car is highly recommended. We also enjoyed the Greek hospitality. We'd love to come back. Translated from German  Show original
24343245,Marco July 2019 Really nice and functional house  impeccable cleanliness  very quiet and reserved location. A 15-minute drive to Glyfada and Agios Gordios beaches. Perfect assistance. However  highly recommended. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Tetiana September 2022 Nice place! Clean room! We spend great time in late with dancing. So close to beach  but better by car. I recommend this apartment
25889662,Ioannis September 2022 The place was terrible  they don't clean it well and it stinks. Also the next day the cleaning lady woke us up earlier than our check out to leave. As for the cleanliness we even found a dead worm near the eating table. Also in the bathroom the Aeration was full of flies and dust and there was only one big towel.
25889662,Andrew September 2022 I love Pelekas and this little apartment was perfect for my stay! Response from Ελευθερια-Σπύρος October 2022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENT! HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT TIME IN OUR VILLAGE!
25889662,Ana-Maria August 2022 Good value for money! The humidity was indeed very high. Do not recommend to those who have respiratory health issues.
25889662,Monica August 2022 This studio is okay for 2 or 3 days  not longer. Toilet and WiFi don't work at all and the bed is very uncomfortable. The parking for the car is very dangerous.
25889662,Lukáš August 2020 Good
25889662,Leo August 2020 We had a nice time at Elly's Place. Although its a bit humid  its not smelly or dirty. The location is awesome  a typically greek small town with its own touch. The parking lot is rather for a small car. To sum up  we can defenetly recommend this place!
25889662,Jonathan August 2019 You are going to stay in the very center of the village and therefore not going to miss out on a single event going on there. The studio is built into the rocks and thus humid  which means you don’t need to switch on the air conditioner. The bed it ca. 1.40m wide. The people in Pelekas are very friendly and a 24/7 supermarket+bakery is just around the corner.
25889662,Lea August 2019 Nice apartment in the center of nice little town. Too bad it has moisture problems.
25889662,Peter September 2018 Small studio apartment with double bed. Well furnished though lacking basics for two people eg. only 1 mug  only 1 glass.  No wifi and very poor phone signal made it difficult to plan our days.  Shower is difficult to use as due to the drain and layout  it causes the bathroom to flood.  Location is good for Pelekas which has lovely restaurants and a pool bar  however  is a little isolated. Good bus link to the town  though infrequent. Walk to the beach is 30mins minimum and steep. Recommend a car.
25889662,Petr July 2018 Elly and Agnes are very good people and hosts. We had a great experience in Pelekas. The appartments are located in the center of Pelekas and surrounded with lot of of authentic greek tavernas. Agnes taverna is one of the great ones. We liked to have a dinner there  thanks to all who work there. Also apartments are near Casier throne with amazing view on Corfu. You can get to the sea in 20-30 minutes by foot  but you should be a bit trained to walk up back to the Pelakas)))) So consider to rent a car or bike. The sea in Pelekas beach is very clean and beautiful. Also amazing Glyfada beach is near by. We had a true greek vacation and were amazed. Thank you very much!
25889662,Asia July 2022 apartment in beautiful Corfu village very comfortable for the location near many beaches  nice owners and available to check in and out a little Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Victoria July 2022 Great location  it is perfectly connected between two beaches and at night there is a lot of movement  but the lady who brings the towels does not know English and both times she came to bring the towels she came in without our permission (because she also seems to have the keys) even though we had told her to wait since we were not in a position to open them. Apart from the first day there was never hot water and you feel everything as if the walls were made of paper  we had also left (and we are 100% sure) of the valuable sunglasses in the room but we didn't find them again and I really checked so well because I really keep order. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Flor June 2022 Pelekas was well located  close to the beach but walking up and down. The bus used to pass every other hour and in 20 you get downtown. Very nice room but too much humidity  the clothes don't dry and everything gets wet. There were no cleaning products making it difficult to maintain even though the cleaning staff arrived every day. We didn't have hot water for 3 days and we were told it was an island issue without coming to check  but it turns out that there was an electric water heater and the knob was off. The bed was extremely uncomfortable  the mattress expired and all the springs were noticeable. The only mini market that had a lot of things was overdue so pay attention. The WiFi was really bad.

25889662,Lucas September 2021 Very nice studio  located in a village where people are very nice  helpful  and available! The studio itself is very suitable  it lacks light and is a little damp because of it but nothing very bad. Great value for money! A few hot water outages that impacted the entire village during our stay  but there still not in the owner's control:) We had a pleasant stay. Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Zélie August 2021 Several problems during our stay: - High humidity in the apartment (the linen does not dry: annoying after a day of beach  smell of contained  moldy shower curtains) - Uncomfortable mattress (probably sprung) - Very bad communication with the host  she was not responding to our messages  we had to call or go to her place of work to talk to her - So mentioned in the host's listing  a lot of essential amenities were missing (shampoo  salt  sponge  dishwashing liquid  olive oil...). We had to show the host where she had mentioned these amenities so she could provide them to us otherwise she barely believed us!! - We had a very bad connection and had access to wifi the second last day (over a week-long stay) - No cleaning equipment is present in the listing. When you stay a week  you sometimes like to sweep to clean the apartment. - Presence of insects  Pros: - clean linen - air conditioning - accommodation in the center of the village Show more Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Iona August 2021 The house is really very nice and new  as in the pictures. The only problem is the humidity  which is really high although we had the air conditioning on for a long time  things don't dry. Wifi connection outside the apartment (it was only connected outside the apartment). They didn't give us the wifi password of the apartment saying that an old tenant had changed it and they didn't know it. They promised a technician who never arrived. Translated from Spanish  Show original
25889662,Guillaume July 2021 Charming little studio with exposed stone  in the center of one of the best villages in Corfu. The host is responsive and also sent a cleaner without us asking for anything which is really adorable. However  be careful about the humidity that some people in some people can be a problem. Well we had a wonderful stay anyway. Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Δώρα July 2019 The room is in a quite good location  with easy access to many beaches. Beautiful and clean space  however the room was very humid!! Translated from Greek  Show original
25889662,Jacopo July 2019 The location is excellent  the small town of Pelakes allows you to easily reach the most beautiful beaches and the center of Corfu. The apartment is well furnished and clean  great if you are two. July is very kind and helpful. Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Deborah August 2018 Everything was very clean and efficient. Excellent and comfortable location  beautiful and quiet area. Translated from Italian  Show original
25889662,Fanny July 2018 Elly's apartment is very well located on the island and we had a nice stay there. Good value for money. Do not be overly demanding. The low price compensates for the few violations (no shower curtain  lack of ventilation  too much humidity) that it seems possible to improve. We were hosted very well by Elly's family. The village is very nice and lively in the evening (several restaurants and bars). Translated from French  Show original
25889662,Stefano July 2018 The place is a very small studio located in a nice busy village at night. There is no wifi and it does not take the mobile network  there are no windows  resulting in the smell of closed and humidity  there is no place outside to be able to stay with a coffee table  no drying racks or other things to dry clothes and linens  the shower without a curtain lock floods the bathroom  lack of any type of sponge  soap  broom and lack of cutlery  glasses  plates and pots for cooking. Very good location  parking  air conditioning and LED TV. Translated from Italian  Show original
41944666,Nourlhouda September 2021 The villa is great with an amazing vieuw on the montains ! We have enjoyed our stay. There was everything we needed and more. The hosts were very friendly. There is a private pool for the summer heat. The garden is so cozy and perfectly decorated. If you're searching for a typical greec vacation this is the place to go!
41944666,Kozachenko August 2021 We enjoyed staying at the place very much! The villa was super tidy and comfortable both inside and outside  it’s clear that the owner really cares about the guests’ comfort. We came late in the evening due to our flight delay  and were treated with a homemade supper! Chilling in the pool  making bbq  having breakfast or a glass of wine on the terrace listening to the sounds of nature we’re more than pleasant.
41944666,Joaquin July 2021 Everything was absolutely perfect! Zoi is a great host. The house has everything you may need and more! Perfect location  beautifully decorated  swimming pool  garden  etc.
5941318,Sofia August 2022 A pretty basic stay  if you are just visiting. The apartment had all the mentioned amenities  except from wifi. Slightly different than the photos. There were some beach essentials available but they weren't needed  as we had our own. Wouldn't recommend for more than 3 people and for large vehicle owners
5941318,Aimee August 2022 We had an amazing stay at Kelly’s. The place is beautiful with so much to do. Buses are regular and take you all around the island. Well worth the money. Very sad to be leaving.
5941318,Angel July 2022 Kelly and Joe are very very kind  they have been worried for us during all the stay. The only bad thing I could say about the place is that the pool has too much cloro for us. But the rest has been awesome!
5941318,Torgunn July 2022 We had a nice stay at Kellys apartment  and she let me check in early the day I arrived. The apartment is well eqipped  has good space  a cosy balcony and a wonderful pool. The annoncement on Airbnb are a bit misleading though. There was no internet/wifi. We could use the neighbours  which was unstable. There is no shuttlebus to the beach. There were no sunbeds at the pool which belonged to this apartment  I didn't know and accidentally used the neighbours. Kelly and Joe kept saying they should fix the internet and buy sunbeds during our stay  with no result. The neighbours were very friendly and helpful.
5941318,Marko June 2022 The apartment is about 10 minutes walk from Pelekas. This makes her very calm. It was clean  unfortunately the wifi didn't work. The pool is a highlight.
5941318,Marios December 2021 Well  miss Kelly wasnt here to help us but we had some communication through messages.
5941318,Rose September 2020 The apartment has beautiful views  a lovely pool (deep and not too chlorinated). The apartment itself is reasonably basic  but great value for money and frankly all you need when you’re going to be outside most of the time anyway. The area is lovely but everything is uphill so you really need to be driving/hire a scooter to get around  or be prepared to walk up a lot of hills! The neighbours are super friendly. Would definitely recommend.
5941318,Liz August 2020 A lovely little apartment just the right size for me and my daughter. Much cooler than I thought it would be but you do need the fan on. Lovely location used the pool and most days no one there. Didn’t have car but we like walking  if you want to go around island you would need car. Some lovely restaurants at the top of the hill. Went to beach twice no taxis available so expect without a car to climb a very big hill. Great place for the price and especially if you want some quiet time  lovely to sit on balcony in the morning to watch the sun rise
5941318,Francesco July 2020 Please note that this apartment does not have wifi and AC. The freezer was broker and the fridge didn't work properly. It might be good only for a very short stay  until these issues will be solved.
5941318,Giuly February 2020 Really bad communication!! At the last minute when it was time to give me the key she text me after many time that I try to contact her and she told me that the apartments was not available ! Really bad experience . Don’t go
5941318,Nora September 2019 Perfect position
5941318,Frances September 2019 Lovely location and the pool is great. A walk up to the village is worth the effort and there are many bars and restaurants close by. Corfu town by bus is also a good option.
5941318,Daan July 2019 An amazing experience; great location  beautiful pool and very hospitable cleaning service!
5941318,Talitha July 2019 A really lovely little apartment. Any problems that arose were dealt with quickly and kindly. The pool was mostly quiet and relaxing and the apartment itself was nicer in person than shown in the pictures. A short walk from the bus station and pelekas center which is very sweet. Really happy with our stay  would definitely recommend.
5941318,Dylan June 2019 A most enjoyable stay. Would come again.
5941318,Elena June 2019 If you need a complete rest from work  city noise  communication and stress  then this place is for you. Incredible  magical place for a good holiday. Very quiet  cozy  comfortable. It seems that you are away from everything and really enjoy your vacation. If you need the sea  then you can take a car  walk or bus. Nearby there is everything you need - shops  cafes  restaurants. But the main thing is that the house is in peace and quiet. Good apartments have everything you need to live. This is a really cool place and I will choose it for myself next time!
5941318,Andarachi August 2018 We had a great time and remained very happy and satisfield with our choice about the place.Kelly replied very quik at messagies and always ready to help.Everithing was as described.We recomend.
5941318,David July 2018 A lovely apartment  beautiful views and within easy walking distance of a very friendly village. I would love to stay here again.
5941318,Alison June 2018 Great place to stay if you want a typical Greek village   good places to eat   near the coast and a regular bus service ( 15/20 mins ) to Corfu town for 1 Euro 70. Kellys place was well equipped   plenty of hot water with towels and pool towels included. More space than the average holiday apartment with a balcony with amazing views. The walk up to the village was about 15 / 20 mins   take your torch for your walk back after dark. A good choice of Tavernas in the village but The Stavrodromi Taverna at the crossroads was our favourite . A simple menu  quality ingredients   well cooked and great friendly service. Hire a bike to see the local villages if you can.
5941318,Bee September 2017 We had a really lovely stay in Corfu  made better by the great location and ease of Kellys accommodation. It's in a perfect spot to be able to explore the island - we hired a car (company recommended by Kelly) and travelled around lots of different beaches and villages. The apartment is located in walking distance (albeit steep!) to a lovely village (Pelekas) which had great restaurants. We particularly liked 'Roula Taverna' which has the best Souvlaki in Corfu! The apartment was clean  tidy and had everything we needed for our short stay. The swimming pool was deserted most days - a real luxury! Great value apartment.
5941318,Dawn June 2017 Wonderful position with breathtaking views. Fantastic host offering a great stay.
5941318,Colin April 2017 Excellent place to explore Corfu from.  Easy to get to from the Airport.  Flexible checking in - I didn't arrive until nearly midnight with no problems checking in.  Nice quiet  central location to explore the whole island.  Fantastic view from the balcony to enjoy in the morning and evening.  Excellent comms from Kelly and a very stress free stay.
5941318,Simon January 2017 Kelly's place is well equipped and in a beautiful location. Great to watch the sunrise every morning from the second floor! Communication with Kelly was a breeze  and the apartment was well looked after. We stayed over Christmas which meant Pelekas was a very sleepy town with no open restaurants  but the locals were friendly and always good for a chat. During summer I imagine it would be quite the happening place! If you stay here be sure to take the path up the mountain behind the apartment  and go to Kaiser's throne to watch the sunset at least once.
5941318,Justyna September 2016 Kelly is the best host ! We knew everything  she gave us all information   tips and help in every question about Corfu. I really recommend this place  its cheap and there is even more than in description.  Pelekas is such a nice village  people are so friendly !
5941318,Paul September 2016 Nice apartment  ideal for 2 persons  easy to reach from the airport. We didn´t use the pool because the sea was just too nice and clear and warm. Check out Yaliskari beach and the taverna and the Zanzibar in Pelekas ;)
5941318,Barbora August 2016 Kelly is very nice and helpful person. We stayed in Kelly's apartment for 7 nights and we really enjoyed this holiday. Apartment was clean with a perfect location. Pelekas city si small city full of friendly people and good restaurants. I was with my boyfriend and 2 other friends so 2 of us slept on the bed upstairs and two on sofa. Sofa wasnt so comfortable for two adults but we put a mattress on the floor and finally we slept well :) . Weather was perfect and we really liked beaches and nature around. We rented bikes and boat what I really recommend. The bus didnt go to the beach so it is good to rent some bike and see more of the west coast which has so many amazing views. Like I said we ve also rented a boat for one day and we have visited some private beaches what was a big experience  unfortunately there were big vawes and really hot so 3 of us were out for the next 2 days because of heatstroke or sea sick I dont know :D but anyway we really enjoyed this holiday like I said and I can only recommend this place. Kelly thank you very much! Corfu is amazing! Response from Kelly August 2016 Thank you very much for your lovely review I really appreciate it. I'm glad you had a good time at the apartment and that you enjoyed Corfu. Kelly
5941318,Yasmin August 2016 Kelly was such a brilliant and trustworthy host  always tending to our queries with speed and politeness. The apartment was just as expected and Kelly even let us check in a bit early and coordinated with the cleaners to suit our arrival. The apartment also had a lovely pool with fantastic views over Corfu. Pelekas village is very traditionally Greek with wonderful tavernas and the kaisers throne viewing point (a must-see) with views over the whole of Corfu  this is only a 20 minute walk from the apartment to the top. The only downside was that the water would sometimes cut out  but this was no fault of the apartment! One of the fans were broken so we could only use one fan during the evening which meant the room was pretty hot. It was quite a steep and far walk down to the beach (not for the faint hearted) but the only issue is getting back up. We managed to flag down car lifts which was fantastic! There is also a bus that goes straight from pelekas village to Corfu town  so a 30 minute bus journey to the town  buses were timely. To conclude  it was a very pleasant stay! Thank you Kelly! Response from Kelly August 2016 Thank you very much for your great review! I'm sorry one of the fans was broken  if you had let me know I would have asked the cleaner to replace it. I'm glad that the water cutting out didn't affect your stay too much  apparently it has been happening all over the island this summer. I'm glad you enjoyed the apartment and Pelekas overall.

5941318,Richard July 2016 Great location to explore Corfu. Kelly was really helpful and gave great recommendations of things to do in the area. Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks for your review  glad you liked my recommendations and that you had a good time Kelly
5941318,Mara July 2016 I Response from Kelly July 2016 I'm sorry that the water went off. As I told you  the local council switch the water off when they are working on utilities and obviously I have no control over that. It would have been the same for the whole area not just our block. It doesn't happen very often you were just unfortunate in that regard. I hope you enjoyed your holiday apart from that issue. Kelly Show more
5941318,Katie July 2016 Kelly you couldnt have been more helpful! Our stay was fantastic! Thank you so much! Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks very much for your review  I'm glad you had a good time!
5941318,Hayley June 2016 Kelly is communicative and helpful and the apartment is great. It is tucked away on the hillside of Pelekas  in my opinion one of the best places to stay on Corfu. We enjoyed the walk to Pelekas beach as much as the beach itself  we didn't bother with the minibus. The charming village is up a steep hill but we are fit and it only took us 5 minutes. The apartment was well equipped and clean. The views from the balcony and bedroom are wonderful. Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks you for your very nice review.
5941318,Feyza May 2016 We really enjoyed our stay at the apartment and it exceeded our expectations in many ways. It was super conveniently located near the charming village of Pelekas with stunning views from the balcony overlooking the sea and mountains of Corfu. Kelly was a very responsive and gracious host. Response from Kelly May 2016 Thank you very much for your kind review  I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
5941318,Richard August 2015 We very much enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The neighbours were friendly and helpful and we very rarely had to share the large swimming pool with anyone. Location is perfect only a couple of minutes drive to Pelekas village or a short walk through the olive grove. There is a lovely breeze through the apartment during the day and stunning views over to Corfu Town and Albania from the balcony. The kitchen is small but adequate  hot water in the shower and fresh towels and bedding brought by the cleaner weekly. Comfortable bed  plenty of storage and the sofa downstairs can be converted so it can sleep four people comfortably. Highly recommended.
5941318,Sofia July 2022 Very nice contact person. Responded quickly. The pool is great. Translated from German  Show original
5941318,Oscar August 2019 The location is perfect for touring the whole island. And Pelekas is a village with all the amenities and cozy. Translated from Spanish  Show original
5941318,Sara August 2019 Great house located in the middle of the island so we had everything relatively close. Translated from Spanish  Show original
5941318,Guillaume October 2018 Beautiful apartment ideally located for visiting the whole island from north to south. Comfortable and well-equipped  check-in is allowed at any time with the very convenient lockbox. No complaints  everything was very good  excellent value for money! Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Jean-Luc September 2018 The pool and the view are nice but we were very disappointed with the amenities of the apartment which is very insufficient   I hope Kelly can correct this accumulation of small problems for who spoils the stay a little: no sunbeds or deckchairs (unlike the other apartments and the pool tiles are not very comfortable!)  no table on the balcony  the light from the balcony and landing was not working (I had to repair it on the balcony with difficulty because there is not even a stool)  the front door closes badly (obligation to lock it if you don't want to see it open on its own)  the refrigerator door does not close (it had to be stuck with an object)  the freezer door is set  zero shelves  no furniture to place or store things in the living room  we had to place them on the floor  no hooks in the apartment to hang clothes (not even in the room bath)  no chair  no bedside lamp in the bedroom  the box spring squeaks with the slightest movement  no oven or microwave to warm up dishes. No countertop to place dishes in the kitchen  a tiny Italian coffee maker (you can't make coffee for 2!)  only 2 forks!  no ironing table or mat  the outdoor washing machine is completely rusty  no hair dryer. Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Laura June 2018 Unfortunately  I can't say that the place is a good fit for a pleasant stay. The bathroom when we arrived was broken. The lockbox did not work properly and we were locked out at 11pm. The house is suitable for 2 people because it is very small  the refrigerator and kitchen old and rusty  as is the washing machine. There is no parking and it is far from the main road. Translated from Italian  Show original
5941318,Anton June 2018 We liked it. Translated from German  Show original
5941318,Sandrine September 2017 Kelly's place is even nicer in person than in photos and very clean. You will find everything you need to make your stay pleasant (cooking utensils  iron and others...like at home ) a nice pool always clean Kelly is very nice and available if needed. you have a shortcut on foot in front of the apartment that leads to the village of Pelekas 10 minutes away .

5941318,Hervé July 2017 The accommodation perfectly met our expectations (quiet location  nice view and sufficient services). The pool is a real plus. The rental is professional. For a perfect service  we can advise our host to change the mattress a little soft for our taste and the addition of mosquito nets even though many mosquito repellent spreaders are available. Do not hesitate to be made clear about the access that is difficult to find when you don't know Translated from French  Show original
5941318,Danielle September 2016 Spacious apartment  beautiful balcony and a large swimming pool. Location was also good  close to a nice village (10 min walk)  It could have been a little cleaner  sheets and towels were clean. Bathroom was a bit small and inconvenient  but fine for the two of us.  Translated from Dutch  Show original
5941318,Jade September 2016 Kelly is always in contact with us and always ready to answer questions quickly. Very nice accommodation with a swimming pool. We're glad you're here. Translated from French  Show original Response from Kelly September 2016 Thanks for your nice review
5941318,Elisabeth August 2016 We liked the apartment near Pelekas very much. It had everything you needed. There is also a clean pool where you can refresh yourself. The area is rather quiet  it takes ten to fifteen minutes to walk to Pelekas. To explore the island a rental car is perfect. Pelekas is close to the airport in central Corfu  so you can take a car to the south  sometimes to the north. The host  Kelly  was very keen to ensure that we had a smooth process. She was always approachable and we were well informed. All in all  a great apartment in a great area! Highly recommended! Translated from German  Show original Response from Kelly September 2016 Thanks very much for your nice review.
5941318,Marinte July 2016 It is a small but super nice apartment. From parking  it is a bit of a walk up. If you can't walk well  I just couldn't advise. It is quietly located  but close to the village! Balcony is lovely in the shade and has a beautiful view. We had a nice time there. Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Kelly July 2016 Thanks for your review
5941318,Maggie June 2016 What a lovely place. The apartment has a nice balcony where we enjoyed a magnificent view. I felt surrounded by natural beauty and the sound of the crickets. Swallows drinking from the pool and that was a special experience (so don't put on too much sunscreen). The pool is clean and nice. The place has something magical  we enjoyed it here. Kelly responds to every message quickly and kindly. Nothing's too much for her. The surroundings are great. Beautiful beaches and a cute village nearby. For the beaches you need a car. Please bring a mosquito net so the windows can open when it gets hot upstairs. I have particularly good memories of this place and we will definitely be back! Translated from Dutch  Show original Response from Kelly June 2016 Thanks you for your lovely review  I'm glad you had a good time. Thanks for letting the apartment in very good condition  you are welcome back anytime and I have recommended you to other hosts. Kelly Show more

45191410,Sarah December 2022 We were on a walking holiday out of season. The flat was well located for the Corfu Trail. Just off the main square and close to a lovely bakery  a shop and small bar that were open out of season. The accommodation was comfortable and spacious. The kitchen had limited utensils but enough for pasta and sauce. The welcome we received was kind and warm. We arrived early but this was no problem.
45191410,Francesca September 2022 I would recommend this apartment highly   beautiful views and a very friendly village   hosts are very friendly and are on hand to help with any concerns or needs.
45191410,Sheena September 2022 Really nice apartment and good location! Response from Ελευθερια-Σπύρος October 2022 THANK YOU VERY MUCH! HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!
45191410,Ishan August 2022 a perfect vacation home  the owner is very helpful and flexible  room was clean and every description was accurate. We loved it.
45191410,Paola June 2022 The apartment is very well situated in Pelekas downtown  nearby a bakery ne good restaurants. But if you are looking for a place to stay several days  I would not recommend this town. It is far from the beach (accessible only by car) and it is very difficult to find a place to park the car.  The apartment was ok  but several things can be improved in the kitchen (old electrical stove  not easy to cook with it) and in the bathroom (water leaks and no shower curtain...) The room is very confortable and the air conditioner works very well. Beware that there are stairs to in and out from the appartement... not so practical if you need a easy access.
45191410,Marina October 2021 Elle hosted us in very last minute while the whole island was in danger for heavy rainfalls over the whole day   we were very thankful that we could stay in her cosy apartment which is in the old part of the village very central situated . We can recommend this place for hiking and walks to the beach ...
45191410,Imran September 2021 Amazing location. Access to a lot of restaurants  and beautiful views. Hard to get a bus to get around but nothing like a good cardio. wifi is my only complaint but we managed
45191410,Fanny September 2021 Cute appartement  very well located  in the middle of everything! Felt like a local !
45191410,Cristina September 2021 Elli was really nice and kind and the apartment is so cute!
45191410,Karolína August 2021 Nice apartment
45191410,Inês August 2021 Nice apartment right in the center of pelekas. Everything was well decorated  however the shower isn’t very practical.
45191410,Fabienne August 2021 Well located in a beautiful mountain village. Good infrastructure. Recommend.
45191410,Becca August 2021 All in all  a decent value for the money. Pelekas is a very cute village and the bnb is close to a lovely cafe  some great restaurants  and a nice bar. It is a HIKE down to and up from the beach  so I HIGHLY recommend renting a scooter or a car. The space is pretty chic and comfortable. The AC is in the living room and it was kind of difficult for it to cool down the bedroom. If you are sensitive to sound  the close by bar plays music until pretty late. The wifi was weak at around 0.5-2mbps. The nearby beaches are beautiful and have some beach bars/tavernas for food and drinks. I would recommend this place for budget travelers!
45191410,Merima August 2021 Pelekas is beautiful and the surrounding beach as well. The airbnb is comfortable and nice. We didn't cook anything there  so can't say much about that experience. There is a wonderful bakery right in front of the apartment for some breakfast or just a coffee to go :)  The host only accomodates the key exchange  so don't expect to receive some hospitality or anything like that. And also  there was music from the neighboring bar until 2 AM on both evenings (sat + sun) we were there so wasn't as quiet as I expected. But maybe this is just everywhere in Corfu.
45191410,Maïa July 2021 Very good location  the village is very Nice ! The apartement is lovely and clean. Maybe small for 4 people.
45191410,Altan July 2021 Nice apartment close to restaurants shops etc. Comfortable bed and good aircon
45191410,Gabriela July 2021 Really great host. Very responsive and helpful before we arrived. The apartment was as expected from the description and the photos  in an old building it has been beautifully renovated with a modern looking living /dining room and bedroom. Would definitely recommend to a couple  it has everything you need in a very good location. Kontogialos beach is a 3 minute drive and very close to Pelekas Square with a couple of cafés and bars.
45191410,Fatima June 2021 Great location & cute spot!
45191410,Spersa March 2021 It is a nice place in a traditional village  tastefully furniture and a nice and calm place to stay.
45191410,Matthew October 2020 So close to the village square with the cafe  the bakery and the grocery store. A good restaurant just a few metres up the hill too. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to get to know 'inner Corfu'.
45191410,Bronagh September 2020 This is such a beautiful apartment. Tastefully decorated and modern. It's a very pleasant space ideal for a single person or a couple. The location is perfect just a minutes walk from the square in Pelekas so close to all amenities  coffee shops  bars and the family also own the local supermarket so anything you might want is right there. If you need anything for the apartment they are only too happy to provide. Very nice family hosts. I would highly recommend and I will probably try to book it again next time I come - it its available as I guess it will be very popular. Ten out of ten!

45191410,Marina October 2022 THE ROOM NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT. LIKE A LOCATION IT'S VERY NICE. BUT OUR STAY WASN'T AS EXPECTED. THE MATTRESS IS BELOW THE MEASURE   THERE WERE NO BASIC AMENITIES LIKE A SHOWER CURTAIN WITH THE EFFECT OF FILLING WATER OUT OR WE COULD NOT COLLECT THEM AS THERE WAS NO MOANING.

45191410,Olaf June 2022 Very good location right on the main square and at the church in Pelekas. In the apartment  the living room is very nicely decorated with a great picture as an eye-catcher. The bedroom is also very nice with a very nice view of the square and the church. However  the kitchen is not so well equipped and the fridge is quite old. The bathroom is missing a shower curtain. Nevertheless  we felt comfortable and the check-in was very straightforward and friendly. Translated from German  Show original
45191410,Dominik May 2022 Good accommodation in central location of Pelekas. Value for money was great. Amenities in the kitchen a bit low; but sufficient for preparing breakfast. On Friday  the music from the street was already very loud. Cleanliness was a bit tricky as there is a lot of animal hair on the carpets. Translated from German  Show original
45191410,Thomas October 2021 Very well located apartment. In the lively village  next to everything  restaurants  bars  grocery store  10 minutes' walk from the top of the mountain where you can see the whole island at 360 it's incredible. The apartment is simple. Bathroom and basic kitchen. Mattress too soft for our taste. The wifi was great. The views are stunning. Translated from French  Show original

45191410,Simone September 2020 Very nice and modern place to stay. Unfortunately  the bed is a bit uncomfortable - but that's a matter of taste - as you like. The shower is a bit unfortunate - when showering you flood the bathroom. A rubber puller would be beneficial here. But all in one great place to stay. Nice bars/restaurants/bakers nearby. Even a minimal sea view gives the room. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Jana October 2022 Theo is an extremely accommodating and helpful host. We booked our stay in the morning and checked in by the afternoon. Although Theo was not at home  he handled everything with us remotely. The house is charming  the location wonderful  beautiful garden and fantastic views  well equipped kitchen. You need to bring a car but there are several restaurants  bakeries  shops and everything you need right in the village. The nearest beach is about 1 5 km  so 30min walk  but 5 min by car.
25457177,Roberta July 2022 Intimate and really cute studio  perfect for a couple.. the garden and the outside spaces were wonderful. Theo is really friendly  attentive and available. The position is really good  just 10 minutes from Glyfada and Kontogialos. Recommended!
25457177,Augustė April 2022 We are really pleased with our stay in this little studio apartment! We arrived at the time of Greek Easter  the hosts were really kind to share their festive foods with us. The apartment had fresh lavanders in the vase which make the guests feel welcome  and the garden view… breathtaking! I would definately recommend this studio for a couple that wishes to have a cozy place for a very affordable price.
25457177,Dimitrios September 2021 excellent accomodations. good family business . I highly recommend it.
25457177,Sofie July 2021 That was a really great stay at an amazing accomodation. The localisation is great and really chill. Theo  the host  is always available to help and really welcoming and friendly !
25457177,Yishai July 2021 We had a wonderful stay  the place is beautiful and in a great location. Theofilos and his family were very friendly and helpful. Thank you! Highly recommended

25457177,Paul May 2021 Great Location for work- or vacation :) It's quiet and peaceful with great views all around. But you can also reach most other parts of the island within a 20-30 minute (scenic) drive. Theo and his family are welcoming and even let me stay in a bigger apartment since the tourist season had not really started. 5 stars!
25457177,Oleksii September 2019 We stayed in a studio room  which is small at the first sight but actually it's size is perfect if you don't plan to stay in the room for long time. We had our meals at the terrace which is really cozy. The AC is a fan in reality but it does it's job  so it wasn't hot there (in August-September). Just make sure to leave the windows open.  The village itself is really great. We explored the island by car  and seen a lot of other places  so we know what we're saying. :) It has local heritage and everything you might need is there. The nearest beaches are also really nice. The one we enjoyed the most of them is Gyaliskari.  Perfect place to stay. Kerkira is close  nice beaches near and it's a great starting point for your trips around the island. Just rent a car. By the way the parking spot is right near the house and always has places which is a great bonus.  We wouldn't hesitate to book the same place the next time we'll be on Corfu. :)
25457177,Isabel October 2018 We had a great time in Pelekas at the house of Theofilos. The room was clean and tidy  even very late check - in was possible  very kind hosts  great terrace and garden. Because of the location it's a perfect choice for those who don't want to stay in the city  but also like to explore the island. Ask for an route description in advance :)
25457177,Patrice September 2018 Good place  calm and beautiful. Studio has a good quality/price ratio. Corfou has several beautiful places to visit  some beautiful beaches. Corfou has also lot of tourists  so sometimes like in kerkyra or paleokastritsa  you really have the feeling to be à tourist  for price and for relation ship. When doing abstraction of this  you can spend some good Time. My advice  avoid summer monthes and go far from Big cities.
25457177,Pascal November 2022 Well-located rental  simple but sufficient for what was expected. The location makes it easy to travel around the island. We're never more than an hour away from the sites. Special mention for the many very cuddly cats that often come to visit us. The rental met our expectations. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,"Teresa October 2022 Pleasant contact  quick answers and great suggestions on what and where to go. The location and the house are beautiful and away from the tourist troubles  which is very pleasant. Kaisers Throne is within walking distance  and so are the beaches. If you have time to drive a little further away  the restaurant in the southwest of Corfu (Argirades) ""El cielo"" is highly recommended!!! Great to connect with a trip to Paxos Translated from German  Show original"
25457177,Zina August 2022 The room was fine-but the landlord writes on his side that it's close to the beach. It's not. It was 2km up on a mountain  which made it impossible to get to the beach without a car. He had plenty of cats  we had to throw out of our apartment many times. So I think a little more accurate description was missing Translated from Danish  Show original
25457177,Rebeca July 2022 Very friendly and helpful. Cozy apartment with amazing views. We do not recommend renting it without a car as buses do not pass by when they should. Otherwise everything was correct  well located within the small town. Translated from Spanish  Show original
25457177,Guillaume July 2022 Very well located location on the island  20 min drive from the city center  also easy to visit north and south of the island from this place. Cat lovers will be delighted to have a dozen cats living in the garden. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,Giovanna July 2022 Pelekas is a very nice and quiet country. It's worth staying here  especially since you can visit the whole island without crossing too many mountains. The apartment is very nice and has everything you need. Beautiful garden and full of very polite cats. Recommended:) Translated from Italian  Show original
25457177,Hanna May 2022 Great location to the beach and also some good taverns are within walking distance! Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Lisa May 2022 Nice place and location to stay  with a nice garden and very friendly host. Don't expect much from the studio  for two adults with two suitcases it is very small  but the price is also to that. It's quite noisy and the humidity rate is high. If you plan to not be in the apartment much and love basic this is a great place to stay. It is a good base to explore all the places of the beautiful island! Translated from Dutch  Show original
25457177,Katharina October 2021 The property is in a great location for excursions on the island. To the city 20 minutes and to various beaches about 10 minutes each by car.

25457177,Alisa August 2020 A great airbnb with a wonderful view of the ocean. The hosts were super nice and always helped us with questions. The room (studio) in itself is small but nice and perfect for 2 people. The shower was a bit uncomfortable and you had to get used to it but nothing that somehow stands out as super negative. We are very satisfied! A little tip: take mosquito spray with you! This makes your vacation a little more relaxed ;). Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Joop August 2020 Great Airbnb. Super location in a very pleasant neighborhood with some restaurants and not far to the beach. Theo's mother welcomed us and was very accommodating. We were able to approach them with all our questions. All in all highly recommended! ((: Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Daniel August 2020 Fantastic location  very nice people.  The location was almost perfect because it was quite centrally located. Be sure to book a rental car! This accommodation is perfect for seeing as much of Corfu as possible  we drove good 500 kilometers in 7 days. The accommodation only served as a sleeping space and it was sufficient for that. By car  you have the choice to be at least 3 different beaches within 5 minutes  also the old town and the airport are only 25 minutes away by car.  Only the cleanliness of the rooms had air upstairs. Hair in the bathroom on arrival is a no-go  but it may also not be seen so tightly in the area (Pelekas). Still  it can't be. Had it not been for the location and we would have occupied the accommodation more  it would not have received 4 stars for this.  Otherwise great  also super nice people (mother & son).

25457177,Shirani September 2019 We spent 10 days at the house Lemoni at the end of September. The studio is very small but has everything you need. The garden overlooking the sea is beautiful  and we also totally liked Pelekas with its many small tavernas and great views. You can walk to the beach (Pelekas Beach) for about half an hour and there is a bus connection to Corfu town. But to see a little more of the island  a scooter or rental car makes sense. We didn't meet Theo during our stay  but his parents and many little baby cats:) We felt very comfortable and would definitely come back! Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Joanna September 2019 Small apartment  but suitable for two. A large patio next to an old tree. There's a family of cats in the house. There were 11 of them! Stunning sea views and verdant cliffs. Scenic drives down about 1-1.5 miles to a beautiful beach. Translated from Polish  Show original

25457177,Thelma July 2019 The accommodation and location are pleasant. Easy access by bus. Good value for money. Only the accommodation is very humid  there are many cats in front of the door who try to get in and bathroom a little disappointing. However  the village is very nice and despite an absent host  the person who opened us was very pleasant. Translated from French  Show original
25457177,Nina June 2019 The studio in the house Lemoni was very nice and cozy  everything you need was there  and we also liked to sit in the sun loungers in front of the house overlooking the sea or on the terrace in front of the studio. The village of Pelekas is also very nice and we got around Corfu even without a rental car. The accommodation is for people who like it quiet and who like to share a double bed. The studio is small  but you don't need more space. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Annerose & Werner October 2018 Very tastefully decorated. Translated from German  Show original
25457177,Claudia September 2018 Small but with all the essentials! The studio has an outdoor area with a coffee table where you can eat and the area is very quiet  close to restaurants  a few kilometers from the sea and central to the island. Translated from Italian  Show original

49740616,Flora July 2022 Beautiful spot  super nice hosts  comfortable beds  the terrace is perfect and our baby could crawl all over the place. The beach is great  clean and beautiful. Our kids loved it. It is quite a busy spot and you can hear the music from the bar next door which was a little loud at times. But they turned it off early. Alltogether a very good experience!
49740616,Siya June 2022 Very nice house located at the beach of Kontogialos. All necessities are available. The hosts are friendly and nice. Good value for money.
49740616,Tibor September 2021 If this were in California  it would be Malibu. The house stands right at the sandy beach on the hill which makes this apartment very unique. A narrow private access leads the hill down to the parking. Bars and tavernas offer food and drink  and also you can rent umbrellas and sun beds. Those you like karaoke  the neighbouring bar is very close.
49740616,Hanna September 2021 Thank you for a perfect holiday with a warm welcome  and an outstanding spot with great views and private beach access. Swimming before breakfast in cristall clear water and fruits from the garden make it especially nice.
49740616,Julien August 2022 Very nice apartment facing the beach. The view is magnificent and close to this one (max 50 meters by a private path.)  The access road to the apartment is a peak by car and 30 minutes from the airport and the city of Corfu so it is well located.  The air conditioning and internet are functional. Linens and towels are provided on request without charge. The owners live right above so it's quite simple for check-in.  When it comes to areas to improve: a sunbed on the terrace would be great  the essentials deserve to be more  such as toilet paper  dishwashing products to last for the duration of your stay.  it should be noted that the nearby beach bars are noisy some days / evenings but it is sumptuous. I recommend  it. 😀 Show more Translated from French  Show original
49740616,Franziska August 2022 Fantastic location! The apartment is right on the beach  so we could fall asleep to waves. There is everything you need  even an air conditioner and mosquito nets on all the windows and doors. Communication worked out well and went very quickly. We were very warmly welcomed and would come back any time. Translated from German  Show original
49740616,Marco July 2022 Apartment perfect for family with two children. Direct access to the sea  just 50 meters away! Obviously beautiful sea view. Sparkling clean. Welcoming and friendly guests… Great cake from the hostess! Translated from Italian  Show original
49740616,Christelle May 2022 we had a great time. the rental is very good and clean . our plane was taking off late at night . and the owner allowed us to stay longer . the owner's sister is on site . She's very nice . the sea is 30 meters from the house . i recommend this rental . There is everything nearby  small market   restaurant  etc. Translated from French  Show original
49740616,Khaty May 2022 Really adorable hospitality and presence 🙏The Greek hospitality of lovely hosts is waiting for you  and the place is unique! Tavernas and a supermarket nearby. Everything is perfect! Ps: You need a car ( the climbs are steep!) Translated from French  Show original
50923824,Rūta September 2022 Our family of 4 people stayed in apartament B  it is two bedroom apartament with seperate kitchen. Everything was clean  spacious kitchen  view frim the terase to the sunset  beautiful simple greek house. House owners are greeks they dont speek english but we used translator and everyting we needed we got it. They let to grill on tje terace. The best thing about the house is the location 5-7 min walk down the hill to the nice and calm beach. 2 min to the local shop:)
50923824,Marc September 2022 Nice patio with nice view  short walk to beach  store 2 min away  clean place  friendly caretakers speaking Greek. No inside place to sit except kitchen. No kitchen extras like salt & pepper or anything. Kitchen equipment basic Beds are fine  fairly firm. Good value.
50923824,Nick June 2022 Tonia  who is the host at the property  was incredibly warm and kind. The place is clean and tidy. The shower is a sit down shower situation  and I used the outdoor public shower more often.  If you don't hire a motorcycle or car prepare to do a lot of walking up and down steep narrow roads. (A 50cc scooter will not make it up the hill with two people). You can walk to the beach from Tonia's. It's a beautiful and popular beach  with a lot of people and can be noisey. There are quieter and just as beautiful  if not more  a short drive/ride or a decent walk..
50923824,Maren June 2022 Really friendly So close to the beach Super nice Trasse
50923824,Miriam June 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at the appartement Tonia. Pelakas Beach is a really beautiful  quiet place with a wonderful beach. The appartement is also quite nice. Particularly  the terrace has a wonderful view of the ocean. The beach is a five minute walk away. We recommend to rent a car. The owners are very kind. They only speak Greek  so communication was a but difficult at times  however  we it still worked with gestures and google translate. The windows are equipped with window screens but the kitchen rather sparsely equipped. Via Airbnb it is not possible to communicate with the hosts of the apartment. You could also book the trip directly at the homepage of the Tonia Appartment in pelekas beach. All in all we really recommend this place if you are for a quiet and relaxing vacation.
50923824,Anna September 2021 The apartment is 10 minutes walk from the beautiful beach and there is also a supermarket located 5 minutes walk. The apartment is well equipped  we did not miss there anything important. The terrace is spacious and the view is amazing. Response from Your.Rentals September 2021 Thank you so much for your kind words. We really appreciate you taking the time out to share your experience with us. We look forward to seeing you again in the future!
50923824,Adi August 2021 Well located above wonderful Pelekas beach  very clean  amenities lacks a little (make sure A/C is working and hot water cattle there). Bottom line good value for price Response from Your.Rentals August 2021 Thank you for taking the time to write your feedback. We have informed the homeowner of your review and will follow up accordingly. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention. We will try to improve our service and hope that we can have another chance to work with you in the future with our best. Show more

18354099,Victoria October 2022 We really enjoyed our stay here. The room is light and airy and has pretty much everything you need. Location is great just outside the main village square. We would come back!
18354099,Krystian August 2022 Everything was great. Communication with Vasileios (owner) was very good and the view was brilliant.
18354099,Kyrylo August 2022 Great place  everything was according to the description. All necessities provided. No a/c  but the temperature inside was comfortable even with 33° outside. The closest beach is 2km far  with elevation difference of about 150m.
18354099,Jane July 2022 Lovely little studio perfect stay with wonderful hosts who were so kind  and very helpful during our stay. Jane & Alison
18354099,Taras June 2022 We had amazing holiday. We appreciate Vasileios about his hospitality and generosity. Also we really thankful for excellent service!
18354099,Oezcan June 2022 Everything was excellent. Vassilis is a great host! Thank you a lot and hopefully see you again!
18354099,Abdullatif May 2022 Vasileios was really nice and the studio was clean. He thought about everything and always answered very quickly when we had questions. I can only recommend. Perfect Airbnb experience
18354099,Margaux May 2022 Really spacious and lovely studio  5 min walk from village center streets! The best part were the hosts. They were great with communication and so kind! We were even given a ride to the airport. Vasileios also has a lovely shop in the village where he sells his art!!! Would definitely come back here :)
18354099,Barbora August 2021 Studio in Pelekas was huge. It is just on the main road from Pelekas and some evenings and nights was disturbed by people leaving on noisy motorbikes. There is no climatization. But whole day the sun doesn't shine in the windows  so the temperature is stable and bearable. Place was really clean  beach towels were great. You find there everything you need for your vacation. Due to Covid  we haven't met Vasileios  but the communication was always fast and exact. Beach is by foot cca 30 minutes downhill. It is cca 2-3 km.
18354099,Lisa August 2021 Vasilis apartment is clean and spacious. Many useful things like beach towels  a parasol  mosquito lamps .. are provided and also additional Covid-safety measures are taken to make the guests feel safe. The apartment is located in Pelekas town. Many good restaurants can be reached within a 5 minute walking distance. Pelekas Beach and Glyfada Beach are located down the hill (30 minutes walk). The way up is quite steep  so you might consider renting a car. Vasilis is a great host. He always replied quickly to our messages  recommended a taxi driver and told us a lot about Pelekas. You should visit him in his shop in Pelekas center where he sells his beautiful handcrafted art. We had a nice stay and definitely recommend the place. Response from Vasileios August 2021 Thank you very much for so warm words! It will be pleasure to see you again!
18354099,Adrian August 2021 The studio is good located  at the end of the Pelekas village  close to the main street  so in the morning it can be a little bit noisy  starting 7 a.m. The studio is so spacious that it sounds echoed. Although we appreciated the fact that is well equipped  clean and very close to Glyfada  Mirtiotissa and Kontogialos beaches and Corfu Town also.
18354099,Matthieu August 2021 A great accommodation in a very nice town. Vasileios is very helpful. Thank you !
18354099,Bela September 2020 Spacious room and nice location. Was a nice experience and my host made sure my questions were answered quickly.

18354099,Rania August 2020 We really enjoyed our stay. Vasileios and his wife are really nice people even if we get the chance to meet only his wife Elena. The apartment is spacious and very clean close to many tavernas with nice greek food. Vasileios was always available for all our requests. Thank you. I totally recommend and we would defenetly come back there.
18354099,Petr August 2020 We had a great time in this apartment. Everything was as described. Even there's no air-condition there was comfortable temperature inside. Vassilis is easy going guy and helped us with all things we needed. Totally recommend.
18354099,Gemma November 2019 The studio is in an ideal location  surrounded by stunning views. Inside has all the amenities to provide a comfortable stay whilst in Pelekas. Vasilis and his wife Elena are superb hosts and checked on us during our stay to ensure everything was going well. We hope to return soon and have recommended the studio to friends.
18354099,Dominik September 2019 Studio was absoltelly perfect and Vassilis as well. Great location. Studio was clean  nice  there was literally everything what you need to have and some extra stuff. Vassilis went for us to the airport and also gave us a lift back. He Gave us many tips for trips and arranged to rent a scooter right in Pelekas. I can definitelly recommend this studio!
18354099,Till September 2019 The place is very spacious  with everything you need to cook etc.  and has a nice terrace outside where you can hang out. The walk down to the beach is about 25 minutes (if you don't have a vehicle)  and it's really a nice beach. Vassilis is supernice and knows a lot of storys about the town  he also picked us up at the bus station  we're very happy to have met him.
18354099,Alain Et Valerie August 2019 don't hesitate to go to Vassili home it is well located  quiet  very clean and Vasiily is a super Host thanks to his tips we have discovered Corfu in a wonderful way we recommend Response from Vasileios September 2019 Thank you for your warm words! We will be glad to see you again any time!
18354099,Giovanni August 2019 Vassilis and his wife were extremely efficients and kind to us. The location is great  not far away from the capital  such a charming small town! The apartment is very cosy  comfortable  spacious and very well full equipped. A pleasant space to stay!
18354099,Anne-Claire August 2019 We had a great time in Pelekas  the village is really cute and beautiful. Vassilis is an extraordinarily nice host  always ready to help and to give you tips about the best spots and where to go. I gladly recommand staying at Vassilis’.
18354099,Philippe August 2019 A great experience ! The studio is wonderful  quiet  spacious  with a nice view on hills around Corfou.

An address highly recommandable... Response from Vasileios August 2019 Philippe  thank you for your so warm words! It will be lovely to see you again!
18354099,Taras July 2019 Vassilis is a wonderful host! Very friendly  pick us up from a bus stop  provided quick tour through the village and was really helpful during our stay. Apartment’s location is very convenient  at the end of the village  but not that far from it’s center. About 20 min to the nearest beach by foot  although walk back up the hill could be a bit tiresome  so better to rent some vehicle. The nearest tavern is really close  but we didn’t hear any noise from it  and even though apartment is close to the road  traffic isn’t that big and wasn’t bothering. Response from Vasileios August 2019 Thank you for your warm words! It`s will be pleasure to see you again!
18354099,Sarah June 2019 The accommodation was fantastic. Ideal location for the town and a 20 min walk to the beach. It is great value and a fantastic sized apartment. Vassilis was a great host.He let us know of local festivals and events  even going as far to give us a lift there. Nearby is a great little family owned supermarket called Sophie’s which had everything we needed. We would highly Vassilis apartment. A special find.
18354099,Niclas September 2018 Vasillis was the host that everybody wants. He always responded immediatly and had a lot of great tips both for pelekas and korfu in general. He even picked us up from the bus station to bring us to our Apartment and the checkin was very flexibel. The studio itself was very clean and even bigger then i thought. The only thing i missed was w-lan but compared to Vasillis as a host and the studio itself its a little issue. I recommend this apartment to everyone that want to see the beautiful village pelekas and korfu in general.
18354099,Sandrine August 2018 We enjoyed so much our stay at Pelekas!!! Vassilis and his wife Elena were so helpful  they are always available to explain the beaches  and places to visit. They are very pleasant people! The studio is spaceful  with all that we need for a good stay! Pelekas is a charming small town. We rent a scooter to visit around Pelekas  good choice!

18354099,Maksim July 2018 Communication with Vassilis and his family  their responsiveness and friendliness  their hospitality are something absolutely outstanding! That was our best communication airbnb experience for sure. As for the studio - it’s quite spacious and it has everything you need. It’s really fresh in there  so the conditioner is not needed indeed. The window view is picturesque! Especially the sunset. As for the location  there’re 2 main beaches around the place  but they are 20-30 minutes walking away  so if you are not a fan of long-distance walking  I would advice to rent a bike or a car. So  all in all  that was an amazing stay  thank you  Vassilis for everything  nice to meet you and your family  and to spend these days at your place!
18354099,Jérémy July 2018 We had a great stay in pelekas. The studio is really nice and clean. Vassilis was a great host and gave us many local information about beaches  transports  restaurants ...

18354099,Florence September 2022 Very spacious studio and matches the photos. Vassilis is charming and very responsive  available if needed and ready to chat and give information on where to go. The only downside is that the wifi is super slow. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Rocco September 2022 very comfortable house  every comfort available  very helpful hosts...to return for sure Translated from Italian  Show original
18354099,Katrin September 2022 Very comfortable and comfortable place to stay with a nice host. The morning is busy when the windows are open  but nothing to do. Translated from Czech  Show original

Vasileios was very available and always friendly  my girlfriend and I also needed extra time for check-in and the owner was very helpful. Highly recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
18354099,Evelyne June 2022 A well functional apartment to shine by car and visit all Corfu in a lively village. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Thomas September 2021 well suited for a night if you are on the Corfu Trail  the accommodation is right on the path and it is only 5 minutes to the village center! Translated from German  Show original
18354099,Thierry September 2021 great and see you soon Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Olivier September 2021 Very functional apartment  ideally a place to travel around the island. It's very easy to park in front of the apartment  which is a real plus in Corfu ! The village has all amenities including in super sorcierge store !! Recommended Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Françoise July 2021 A little sad place  no views. Pélekas is not recommended for non-motorized guests (no buses to the beach). Too bad it's a typical village. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Aurélien September 2020 Very good for a short stay Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Julia August 2020 The studio is very large  with a high ceiling  making it very spacious and keep it cool even in August which is a real pleasure ! When we arrived  the cleaning had just been done  everything was very clean. The location is ideal for walking to the beach (note: the return is going up !) or going pretty much anywhere you want by car (not far from Corfu  or Paleokastritsa for example). The village itself is very nice  with bars and taverns  and a magnificent sunset from the throne of Kaiser at the very top of the hillside of the village. I would recommend staying here without so much as a second thought  and would stay here again ! Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Constance August 2020 A great value for money for this quiet studio  on the heights of the charming village of Pelekas. I can only recommend : the studio is large  perfectly clean and the hosts are charming and responsive! Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Suzon August 2020 We had a lovely stay in pelekas. Very well located accommodation at the end of the village towards the beaches. The studio is large  well-equipped and close to amenities. Highly recommend ! Translated from French  Show original

18354099,Damien September 2018 The apartment is conveniently located in Pelekas  Vasilis is very welcoming and attentive. It is a large studio with a small balcony and all the basic amenities. Translated from French  Show original
18354099,Izah September 2018 Perfect host and great kindness!! We had a great time talking to each other. He is a very generous person. The apartment is impeccable. We have everything we need.

Translated from French  Show original

18354099,Marine August 2017 The best trip  simply. An extraordinary welcome in a quiet but lively village  near the best beaches on the island and the best restaurants. A lot of people come back  and that's right. We'll be back  too! Translated from French  Show original Response from Vasileios August 2017 Thank you for everything! It was nice to meet you and we will be glad to see you again!
25901645,Диана August 2022 The apartment is small enough in case you want to cook it doesn't have a kitchen. Furthermore  the tableware were all dirty  after previous guests they were not washed. There is no iron in the apartment  as stated in the description. We could iron things in a nearby hotel. The hostess is a nice woman  but it takes a long time to respond to messages. Near the apartment there is a supermarket and several bars.
25901645,Steven & Denise August 2022 Central in the mountain village of Pelekas  not far from Kerkyra town. No cooking facilities in the small apartment  but good for a short stay. Water supply occasionally interrupted in the village  but this can be accommodated!
25901645,Sophia July 2022 Nice & clean place. Would totally recommend. No warm water and the toilet flush didn’t worked the first days but got fixed. Amazing Mountain View. Lovely village with nice restaurants  bars and bakerys.
25901645,Angela July 2022 Very nice small apartment in the middle of Pelekas. Host very nice.
25901645,Haris September 2021 A very basic apartment  substantially clean  good enough for a short affordable stay.
25901645,Iulia July 2021 The owner is very nice. the apartment is very beautiful and in a quiet area. There are many shops nearby and restaurants with tasty food. The beach is relatively close and beautiful. The water is very clean and the view is wonderful.
25901645,Maryna August 2019 This flat is very nice. We really enjoyed this vacation in village Pelekas.
25901645,Никита August 2019 Nice cosy flat. Very clean. One thing to improve is WiFi. Good choice for reasonable price.
25901645,Heather May 2019 We stayed for one night whilst walking the Corfu Trail. We collected the keys from the mini market in the main square. The accommodation was nearby and wonderfully unique.
25901645,Bruce March 2019 Pelekas is magical. The apartment is perfect.  just not good if you want to cook.
25901645,VAsily March 2019 Great location with amazing view from the window.
25901645,Ward September 2018 The room is small but conveniened. Airconditioning Works great. We used it while walking the Corfu trail to have a nice night of sleep. That is exactly what we have got
25901645,Ermal August 2018 It is a comfortable apartment in Pelekas (a really nice Greek town in Corfu) the only problem we have it was the water not working some days and the toilet paper that was not enough. For the rest everything ok.
25901645,Peter October 2022 It seemed difficult to receive us. It went by phone and then through the husband who didn't like much and didn't know anything. We wouldn't have to leave until 11: 00 a.m.  but at 10: 00 a.m.  the cleaning lady was at the door to get us out. although not the cheapest  it was the least of the apartments we visited in Corfu Translated from Dutch  Show original
25901645,Sandrine August 2022 Very well located in Pelekas but dark apartment  medium quality of bedding  not suitable for eating... value for money not agreed Translated from French  Show original
25901645,Luuk August 2022 Perfect small but cozy village with everything you need. In the evening also choice of several cozy terraces. Were also received very kindly. Apartment is small  but if you only use it for sleeping it is perfect. Translated from Dutch  Show original
25901645,Tobias June 2022 Super accommodation with an excellent location. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Jakub August 2021 Time is running out. The photos are misleading and don't accurately represent the space. It was dirty and scary  and we had to cancel. Zero respect for the guest  even though Agnes was sorry and explained why it's so dirty  it's still not worth the stress or the relief. Pelekas is better to come from Corfu for a day and stay here. Translated from Polish  Show original
25901645,Jennifer August 2021 Beautiful place with fantastic sunsets. The room was cozy  only if you like to cook for yourself there is no kitchen there. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Aspa August 2021 Very difficult to communicate  unfortunately we had a day out of 3 when we were staying off of water. It didn't have all the amenities she wrote (hair dryer and iron). The village of Pelekas is very beautiful and close to Κέρκυρα about 15 min by car. Translated from Greek  Show original
25901645,Garage August 2021 An inexpensive and very typical place with all the things that it implies. Nevertheless  it is well located but we will not go back. Translated from French  Show original
25901645,Nawid August 2021 Just great!!! Really for a great holiday just the right thing. A small cute village with very nice people and a very family flair. Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Franz August 2019 At the appointed time  we were unable to check in yet as the guests had not previously checked out on time. As a compensation  there was free coffee at Agnes's restaurant. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner and unfortunately it was not cleaned in between as promised. Everything else went well  there was even free Tzatziki :) Translated from German  Show original
25901645,Raffaella August 2019 Very nice apartment  convenient for check-in. Small but comfortable house  great location in a characteristic landscape!! Translated from Italian  Show original
25901645,Tiphaine September 2018 The village of Pelekas is very cute  the locals are lovely and do not hesitate to help us if needed. On the other hand  our host was not the one described when booking. The welcome was short and cold. As our stay went  the host relaxed and we discovered a nice person. The only problem was that the bathroom was not perfectly clean and that the apartment lacked accessories such as toilet paper. Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Lorna September 2022 Myself and my friend had the most wonderful stay here! Debbie and Tony were so welcoming  friendly and helpful. They have made this place so beautiful- we especially loved the view from the treehouse with a glass of Debbie’s homemade wine!! There is also a lovely spot for yoga and mats to use- we enjoyed doing this at sunrise. The beach is near but down quite a big hill so we would recommend hiring bikes or a car if you can. The town nearby  Pelekas  is also very pretty- we enjoyed cocktails in a bar called Zanzibar which was recommended to us by Tony. The Olive Grove Oasiss was a great find and I would completely recommend visiting. I can’t wait to come back soon! Thank you Debbie and Tony :)
50701568,Johannes September 2022 Debbie's place was the perfect choice for us! Each corner was build with love and you can see her own signature everywhere ;) I'd definitely recommend this place to people who want to calm down for a couple of days.
50701568,Majai September 2022 Well  where do I start.... If you are after a place that will bring comfort  joy and peace and stillness this is the place for you. If you are after an amazing  caring  open  thoughtful host that will stay with you on the phone until 2am to help you find the place even though she was at the hospital with her son this is the place for you ( getting there at night  and being left by the taxi driver at the wrong place made it confusing). Very easy to find during the day. If you want a very clean  comfortable bed and cooking and cleaning facilities this is the place. It is something you must experience to understand. Do not go there and give bad review because of the hills and silly things like that. Pelekas and Corfu in general and overall are just wonderful. Will definitely return and strongly recommend!
50701568,Max September 2022 wasn't able to stay the full length unfortunately however the short stay we had was amazing
50701568,Hussein August 2022 Staying at debbie's was an amazing experience.. she created a simple but beautiful campsite that will give you a memorable and enjoyable experience.. thank you debbie for your great hospitality :D
50701568,Julius August 2022 Debbie is a very warm hostess who is always available with advice and tips. Everything was incredibly uncomplicated. It is a beautiful place to relax.
50701568,Clara August 2022 Beautiful stay in corfu  waking up to a olive branches and the smell of summer. Even in high season the island is stunning and charming  and Debbie’s place is just great. Pelekas is small and cosy with some great places to eat (we especially enjoyed Alexandros). We didn’t rent a vehicle but instead took to hiking to the beaches of our choice which was fine for us  but corfu is hilly and getting around is not so easy so if possible rent a car or scooter:)
50701568,Milica July 2022 Debbie is a very welcoming host. She will give you lots of local tips  taste of local food and wine and make you feel like at home. Space is very nice and every detail is nicely arranged. View from the view tower is amazing. We could only use more light in the evening along the path to the tent. Beware not to follow Google instructions when trying to reach the place  it could lead you on a longer and quite a bad road.
50701568,Gabriella Holmen July 2022 We had a great time at Debbie’s. The campground was great with everything you needed  plus her and her family were really nice. The views and surroundings of the place were beautiful and non-touristy which was great - then you could always go to the more touristy parts if you wanted to. It was a bit hot to stay in a tent when you are here during a heatwave and the crickets are quite loud  when you are going to sleep  but it is nothing a couple of ear plougs can’t handle. All and all a really great (and different) stay  that we would highly recommend others to try out :-)
50701568,Luise July 2022 Debbie was the best host and the location was absolutely beautiful
50701568,Karlijn July 2022 Debbie and the whole campsite are amazing! They’re very welcoming and friendly and the place is so unique. We loved the lookout tower  the passionate way Debbie talks about the whole area and the small details the stay has. Would 10/10 recommend!
50701568,Stanislas July 2022 We recommand the place for a different kind of stay. The bed is confortable  and the coffe on a platform ion a tree is a delight :)
50701568,Filip June 2022 My boyfriend and I loved the place and the amazing hosts. Can’t thank this family enough! Unfortunately  I got sick during our short stay but Debbie and Toni did everything so I could get better. They called a doctor to check up on me  Debbie was in contact with us at all times and prepared a delicious Greek soup and baklava for us. To get that sick in a foreign country can be scary but with their help I was as good as new in 2days! Wish I could have been able to enjoy the amazing beaches nearby and the stunning views for longer! I can’t recommend this place enough!
50701568,Wilken June 2022 Debbie and her family are fantastic hosts and have a beautiful camping ground with a lot of great details. We would come back any time!
50701568,Elisabeth June 2022 Really nice persons and on complete disposal for every kind of need.
50701568,Regina June 2022 The perfect place to stay in Corfu if you are looking for some quie  nature and authentic people. Debbie  Tony and Nicholas are wonderful hosts who will provide you with all the information and recommendations you mught need and make you feel welcome and at home from the first minute.
50701568,Cassidy May 2022 This is an experience like no other!! I’ll start off by saying Debbie and Nicholas were the most incredible hosts - so kind and accommodating and gave us some amazing local recommendations! Truly wonderful people who made us feel immediately at home.  We had the most wonderful stay in this tent  and the bed is the most comfortable we have slept on anywhere in Greece so far! Having morning coffee and painting rocks with wine in the afternoon in the lookout tower was truly magical. Tucked in the trees on the side of the hill  this place is truly an oasis.  The site offers everything you could ever need  with a shower  fully stocked kitchen and even a running water toilet! The facilities are all shared with other guests but we never had any trouble with accessing anything. (Just remember to label your food / drinks  we had bought a nice bottle of bubbles that one of the other guests enjoyed while we were in town!)  We had a car and the site has a a good size parking space. Also the town of Pelekas was amazing! It’s a smaller less touristic town with many restaurants and the food we had here was fantastic.  I can’t recommend this stay enough  it is a true gem and the hosts are the most wonderful people. I would stay again in a heart beat if I make it back to Corfu in the future! Show more
50701568,Bianca September 2021 It’s the best stay you can have! Debbie is such a wonderful welcoming host creating a magical vibe at this place. No matter what she‘s there for you and tries to help you out. She even brings home cooked food every day. The area is in the middle of the nature with a breathtaking view. We felt so connected and rooted  enjoyed the tent feeling with the bed inside to the fullest. Highly recommended :)
50701568,Malika September 2021 The place is full of kindness  just like the hosts. Beautiful nature to enjoy and the close village (Pelekas) is also very beautiful. The closest beaches are nice too. So we can only fully recommend! Thank you Debbie and Tony :)
50701568,Daniel August 2021 Absolutely fantastic experience  cannot recommend any stronger. Debbie is a great host who really cares about your stay and makes sure everything goes smoothly. The campsite has wonderful views and is only 20 mins walk/5 min drive from the nearest beach. Kitchen/toilets are fully equipped. We were also concerned about the heat at night but the shady location and open tent made for a very pleasant temperature. Thank you Debbie!!!
50701568,Reindert August 2021 Debbie is a most kind  lovely and helpful host! The campsite is beautiful and everything you could wish for is provided.
50701568,"Guilhem August 2021 Debbie is a lovely host and the ""Glamping"" experience was wonderful! Relaxing setting  great view for the lookout  close (could not be closer) to nature. Communication ran more than smoothly. I would definitely recommend!"
50701568,Nikolina August 2021 The Debbie's place is a little diamond for all of those who look for a peaceful and restful holiday. The camping site is a perfect example of how a sustainable tourism should look like - small scale  renewable energy and environmentally friendly facilities. Apart from that  Debbie and her family are absolutely amazing hosts  super caring and ready to help anytime. The camping site has an adorable and unique coastal view and summer nights are refreshing so you can have a plenty of good sleep outdoors. I particularly liked the story behind the camping site which Debbie likes to share with its guests and all the little details around it which prove the site had been made with a lot of love and commitment. I would strongly recommend this place to everyone looking for such a holiday.  10/10
50701568,Matthieu September 2022 Great stay at Deddie's  who welcomed us with open arms! The place is very beautiful and relaxing. Deddie takes the time to show us the must-see spots of the island  she was very kind. She really has her hand on her heart. Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Ayse-Nur August 2022 Debbie is a wonderful host. The campsite is breathtaking  the view from the platform and the tree house is simply not to be found on Corfu. Of course  this also has its price: you have to walk up and down a lot to get to the beach  for example. Good leg training :) Pelekas is also not far away on foot and a super cute little village. I highly recommend the place! Translated from German  Show original
50701568,Linus August 2022 We enjoyed very much at Debbie's place and will definitely come back sometime. The camp has always been nicely tidy and is well equipped with everything you need and more. Debbie and her family were there for us at any time of the day if we needed anything and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Translated from German  Show original
50701568,Maarten August 2022 We enjoyed the place and the loving welcome of Debbie. All facilities are provided. With also nice extras such as games  food  drinks and so on. Translated from Dutch  Show original
50701568,Lisa August 2022 An exceptional setting and a very attentive host wishing us to have an unforgettable stay! Translated from French  Show original
50701568,Ananda September 2021 Excellent!! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Michel November 2022 One week stay. End of october. Very quiet. Empty beach. Beautyfull view from the balcony . Welcoming hosts. At this time of the year you need a car to fill up the refrigerator . No shop or restaurant around. We found the kitchen corner small and poorly equipped (no oven or salad bowl). That’s a pity because everything beside was perfect .
49460672,Taelor October 2022 If you’re wanting to go to Greece and looking for a place that is affordable  clean  waterside  with an amazing host  and a view that is so perfect it looks fake  look no further. This Airbnb was perfect for my boyfriend and I. Maria was there for any and every question we had. If we ever come back to Corfu  I know exactly where I will be staying.
49460672,Sara September 2022 Comfortable apartment which caters for all needs. Amazing views from balcony. Lovely hosts who were very helpful
49460672,Anastasia September 2022 We'd a very nice stay at the apartement.
49460672,Imogen August 2022 We had an amazing stay. The apartment was very clean and tidy and had everything we needed. Maria was great with communication and went above and beyond to help us out when we couldn’t get a taxi! Thank you!
49460672,Jenna July 2022 María was such a welcoming host. Very helpful with suggestions for the island. The flat was perfect- we swam each morning on a deserted beach. It was busy during the days of course  but centrally located to explore the west coast and a quick drive to Corfu. And that hammock seat was a perfect place to watch the sunset!
49460672,Hannah June 2022 Maria was incredible helpful offering us advice and being incredibly accommodating. The flat has amazing views. A car is a must to explore the island.
49460672,Stuart June 2022 We had a lovely  relaxing time in this apartment. The view from the swing chair on the balcony was perfect. Maria was the perfect host - really helpful. Beautiful beach and easy bus access to Corfu Old Town. Thoroughly recommended.
49460672,Lauren June 2022 Excellent location with a beautiful view. The apartment was just the right size and utility for my dad and I. We'd love to come back
49460672,Pako May 2022 Friendly host  cosy appartement  great view and great location. i definitely recommend!
49460672,Micky May 2022 The apartment fullt exceeded our expectations! It was very clean and the balcony had an amazing view. Μαρία is a great hostess and she prepared a list of recommendations for restaurants  beaches and places to visit.
49460672,Hayley April 2022 Maria’s place is central to the island which makes it perfect for exploring  with a welcoming beach to relax on in the afternoons  or the balcony on an evening. The accommodation is as described with the benefit of private parking in a gated community which gives peace of mind if you have a rental car. We’d come back for sure  but a little later in the year as most places are still closed. Maria will point you to some great places if you need some inspiration for things to do and places to eat. We’ll miss the swinging chair and views !
49460672,Florian April 2022 All you need for Corfu: a wonderful beach and nice house right next with two great hosts.
49460672,Vanessa March 2022 Maria and her partner were lovely hosts. I was a solo traveller and they were always available to contact via airbnb or WhatsApp. They even offered to take me to the next town to do a food shop as I wasn’t hiring a car! The apartment was clean and had everything I needed. Beautiful view and lovely beach to have walks and chill. I would definitely recommend! I will be booking again for sure! Great find.
49460672,Ariles November 2021 Nice appartement with a superb view! However  Bedding should be changed for a better comfort. Good location to move all around the island. Maria was very kind. She gave us all the good tips and is available at all time.
49460672,Daryl October 2021 This place was a perfect base to explore the island from. Maria gave us lots of recommendations on where to visit. Car hire recommended.  Apartment ticks all the boxes and the balcony is so good to have breakfast and also watch the sunset!  Glyfada is nice little town/resort with a super beach  the sand is like brown sugar!
49460672,Valerie October 2021 Small but really nice apartment with a beautiful view!
49460672,Alex October 2021 I can’t say enough good things about this Airbnb - Maria and Stavros went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience and got to see some other parts of this area of Corfu. The view is stunning - book for this alone! - and it’s a 5 min walk down to a gorgeous beach. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again ☺️
49460672,Jonathan October 2021 great apartment and location  ideal for the beach. Maria and Stavros are great hosts
49460672,Isaac September 2021 Maria's place is fantastic and everything we wanted for our weekend in Corfu! The view is stunning looking out over the beach. It's only a short walk down to the beach (which we did every morning). We were looking to explore Corfu and as the apartment is centrally located on the island it's a great spot. The bed is comfortable  the wifi is fast (if you need to work) and the place is stylishly decorated. Can't wait to come back next year :)
49460672,Marina September 2021 Maria’s apartment is small but cute. Enough for two people but wouldn’t recommend more. It has a small balcony with a little hammock. Directly view on the ocean  which is of course beautiful. You have the beach right in front of you.  I must admit though   that we preferred other beaches  which were 30/40 min away (other side of the island)  so you definitely need a car to get there. There are restaurants down there  there are closing early in the eves though  so if u wanna go for dinner   I would recommend to go early or drive somewhere.  The bathroom is very small and the shower has not much power. But Some might not bother.  Maria is great in communication. She always answered directly and helped us directly. (Advised as well as fixing a broken toilet seat)! Thank you for that.
49460672,Ryan September 2021 Stunning views  very helpful host! Stay if you want some peace and quiet with a balcony that never gets boring!
49460672,Dariusz July 2021 Apartment with everything you need  clean and cozy. Great view and close to the beach. I fully recommend it.
49460672,Sebastian June 2021 awesome view and steep but short walk to a perfect beach  had a great time and would have loved to spend more nights there. Also very pleasant hosts
49460672,Michael June 2021 Host: 5* - very helpful  very good recommendations for trips  late check out Apartment: 5* - it is as beautiful as it is shown on the pics  sleeping with the sound of the ocean - awesome! Location: 5* - very quiet location  only sound of the ocean :) rental car is still recommended
49460672,Sascha October 2022 Beautiful little apartment on surely one of the most beautiful beaches in Corfu. From the terrace you have a wonderful view of this. The apartment was very clean. The hosts very friendly. Gladly come back. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Malin September 2022 The stay in Glyfada in Maria and Stravos' apartment was very wonderful. The view from Balcony is indescribable. Maria and Stavros are warm-hearted hosts and always on hand if we needed any questions or help. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Geoffrey September 2022 Great sea view  excellent terrace. 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Antonio August 2022 The apartment has a very panoramic location. The balcony is equipped with comfortable chairs  a table for lunch and also a very comfortable hanging chair to enjoy complete relaxation. Glyfada Beach is a couple of minutes' walk Translated from Italian  Show original
49460672,Sylvie July 2022 A breathtaking view  a very well located and beautifully decorated home. We were very happy with the welcome  the owners are very kind and attentive. I really recommend this place for a quiet holiday. Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Chiara July 2022 Thank you for the great stay! Everything was perfect! Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Lisette July 2022 An idyllic place with a beautiful balcony overlooking the sea! Be careful however for those who would have trouble walking you have to go down five minutes of stairs before arriving at the beach... A perfect welcome and very wise advice from Our Hosts! Thank you 🤩 Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Sophie May 2022 Very nice  uncomplicated and helpful - got great tips for the area and also felt very comfortable in the apartment and on the balcony! :) Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Sylvain May 2022 Great place to visit this beautiful island. This place is really good. Thank you to our host for all their advice and kindness. Hope to have the opportunity to come back Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Richard November 2021 We had the perfect time. The apartment is even more beautiful than in the photos (and it's already fantastic there). The host is very friendly and gave us lots of good tips on what to do. All in all we would recommend it to anyone. If possible  travel by car  which simplifies a lot. You can also explore this beautiful island and see many great places.  We were there now in November  which is something next to the season and means a lot is closed. Nevertheless  it is worth the trip and the experience. Small shops are open and you can cook in the apartment  which means that you can enjoy a delicious dinner with direct sea views. Translated from German  Show original
49460672,Victor August 2021 A comfortable studio with a dedicated parking space  a great view of the horizon. Direct access to the family beach of Glyfada  very lively during the day  and very quiet in the evening. The real plus of the studio is its terrace  quiet and not overlooked. Quite ideal location on the island as you will find the charm of the beaches to the west  while being close to the liveliness of Corfu  perfect for a night out in town. Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Annelise August 2021 Maria is very attentive  available  trusted and accommodating ! The apartment has exceptional views  it matches the photos. Thank you Maria for hosting us ! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Salima June 2021 The place to be ! We spent 5 nights at Maria's. The apartment is very good with an amazing view and so relaxing. Very well equipped. If you want to move a little  transportation is essential. We opted for a quad which we managed to see with the help of Maria. She connected us with a guy who brought us the quad there. Maria was very available and responsive and we thank her very much. We would recommend this place if you are looking for tranquility. Also one last note the Glyfada page is just beautiful  for us one of the most beautiful in Corfu ! Thanks again Maria ! Translated from French  Show original
49460672,Vivien June 2021 Nice and cozy apartment with a beautiful view of Glyfada Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Alex September 2022 Fantastic stay at Stavros's Studio. Everything about our stay there was great. Stavros is a super friendly person and a great host who went the extra mile for us  picking us up from the airport  helping us find a car to rent and offering us valuable information to help us make the best of our stay. The Studio is located in a good tranquil position close to Mertiotissa beach (10 min walk) and Glyfada beach (35-40 min walk)  also close to Linda's Mini market where you can buy things you need. The studio is clean  equiped with all you need and having a lovely terrace surrounded by nature. Thank you very much Stavros for the hospitality and the great stay and the great holiday we had. kind regards Alex & Maria
3838303,Katharina June 2022 You need to go to this Airbnb! It was absolutely amazing - very clean and spacious and exactly as you see in the pictures. The area is stunning and so beautiful and you have the Mirtiotissa beach just around the corner or you can take the bus to the other beaches as well as to Corfu City. There's also a mini-market very close by and some restaurants and no matter where we went  everyone was super friendly and welcoming towards me and my friend. We stayed for a week and we loved every minute. Stavros is also such a great and caring host. He was able to pick us up from the Airport when we arrived and he was always available when we had some questions. He always made sure we felt comfortable and had everything we need and we also enjoyed our occasional conversations with him. He is really a great person and we are very happy that we have met him and we will definitely come back! Thank you again for everything!
3838303,Elisa June 2022 The studio offers anything you need to feel like in paradise.
3838303,Mona-Marie June 2022 The studio is located at  we think  the most beautiful spot on the island. You can reach two beautiful beaches (Myrtiotissa and Glyfada) by foot. Also there is a bus stop and a mini market only 10 min walk away. Stavros is a very kind and welcoming person and he gave us a couple of good tips where to go on Corfu. He also managed to get us scooters! Overall we can only recommend this appartment and we will definitely go there again when we are on Corfu 🌞
3838303,"Mario May 2022 To be honest I am speechless (in the best possible way)! It was exactly what I was searching for and Stavros is a super sweet host. He even bought some groceries for me because my flight had a delay - amazing! Fun fact  his mom lives in my hometown in Germany  it is truly a small world!  The studio is really clean and it is a perfect place to calm down and relax. Around 800m away you find ""Paralia Mirtiotissa"". It is a beautiful clean beach and reachable within a 10-15 walk. I had it all to myself when I went there around 09:30/10:00 in the morning.  Dont miss to eat at ""Spiros Taverna 97"". They serve traditional greek food and the roof terrace is pure gold! It is run by Maria and her brother and they are just lovely.  Another place around the corner is ""Lindas Mini Market"". Here you find everything from a toothbrush to fresh cold beers. Friendly and funny owners who are easy going.  Needless to say that Stavros studios are THE place to go when you are searching for a little paradise far away from the hectic city. This Airbnb was exactly as described except for one thing: I was welcomed by a brand new kitchen;)  P.S. never saw so many fireflies in my whole life. Show more"
3838303,Marco October 2021 The studio is located in the natur outside the small village. Really calm and great for relaxing. You can reach two beaches by foot in about 10-15 Minuten. Everything you need (Minimarket  Busstop to Corfu town and other places  cute cats and dogs  Natur to walk and hike  some restaurants …) is Good to reach by foot.  We stayed ten days at the end of october and still had some sunny days at the sea.  Stavros  the Host  is great and was easy to contact if we had any questions or needs.  Everything we needed for a nice holiday. :)
3838303,"Nicolas October 2021 Holidays in Stavros' Studio in Mirtiotissa mean: holidays in Paradise. The cosy appartments are located in one of Corfú's most beautiful parts  surrounded by peace  calm and abundant  intact nature. Within 15-20 mins. walking distance you reach the magic beach of Mirtiotissa  enjoying the most spectacular vistas onto the Mediterranean on your way. Stavros  the host  is a warmhearted Corfiot man with a great and unique sense of hospitality: he will do anything in order to make you feel at ease and comfortable as a guest in his studios. The appartments are fully furnished and equipped with everything possibly needed during your stay. And Stavros has a really subtle eye for what you might need  so don't be surprised if you find your fridge already filled with groceries at your arrival! Don't even be surprised  if the host is expecting you at the airport at your arrival! The appartments are kept perfectly clean by their owner (actually much more accurate than many hotels I've seen). Each appartment is separated from the other one in order to guarantee privacy. Both are provided with a little  patio-like covered veranda  which - with some candlelight - will turn your evenings into unforgettable romantic moments in the peace of nature. The next mini market  called ""Linda's Mini Market""  is located wtihin about 15 minutes' walking distance. You will find everything for your everydays' needs: they offer a wide choice of very good local and Greek wines  fruit juices  excellent local products such as Feta  Olives etc. And they will always try their best to help  if you have special questions. For those who prefer to enjoy the Greek cuisine in restaurants  there are three recommendable taverns within walking distance: ""Elía Tavern""  half way on the street to Mirtiotissa Beach  ""Bella Vista""  a little bit behind and above the Beach (perfect for spectacular sunsets!) and - to the other side of Stavros' Studio  in the little village of Kellia  just up the street  behind ""Linda's Mini Market"" - Spiros' Tavern 97  a picturesque and very friendly place. If you don't have a car or motorbike  no problem: the KTEL Green Bus line B 17 will take you to Corfú City within 30 mins. The bus stop is just about a 10 mins. walk away from the appartments. Now  that I write this down  my inner eye recalls the magic time I have spent in Mirtiotissa. I found Stavros' Studio by sheer (AND HAPPY!) coincidence in the net. Stavros' philosophy and phenomenal sense of hospitality are the best answer AGAINST all the blockheaded and silly all-inclusive-packages for mass tourism and THE reason  why individual holidays in Greece and other European countries are SO rewarding! Stavro  evcharistó para polí for all these unexpected magic moments - I will be back to Mirtiotissa. Nico Show more"
3838303,Nils October 2021 Stavros Studio is a very cozy and quiet place beautifully situated between the olive tree hills. If you want to avoid big hotels and party crowds  this is your choice!

Stavros is a very kind and funny guy  he picked us up from the airport and brought us back for departure and was all in all very helpful.
3838303,Andrea August 2021 Amazing! The house is a little refuge in the nature  in a quiet and peaceful part of the island.

3838303,Yelyzaveta July 2021 It was a great week with the best memories. This place will fall in love with itself from the first day  clean  quiet  comfortable. Very secluded and just a 10 minutes walk to the most intimate  picturesque beach. Many thanks to Stavros  for communication and recommendations
3838303,Robert June 2021 This cozy venue exceeded my expectations! It’s within walking distance of Mirtiotissa Beach as well as Glyfada Beach (especially if you find the short-cut behind Elia’s Taverna). It’s also within walking distance of a small grocery store and two good restaurants. If you rent a car  the location is centrally located within an hour of most Corfu tourist sites. Of course  the best part of this Airbnb is it’s owner Stavros. He’s super available  friendly  eager to please and stocks the fridge with a great start of groceries  that is especially helpful if you arrive late. And the Wi-Fi is strong! I’ve never had a better Airbnb experience.

The next grocery Shop is 2 Minutes away by car and you can find there tasty local Feta  and pasta  Rice all you can find in a village shop  even a small bar which offers fresh drinks. We rented a scooter and we moved around so easily with it. Ask Stavros about rentals. He will connect you with the local rental Company  which again are the nicest People you can expect. I cannot give this place enough Stars to Show What it can offer. I am So Glad we found it. Show more
3838303,Christina October 2020 Stavros is a great host and the location is great if you prefer nature and quiet.
3838303,Eva October 2020 Lovely place surrounded by nature with beautiful views. The garden is large and very secluded. The place has exactly what you need for a relaxing holiday! Stavros is very friendly and helpful. Many thanks!
3838303,June September 2020 A lovely secluded studio  off the beaten track  surrounded by olive groves  within reach of quiet beaches. Something very special.
3838303,Tim September 2020 The best airbnb I have ever stayed at all made perfect by the wonderful host Stavros. From picking me up at the airport for a very fair petrol cost through to the attention to detail in the apartment. For the price it is outstanding value. Big bed  hot shower  small terrace and lots of little touches. The best is the provision of some food and drink to get you started. If you are active you can get to four or five beautiful beaches on foot with two being very close. Secure parking if you have a car. Also close buy is a local shop and a coupe of great tavernas. All I can say is if you are coming to Corfu you must let Stavros look after you.
3838303,Veronika August 2020 Everything was perfect  starting with the location and private parking place and ending with the thoughtfulness of the house. We had everything we needed for life. Stavros is the most hospitable host  he even bought us some food: eggs  cheese  ham  bread  beer  butter.. Stavros has also left us a map with marks of some interesting places to visit + he gave us some tips about parking near the beaches. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely will come again!
3838303,Tom July 2020 Great little apartment at a perfect (quiet) location between a small village and Mirtiotissa beach. Stavros is a fantastic host. Perfect communication and great hospitality. Fridge was already filled up with basic foodstuff when we arrived. Really made us feel at home. Highly recommended! Thanks again Stavros.  Maxime and Tom
3838303,Tibor July 2020 It is an awesome place to stay  and it is really in the nature. :) Glyfada Beach is 10-15 minutes walk in a small trail. The other nearest beach is Mirtiotissas Beach and easily the most beautiful beach we've ever seen. Stavros gave us all the details we needed  helped with all our questions and also recommended the best restaurants. :)
3838303,Julian July 2020 A perfect place in the nature near Mirtiotissa and glyfada beach. The studio was clean and furnished with all the things you may need. Stravos is an exception host!
3838303,Verena October 2019 This was my first booking with airbnb and I am more than happy that I've chosen Stavros as a host and the lovely studio in nature. It is a really quite place near Mirtiotissa Beach. To explore the island itself I highly recommend to rent a car for the time.
3838303,June October 2019 A quiet and relaxing haven in a lovely part of Corfu. The accommodation is spacious and comfortable  and the large terrace is a real plus for enjoying sun and shade during the day  and the stars at night. Stavros  the host  could not be more helpful. We highly recommend!
3838303,Jonas September 2019 We had a very enjoyable stay at Stavros' studio. Everything was as described  the nature and the beaches were wonderful. Stavros is a warm and open person and gave us some nice tips regarding restaurants or other trips.
3838303,Tre September 2019 This was our second visit to Corfu  and both times we have stayed at Stavros's studio in nature! The atmosphere is so relaxing and not too far for going north or south f the island within maybe 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes by car if traffic is decent. The studios are close to a minimarket which is a 10-minute walk or 2-3 minture drive and if you are driving you can take the trail or roads paths to get there. There are 3 beaches local to the studio  Pelekas beach  Glyfada Beach & Miritossa Beach which is a partly/mostly nude beach but there are areas near it by the roadside you can go to if that is not your thing. The Bus line is very close if you do not rent a car (by linda's minimarket).  Stavros as always is very friendly and does whatever he can to make the stay enjoyable!
3838303,Sylvain August 2019 Stavros is so friendly  he gave us a so warm welcome in his house ! A super host ! The house is well-equipped and so well located  close to Mirtiotissa beach (15' by foot) and to the airport (30 mn by car)  in a quiet and wonderful landscape. Stavros gave us many recommandations about the beaches  restaurants... We have had wonderful holidays in Corfu ! I strongly recommend Stavros and his house.
3838303,Rachael July 2019 The photos don’t do it justice! This is the perfect accommodation if you’re looking to avoid busy tourist areas. Stavros was a thoughtful and generous host  the local amenities were awesome and the studio itself was very clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend!
3838303,Daniel July 2019 Thanks again for everything Stavros. We have spent an amazing time at your place! :)
3838303,Norbert June 2019 Stavros is a friendly good landlord who looks after the well-being of his tenants. The studio is beautifully situated in the nature and has a perfect walking distance to the beach and the mini market. We felt very comfortable there and can only recommend the studio and the landlord.
3838303,Jeannie June 2019 This studio is way out in the country side away from towns and even from villages. It is very near to a village  but is down the lane that leads to Myrtiotossa beach  and there are just the 2 studios that belong to Stavros. You are near the top of a mountain surrounded by olive trees and greenery. The stars at night are very beautiful  and the bird song is amazing. We also saw fireflies there. The studio is perfectly adequate for a comfortable stay. A double bed  a single bed  and 2 sofas; a bathroom with a shower  and a small kitchen area with fridge  cooker and sink. Stavros has supplied all kitchen equipment  towels for everyone  and he even had bought some food for us that was in the fridge - cheese  ham  tomatoes  milk etc. This is a lovely place to stay if you want to get away from people! It is in a great location and it is easy to get down to the beach  and also near to small towns and other lovely beaches. I highly recommend staying at Stavros's studio. He is a great host  easy to contact  good communication and very responsive. Show more
3838303,Salomé May 2019 A very cute house located in the nature  close to the very beautiful beaches of Mirtiotissa and Glyfadas. Stavros was very welcoming and picked us in Paleokastritas and recommended us very beautiful walks around (there are several easy trails next to his house  to a monastery on the top of the little mountain). Plus  the house was very well equipped  and Stavros even bought welcoming dishes for our arrival... Definititely recommended  thanks again Stavros!
3838303,Jonny May 2019 Stavros gave us a warm personal welcome and made sure we had everything we needed  having already provided some wine  bread  cheese and meat for our arrival. His place is spotlessly clean  well equipped and quiet. It’s perfectly located in walking distance to the gorgeous beach of Mirtiotissa and the lovely Elia Taverna. We will remember fondly sleeping in the hammock on the terrace and hope to come back soon. Great value  a friendly and caring host and a lovely place to stay. What more could one ask for?
3838303,Patrick May 2019 we loved our stay at stavros place. he was very helpful and welcoming. very quiet place  no one around  lovely beach nearby. we appreciated to have some food in the fridge for us on arrival as it was Easter Sunday and most restaurants were closed. If we return to Corfu we will definitely go back to stavros.
3838303,Drew April 2019 Stavros is a great host! He was very kind and even made time to give me a ride to the next town after i checked out. I definetly recommend staying with him.
3838303,Liam April 2019 Stavros’s studio was really lovely. It is in a perfect location if you like to avoid the busy tourist hotspots. As we went in the off-season there weren’t many restaurants open within walking distance  however we hired a moped and that was perfect to take us to the nearby beaches and villages. The area is very steep  but very beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
3838303,Wiola October 2018 great host! highy recommended!
3838303,Tre September 2018 Stavros  was a great host. He gave us tips on things to do around the island and was atentive to our every need! There is a supermarket close by as well as a couple of tavernas and a green bus stop  he helped arrange a car rental for us and it was dropped of and picked up from the studio as well as having stavros pick us up and drop us off to the airport! I would stay again when coming back to Corfu. Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Andy September 2018 Met more than our expectations such good value for money!
3838303,Karen August 2018 Perfect idyll away from the hustle and bustle of tourist areas. A short walk to beautiful swimming and snorkelling  the lovely monastery  and a short cut through the olive trees to the mini-market. You can walk to the C13 chapel at the top of the mountain with views right across Corfu - then come back to your own peaceful space to relax. We loved every minute  and Stavros was incredibly helpful and responsive. Highly recommended !
3838303,Kristina August 2018 Stavros ist the most wonderful host you could ever imagine. He is friendly and lovely. Picked us up from the airport  filled the fridge with food  organized a scooter  helped us with everything  brought us clean towels... it was the best holidays I ever had!
3838303,Jude July 2018 Stay here for a very relaxed and to gain a very 'local' experience. The smaller beach is within walkin distance as is a local mini market  taverna  bus top and restaurant. We didn't want to go travelling too far so made the most of the local amenities and enjoyed a very relaxed  calm and typical Greek lifestyle. Come and enjoy Stavros' hospitality...
3838303,Michael July 2018 Stavros is a great host. He is very helpful. The Studio is located very close to Mirtiotissa Beach. Bus stop to Corfu City is close by. Nice and quiet location. I recommand staying in Stavros' studio.
3838303,Lauretta June 2018 Stavros' studio was in a fantastic location; perfect for a rural escape. The village was friendly and useful  the beaches nearby were great  especially Glyfada. Lots of hills  but we didnt bring a car and the location was still managable. The bus service was predictable and easy to navigate  although following the timetable and looking at routes in advance would be advised. Stavros picked us up from the airport and gave us great advice about the area. All in all a wonderful stay. Highly recommend. :)
3838303,Trishy May 2018 It was on a quiet country road just near a few beaches. Lovely tranquil atmosphere and an area outside where you could sit and relax and enjoy your morning coffee. Stavros supplied a lovely selection of fridge essentials   a well equipped self catering kitchen and a few cheeky beers . ;). Just felt like you were surrounded by nature . Also very safe with secure gates to lock when you head out and come in. There are neighbours next door but we never heard a peek out of them . Was very peaceful and a perfect stay  with a perfect host who just made sure you were ok and popped back if necessary . Thanks again Stavros . We know where to come if we return to Greece . Trish and Lee :)
3838303,Renee May 2018 Beautiful location  quit and amazing surroundings. Loved the hammock outside for daytime naps. Stavros was outstanding in his hospitality and had some lunch on arrival. Quick reply on questions as well. Near the beach. Great price for the house you get in return. We would love to come back here.
3838303,Roo May 2018 What a lovely  relaxing location! The perfect base for walking in the hills and to nearby picturesque hillside villages  or relaxing and enjoying the Corfu countryside. The studio is in a beautiful little green valley  10 minutes walk from the sea. The nearest beach  Mirtiotissa  is under a dramatic cliff  with rocks to clamber on (the larger part behind the rocks is nudist  but at the far end  nearer the track  swimsuits are fine!). A lovely little monastery with peacocks in the garden is up the track from the beach  and a rambling walk further takes you to an abandoned village  and on up to a chapel on the hill. Beautiful views of Corfu. A longer  sandier beach  Glifada  is also 10 minutes walk away down a footpath through the trees. The local village shop is 10 minutes up the road  with a lovely little restaurant  Spiros97  bit further into Vatos village. There is also a restaurant  Ellia  on the way down to Mirtiotissa beach. There are buses into Corfu city. The studio itself is well equiped with all essentials  a lovely little home with a spacious terrace. Stavros himself is most welcoming  helpful and friendly! A delightful host!! :-) I highly recommend this place for a relaxing  roaming and rambling  rural retreat!!!
3838303,Alex May 2018 If you're even thinking about staying in Corfu  stop looking for other places  and stay here. First of all  Stavros is an incredible host-- he makes you feel very at home and welcome in Corfu  and stocks the house with food and drinks for you to get started before you do some shopping of your own. He recommends some incredible things to see and do  and without his recommendations  our trip wouldn't have been half as memorable. He was always available whenever we needed him (and we didn't  but he made sure to communicate well with us and tell us that we could contact him if we needed anything  from advice to fresh towels to anything else). Located not far from two great beaches  this place is surrounded by relaxing nature and isolated from the noise and business of the city.  Also  if you stay here  visit Linda's Mini-market as often as you can. Linda is amazing  and so is her husband. They're used to tourists  and they have amazing food and easy groceries if you need to do some shopping. We were there twice a day just to buy fresh pastries  hang out  and drink.
3838303,Emily April 2018 The place is super clean and the host is really quick at responding. I would suggest to rent a car/scooter because everything is hard to get to by foot. Other than that the place was super comfy and beautiful. Would definitely recommend.
3838303,Sergei April 2018 This is an amazing studio flat in a great location with an amazing host!  Flat:  The flat is clean and tidy with everything you need. It has a nice little area outside where you can relax in the sun! Stavros even provided some food and beer so it really felt like home straight away!  Location:  Turned out to be a better location that I expected. You can get to Mirtiotissa beach in 10 minute walk but I preferred Glyfada beach which again is only 10 minutes! You can also jump on the Corfu Trail walking route. A nice 1 hour walk take you to Ermones and the beach there. Nice little mini market down the road and a restaurant near by (closed because I went in April). You can also grab a bus into Crofu Town from the end of the road.  Stavros:  Stavros was great. One of the best air b n b hosts I've had. He had some spare time so picked me up and dropped me off at the airport. Was friendly before and during the stay. Provided some wine  beer and food which was super nice!  Can't recommend this place enough for a chilled getaway.  Thank! Show more
3838303,Lena April 2018 Absolutely amazing host and place to stay. My first ever booking on here and such a great start! From the minute we have booked Stavros was very helpful and welcoming. Apartment is easy to get to and its an amazing place. We rented a car and were able to travel a bit and concluded in the end that we were blessed to have been able to stay in this exact place! The air is so fresh you want to sleep for 12 hours  amenities are so great that you dont need anything else. If anything wrong Stavros is always there to help and guide and suggest. Apartment is just exactly as described and so clean! Also small touches like food for breakfast and bottle of wine was a pleasant surprise! Stavros went an extra mile to make our holiday even more pleasant. 100000% recommend! Such a great place to recharge and enjoy.
3838303,Maciej April 2018 Me and my girlfriend stayed at Stavros studio for a week. Place was very clean and well prepared for our arrival. Also we got some food extras to survive first day. Stavros is very friendly  easygoing and helpful person. He gave us some tips and recommended places to visit. When some of my friends will go to corfu island I will definitely tell them to stay at Stavros place!
3838303,Olly April 2018 Stavros and his place are a great way to see Corfu. The place is in a very quiet area  and is handy to busses to Corfu town  although services on Saturdays and Sundays are reduced. Stavros was a kind and helpful host and provided us with everything we could ever need  including food (and beer) in the fridge  picking us up and dropping us off at the ferry  and even coming around to help when we were struggling to work the stove.
3838303,Liz April 2018 A beautiful place to stay! My friend and I arrived close to 1:00am and Stavros was there waiting for us. He gave us some local places to visit and even stocked the fridge with some essentials. We were close to many of the sights but renting a car is recommended! Hope to go back to Corfu again  thank you Stavros! :)
3838303,Jiří October 2017 Our staying ať Stavros studio was realy great  everything well prepared and equipted. What´s more  Stavros picked up us at the airport and took us back as well. When we arrived to the studio there were fridge full of food and beer and water. That was surprising! Stavros is a kind  easy going and very helpfull guy. He also arranged another accomodation for us. So thank you very much for everything and we recommend this nice and quiet place to everyone. By the way  Mirtiottisa beach is the best!only 15min walking. And minimarket and restaurants are very closed as well. Good luck  Stavros!
3838303,Andy September 2017 It was situated in a quiet rural village! Very relaxing! Stavros had thought of everything including picking us from the airport on his day off! The studio is very clean! Lovely shower room with a good shower! There is a lot of walking including the walk to the beach which is hard work but we got better as the week went on! A pretty shortcut through the olive grove to Linda's mini market! She sold nearly everything! Had a very pleasant evening there too lol!! It is very chilled here and we can't wait to return! Thank you Stavros! Andy and Mandy X
3838303,Nacho August 2017 The generosity and hospitality of Stavros is completely unmatched. I could only say good things about the experience of staying at the studio  and in having Stavros as our host. Not only did he come pick us up from the airport and drop us off there on our last day  but in arriving at the studio we found a wonderfully clean and cool  air-conditioned studio with a fridge full of food and water as well as all appliances you could ever need on a holiday. The house itself is only a 10 minute walk from one of the nicest beaches on Corfu. There is also a mini market where you can buy everything you may need  as well as a bus stop nearby where you can get a 45-minute bus to Corfu-city. Overall  the studio offers a beautiful  simple yet well equipped  quiet place to enjoy a wonderful holiday. Something which is only made better by Stavros' generosity and helpfulness.  Thank you Stavros for helping make our holiday an amazing one!
3838303,Maria August 2017 This place has to be seen to be believed. Right out in nature yet a walk to beaches and bus stops. Charming small local shop with owners so helpful and obliging. Friendly locals  peace and quiet. Excellent and reliable bus service to town  shopping  sightseeing and amazing restuarants. Stavros really is the perfect host  kind  caring and available to help in any situation  goes out of his way to make sure you get what you want !! Terrific stay.
3838303,Marie July 2017 Brilliant week at Stavros's place. Perfect location in the cool trees. Perfect host  helped us with everything we needed. We also hired a car via his friend Lina at Mega Rent a car ...... that couldn't have been easier! All in all a brilliant week on the beautiful island of Corfu with our little girl.
3838303,Mark July 2017 Fantastic accommodation set into a quiet part of Mirtiotissa  10 minutes walk from the beach. There was constant hot water and air conditioning if required. The place was exceptionally clean and Stavros ensured we regularly had clean towels and linen. When we arrived the fridge was stocked with essentials  some food  water and beer. The apartments are also very secure with fence and gates.  What I loved about Stavros throughout our stay and in the months before we came is that he always responds well to messages. He is a courteous and generous man  a bit of a joker too  but I admire him and what he has achieved. He found the balance between making himself available to us if needed and giving us plenty of space so that we could just holiday in peace and privacy.  I highly recommend these apartments if you are planning to stay in Mirtiotissa or even if you are coming to Corfu for the first time. An added bonus of course is that Stavros will pick you up and drop you back to the airport at no extra charge. What a great guy.
3838303,Etienne July 2017 What a fantastic holidays. Stavros's recommandations were very good. The accommodation is near the beach  and near transports in common to move on the island. Undoubtedly  you will not find any better host close to here. Thank you again for all my friend.
3838303,Didier Et Amal June 2017 Stavros is very welcoming. He did his best to make us a perfect stay ! Great experience ;-)
3838303,Maia June 2017 Loved this place! My partner and I were in desperate need of some rest and relaxation and Stavros' place really helped us do that. Stavros even picked us up with our bikes and we had access to a neighbour's stunning swimming pool. Thoroughly recommended. Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Lucile June 2017 Stavros is really the perfect host ! He's s doing the best to make your stay enjoyable. He answered our questions very quickly before the stay. He picked us up from the airport at 4:00am despite the delay of our plane. He did everything before our arrival : renting car and things to eat (the fridge was full of food for our first few days). The appartment is in a terraced house but well separated and quiet. The studio is very clean  well equiped and really good located : in nature with olive trees fields and very close to the beach. Stravros kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed during the week and gave us good advices to discover Corfu. I totally recommand this place ! Thanks for all :)
3838303,Darya May 2017 I must say this has probably been my most pleasant airbnb experience so far. Stavros is a very friendly and polite person  and a real superhost! His place is very cosy and clean  and the village where it's situated is truly lovely. The local beach is a real gem. We were there at the beginning of the season but the combination of the fresh water and hot air was very pleasant. Highly recommended!
3838303,Julian May 2017 A real pleasure to stay here - amazing location - surrounded by nature and Stavros was very friendly and hospitable!
3838303,Gabrielle May 2017 Nice place  quiet  wonderfull beach not far <3
3838303,Choral April 2017 Everything was perfect. Stavros was an extraordinary. He goes above and beyond to make sure that you have everything you need to have a wonderful experience. The studio was very clean and comfortable. Mirtiotissa beach is only a short walk away and so is the market. I can't wait to visit again in the future.
3838303,Michael April 2017 Amazing  peaceful location. Stavros is really helpful and communicative. Accommodation is clean and modern. Would stay again.
3838303,Matt April 2017 Stavros is an incredibly attentive and kind host. He was ready and willing to help in any way he could to make our stay perfect. The room was wonderful and it is in such a beautiful location close to the beach and in nature. You must stay here if you come to Corfu.
3838303,Kath October 2016 Stavros was an excellent host! He always answered all of our questions before the stay  really quickly. He came to pick us up from the airport and returned us there as well  which made our journey so much easier. We arrived to a lovely clean apartment and the fridge was full of food for our first few days. The apartment was as advertised and the setting was really quiet and peaceful. The area was very beautiful and good for walking and swimming...so many lovely flowers and olive groves! Stavros kept in touch to make sure we had everything we needed during the week. This was our first visit to Corfu and we found everyone very friendly...we even had a lesson in basic Greek from the bus conductor!
3838303,Dan October 2016 Had an awesome time staying at Stavros' place  he was a fantastic host and the accommodation was extremely well appointed in almost every respect. I don't think I've had better hospitality through air bnb! Thanks again
3838303,Naomi October 2016 This is a great little space in a very quiet part of Corfu. Set just off a one-lane road to Mirtiotissa beach (about 10 min walk)  its a very lovely place. Stavros is a great host that makes sure you are arriving ok  have everything you need  and is lovely to chat to as well. The studio itself was cool and spacious  with everything you need  including for cooking - Stavros even had the fridge stocked with some supplies to tide me over! There is outdoor seating  parking  lovely forests walks nearby  and much greenery. The stars are also amazing! If you are looking for a quiet  relaxing place where you don't to worry about much besides swimming  sunbathing  walking  and sleeping  this is it. Thanks again Stavor
3838303,Francesca September 2016 Stavros is a perfect host. The fridge was full of everything you can have for breakfast. I loved the location: very quiet and surrounded by nature. The beautiful beach of Mirtiotissa is very close. Unfortunately weather was not that good during my stay  I would have liked to stay longer!
3838303,Constanze September 2016 Stavros is a super-nice host and does anything to comfort me. He even welcomed me with bread  water and a filled refrigerator - that was really exceptional. I especially enjoyed the nice terasse right within the nature. Thank you for the pleasant stay!
3838303,Rachel August 2016 Staying at Stavros's was like staying at a friends. He collected us from the port and made us feel instantly safe and welcome. The house is immaculate and has everything you could need. The surrounding area and beach are beautiful  i only wished we could have stayed longer. We traveled around quite a bit and this was my favorite stop of the holiday. Highly highly recommended :)
3838303,Antje July 2016 I had a very nice stay in Mirtiotissa at Stavros´ apartment. Everything was as described and Stavros even picked me up in another place quite far away. He had a nice surprise in the refrigerator : it was filled with nice Greek things to eat and also lovely peaches and tomatoes. Supermarket is not far away- so you don´t really need a car if you just want to relax and enjoy the beach. Great stay!
3838303,Riccardo July 2016 We had a very pleasant stay in our 3 nights at Stavros apartment. He welcomed us with many things to eat and drink and he was kind to explain all the things to see nearby. The location is nice too  in a quiet area and surrounded by the green olive trees. The apartment has all that you need  and however the host is really kind if you may need something else. We felt really good in our stay and we surely would come back again.
3838303,Uros July 2016 Stavros is 100% reliable and a nice person to chat with. His studio is cute and very well equipped. The environment is relaxed  you can walk to the appealing (but nudist :-( Mirtiotissa beach but the path back is long and steep. Without kids you can make it though. As well as to the nearby Kellia village where there are some authentic tavernas like the Spiros' one. If you like some peace you're safe with Stavros' studio.
3838303,Ed June 2016 Stavros is the best host you could ever imagine. He's helpful yet respectful of your space. The studio is lovely and cool inside with a sweet but practical kitchen. Outside is a great patio with a straw roof that takes away the heat of the midday sun. There's also a hammock and a large table and 4 chairs that you can use. You're very close to the beach and Linda's mini market is about a 10 minute walk away. All-in-all I couldn't have hoped for a better holiday. My 2 year old had the time of her life largely due to Stavros' kindness  thoughtfulness and generosity.  Thank you Stavros and see you soon! Ed  Karoline and Poppy
3838303,Mirjam May 2016 Stavros was an amazing host! He was always happy to help and even filled the fridge before our arrival. He did everything to make our stay as pleasant as possible. He arranged that a scooter was delivered to the house and picked up after we left. This ways we could explore the entire island! The apartment is very modern and provides everything you need. You can walk to 3 different beaches. If you stay at Stavros'  make sure to eat at the Spiros Taverna in the nearby village! We had a great time in Mirtiotissa!!!
3838303,Denislava May 2016 We had wonderful time at Stavros' studio! It was exactly as described  me and my family (husband and 7-year-old) had everything we needed plus the warm welcoming and extra help from Stavros who was giving us a lift from and to airport  guided us on what to see and where to go  helped us renting a car and was available online for every question we had. The studio is in the perfect spot on the Western part  close to the most beautiful beaches on the island. My first visit to Corfu will be long remembered and I already want to go back. Thank you  Stavros!
3838303,Jelles May 2016 Stavros was a warm and welcome host  a really nice guy. It was a pleasure staying in his appartment. During our stay we could always reach him in case we had some questions.
3838303,Barbara May 2016 Stavros is definitely a super host! First of all he picked me up from the airport at 5:30 AM!. He had stocked my kitchen with lots of delicious foods. There is also a fairly complete supply of spices and oils etc. as well as all the pots and pans and utensils you could need. Stavros was so kind and considerate and helpful with anything I might have needed. He even drew me a little map so I could find my way walking around the area. He took me back to the airport for my return as well.The studio is very very clean  and in a beautiful location. And I loved the fireflies at night! It is not a far walk to the bus stop shop and beach. I felt very safe and comfortable there. I cannot thank Stavros enough for making my stay so very special. I would love to return for another visit!
3838303,Claudia October 2015 It is a wonderful place there and Stavros was very kind and helpful. We enjoyed the stay in this little paradise spot.
3838303,Veronique September 2015 I must say I fell in love with the place right upon arrival. The surroundings are wonderful  immersed in nature in total peace and quietness. Stavros is a wonderful person and a great host  always ready to give help. He greeted us very early in the morning and the house was full of supplies. It's really clean and has everything one needs. Internet reception is very good. We were blessed to have very nice neighbours at the other half of the house and even when the weather was thundery and rainy it was a wonderful experience. The beach nearby is easily reachable by walk (careful with the last 100m as they are very steep) and I must say it's one of the most beautiful beaches I've visited while in Corfu. There's a path between the olive trees to reach a mini market and a bus stop (Glyfada-Corfu Town) not far away but I personally think it's best to hire a car as at night the street is dark as there are no lamp posts. The island is wonderful and I can't wait to get back  I will definitely stay at Stavros' place again  I miss it already! Thanks Stavros!
3838303,Diana September 2015 Stavros is the perfect  charming host. His studio is perfect and soo relaxing and quiet. Stavros was respectful of our privacy but always accessible if we needed any advice however small. The studio is basic but has everything you need and is just a 15 min walk from a beautiful beach. I would highly recommend this studio to anyone wanting a relaxing   peaceful holiday.
3838303,Oliver August 2015 The house is wonderful!! During our 10 day stay we checked out many beaches all around Corfu and Mirtiotissa is the most beautiful!! The house is just a ten minute walk from the house (very steep though and I do not recommend to drive down by car  we saw many accidents down there). The house (double house  there are neighbors next door) is in a completely peaceful surrounding and it is lovely to just sit outside and enjoy the trees and the birds. The house is all you need and actually nicer than on the pictures. Stavros makes sure that you have all you need. He is very nice and drops in every now and then and makes sure that you have a nice little chat and that you have all you need. So: Very  very big recommendation!!  PS: Make sure to ask Stavros about the hidden trail to the mini market  which goes through the olive grove. It is wonderful.  PPS: Some personal favorites: Pelekas  Giannades  Korfu Town  Lefkimmi  Avlaki. Overrated: Glifada  Paleokastritsa (too many people). Show more
3838303,Melanie July 2015 Stavros is a complete star- friendly  hospitable  kind and interesting to chat to. We arrived later than expected at night after a flight delay  yet Stavros waited for us so he could show us the amenities  tell us a bit about the area etc. His communication with us before  during and after our visit was brilliant. He left various supplies for us in the fridge which we hadn't expected too  so it was great to not have to have to worry about buying things at this time of night. The studio was really lovely- nicely renovated  all mod cons- in fact we really do not think the photos do it justice. The area it is in is beautiful too- really peaceful and quiet  and ten minutes walk to the stunning beach at Mirtiotissa- really one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen (and I've done a lot of travelling!) We cannot recommend Stavros and these lovely studios enough  and are really looking forward to staying there again in the future.
3838303,Natascha October 2014 We spent our summer holidays in Stavros' apartment and it was just perfect. Stavros is the best host you can wish for: open  funny  reliable and always available. He treated us like friends not like guests. He even waited for us until 11 pm on the day of our arrival.  The studio is located near the most beautiful beaches on Corfu: Glyfada and Mirtiotissa. You can reach the small and very quiet  cute Mirtiotissa beach by walking down the road. It is a wonderful walk through the olive trees. As everywhere on Corfu it is a little hike down a hill but good to keep in shape :) It is also near Pelekas which is a wonderful small village on a hill with nice tavernas and a breathtaking view on the sea. The house is located in a very quiet area - no direct neighbours  just nature. Which is perfect for spending some private time  escape the usual stress and just relax.  The studio is very clean and has everything you need. Stavros even gave us a bottle of house wine and provided us with food for breakfast (bread  water  juice  milk  grapes etc.) for the next morning.  If you come to Corfu to enjoy quietness  non-touristy beaches  nature and the Corfu culture you should stay with Stavros!  Show more
3838303,Karine October 2022 A pearl if you like a relaxing stay with a fantastic host  in a beautiful place in the middle of nature with lots of privacy. In the cottage  everything you need has been thought of. Stavros had put groceries in the fridge for us  bread  fruits  water  what extremely thoughtful! Stavros is as relaxed as the place you are staying  what a lovely person! The place is also totally ok if you like walking. We have done pieces of the Corfu trail and the mountain trail that can be picked up close to the cottage. Also  if you go behind Elia tavern  you can come down a short descent to Glyfada Beach  where even if you walk all the way through is a nudist beach  much quieter than Mirtiotissa beach. Another gem is Hawaii restaurant just in front of Pelekas  which you can walk to in 45 minutes. A paradise with a swimming pool and sun beds  with very sweet people who will pamper you completely and with a fantastic kitchen  where we had the best meal and where you can see beautiful sunsets. Pelekas is a nice village anyway with a bakery and typical Greek restaurants and beautiful views over the sea. The supermarket a 10-minute walk from the cottage is also very nice with nice people and everything you need. It is also a kind of village cafe where Greeks drink coffee and beer  typical Greek. In short  plenty to do near the cottage and also a day of relaxing and reading at the cottage is completely okay. Thank you Stavros! Show more Translated from Dutch  Show original
3838303,Gilles August 2022 Studio well suited for two people. Centrally located for visiting the island and for a morning swim on the nearby beach. Absolute calm and discretion.

3838303,Apostolos July 2021 Stavros's lodging is set amidst nature and provides the ideal conditions for relaxation and relaxation. The place is beautiful and spotless  it has everything one needs for a comfortable stay for a few or more days  while it is close to the wonderful beach of Myrtiotissa. As a host  Stavros was impeccable  took care of every detail  and was generally available to meet every need or provide local information. At the reception the refrigerator was filled with various items for breakfast or snacks. Hope to have the opportunity to stay again soon at Stavros' lodging and of course I highly recommend it.

3838303,Eugene July 2021 If you a going to visit a quite and peaceful place  this one is suitable for you. Near you just a nature and amazing views. The nearest beach the best we have found in Corfu in terms of desolation  but car is necessary because of steep way. But if you wish it is possible to overcome it ;)  Apartment is clean a really good.  If you decide to stay here  this is a great place to stay! Silence and tranquility  no noise at all  a couple of hippies live nearby  the beach is a 20-minute walk away  but difficult. By car  no problem at all  if it is difficult to park downstairs near the cliff  you can go up the climb. The beach is nudist  so be prepared :) We were a family and everyone liked it. Have a nice stay! Translated from Russian  Show original

3838303,Doris May 2019 What else could you say that it was perfect. Stavros is a thoughtful and responsive being without being invasive. He had planned everything so that we didn't lack enough to stock up on when we arrived. He helped us get to know the island by letting us know what to expect. The place is perfectly located  calm and serenity are part of it. Anyway  you'll understand  it was great! Thanks Stavros Translated from French  Show original

3838303,Jessica April 2019 The little house near Stavros is fantastic. It is nestled between trees  picturesque overlooking the mountain and beach and sea in a quarter of an hour walking distance. Stavros is super nice and is available for any question. In between  he asked if we needed anything and let the neighboring supermarket know that new guests were coming so that they could replenish their supplies (we were there before the season) Overall a great stay and I'm sure we'll be back!

3838303,Nicolas July 2018 Stavros' studio is located in the middle of nature away from all the hustle and bustle. Stavros is a smiling  attentive person who is always ready to help us. The studio is well equipped and contains everything you need to settle in with a few extra touches in the fridge. The sandy beach is a 10-minute walk away (very sloping road  difficult to access by car). Mini market  bus stop and restaurant nearby but still below.  Great for a holiday away from it all. Stavros remains our most beautiful Airbnb meeting. Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Christina June 2018 A wonderful stay in a beautiful setting. With a very friendly owner. If you like peace  nature and freedom this place is fantastic. You sit on the terrace and hear the birds around you  delicious. Stavros picked us up from the bus station and took us to the cottage. The cottage was clean and nice and in a fantastic place. In the cottage was everything you could need. Stavros groceries done  a fridge full of all kinds of food. I've never experienced anything like this before. Normally there is 1 bottle of water  but this...... He was attentive and asked several times during our stay how we had it and if we needed anything. After a week  it was hard to say goodbye. I hope that this lovely stay will be lived in by everyone with respect so that it stays the same. Translated from Dutch  Show original
3838303,Georgy November 2017 Everything was great! The host is very hospitable. The house is in a wonderful location  with a good view. Wonderful beach very close to the house. Translated from Russian  Show original
3838303,Thomas August 2017 We stayed 3 nights in Stavros apartment. Stavros was the best host some could ask for! He picked us up from the airport late at night and always went out of his way during our stay and always in contact with us. The property is located on a small hill in a talk boiler  nicely nestled in nature. Away from mass tourism and traffic noise. The house is divided into two apartments  but they are well separated from each other. So it's very private. The furnishings of the apartment are simple and not new  but very clean and well maintained. Mirtiotissa Beach is a 15-minute walk (the road is very steep)  and a mini-market is just a 5-minute walk away. The beach is great and spared from commercial tourism. Stavros provided us with a scooter  which we rented for a day to take a look at the surroundings. All in all  we enjoyed the stay very much and can only recommend Stavros! Translated from German  Show original
3838303,Véro June 2017 Stavros is a lovely and very kind boy. He picked us up from the airport and left us food in the fridge.

We enjoyed our stay at Stavros very much and if we return to Corfu one day  it will be with great pleasure in this beautiful place. Highly recommend!Thanks again Stavros!

3838303,Helene June 2017 We spent 5 days at Stavros and regret not having taken more . Stavros is a host who knows how to host from the moment you arrive. Her place is a little slice of heaven. It is exactly as described on the site  better as we are there!!! We will share his address with our friends without any worries. Bring a vehicle to get around   if you are a good walker   at the limit you can get by without passing by . Thanks Stavros   we'll be back . Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Ruth April 2017 Nice studio  cozy and clean. The equipment is primarily tailored to two people. Cooking your own is also no problem  but there are also restaurants nearby that are open even in the pre-season. A good starting point for hikes. Own mobility is beneficial. A car can be parked within the fenced garden. Best care by the host. Translated from German  Show original

3838303,Rudolf September 2016 Stavros is a lovely  attentive  and welcoming host. The place was better than we expected. Very quiet location  shop and restaurant is 10 minutes walk  bus stop. Translated from Czech  Show original
3838303,Louis September 2016 Statvros deserves its super host title because he is very considerate ( offers to pick you up from the airport  leaves plenty of living available to cook  is naturally friendly and helpful ) ... The accommodation is an ideal cabin for nature lovers  simple and efficient ( all equipment needed in the kitchen( except washing machine) and air conditioning if necessary with a beautiful terrace (and no visual pollution to appreciate the starry sky) and quiet and which is located in one of the most naturey corners of Corfu ( 7th stay on this beautiful island that we know so well ) and this area is really excellent with the proximity of the myrtiotissa serenity which is a dream beach and daydream. A tip in every way for backpackers in search of authenticity. Translated from French  Show original
3838303,Catherine August 2016 He greeted us at the airport with a smile despite the late hour...He was attentive to our needs   was very specific to make our stay pleasant. A nice meeting. Translated from French  Show original

3838303,Elisa July 2016 we booked Stavros' house 6 months in advance but 1 month before arriving he told us that there was a problem with the reservation and that other people had booked before us. He quickly found us a solution by offering several alternatives . Finally  we opted for a studio at Casa Elia  which was great  close to the beach and with a great restaurant. Stavros has been very kind to us  always making sure everything was fine. Translated from Spanish  Show original
3838303,Kay-Uwe June 2016 In the summer of 2014 we were in Corfu for the first time and discovered this great region around Mirtiotissa Beach. This time in 2016 we wanted to spend our vacation right there. From the very first contact  Stavros was a very accommodating host who responded to emails within the shortest possible time. Stavros picked us up from the airport and brought us back  a great service He had also filled the fridge as a welcome gift  there was everything to get over the first days. Stavros is a very open and warm person who could be reached at any time and was also available in case of problems. The apartment was very clean and furnished with everything you need. On the next Corfu holiday we will return to this accommodation.  Since we were there without a rental car  we explored the surroundings on foot. In the village  about a 10-minute walk through the olive grove  there is a small shop where everything can be bought. The beach (actually nudist  but some people were also dressed there) is about 10 to 15 minutes away (back it takes a little longer because of the slope)  the descent to the beach is a motorized challenge  but it is definitely worth it  as this is a wonderful place where  in addition to the great cooling in the Mediterranean  you can also get chilled drinks  yogurt with fruits and baguette for cheap money.  There are also two restaurants within 15 minutes  which offer very good food. About 8 minutes is a bus stop from Greenbuses  where the buses go to Corfu Town (€1.80 pp).  It was a great week in Stavros apartment  we look forward to coming back.  Stavros  you are great and we have enjoy the time at your apartment.

3838303,Carole October 2015 Super studio with everything you need! Stravos even left us an almost stocked fridge as a gift. Thank you very much!

3838303,Roland June 2015 Our host Stavros received us very warmly at the agreed time in his listing which was completely as described by him. The studio is located in the middle of nature and in total calm. The countryside is very beautiful and the sea is a 5-minute drive. Stavros was kind enough to provide us with provisions to start the stay. If we can come back it will be with pleasure in this beautiful place. Thanks again Stavros!

35279483,Ryanne June 2019 We could not have imagined a better host for our amazing holiday in Greece. Pelekas was a great choice  and so was the apartment we spent it in. Close to several stunning beaches  it was best to rent a scooter. The home was gorgeous and extremely clean  having the comfort of airconditioning in every room and a large refrigerator. Two balconies that alternated each other during the day by providing shade either in the morning or the afternoon. The home is situated in the main road of Pelekas  so things like small supermarkets and restaurants are walking distance. Loannis and Fani were amazing hosts that truly did their best to make our stay here as enjoyable as possible  giving great recommendations and even organizing a barbecue with the other tenants. If we ever visit Corfu again we will not hesitate to book this apartment again! (Even if it were only for the amazing gyros grillroom nextdoor.)

22726458,Valerie November 2022 Beautiful view from the balcony and easy access to the beach with private parking. Eleni’s communication was great. The location may be better during the summer season  it felt a bit dreary and soulless in November despite the sunshine. The pool looked like it hadn’t been operational for a while and the whole complex could do with a refresh and a clean (which might happen in season)
22726458,Toby September 2022 We had a lovely 1-week stay at Eleni’s apartment. The best thing about it is it looks onto a wonderful sandy beach  and it has a beautiful sea view in both of the main rooms. You can hear the waves as you go to sleep  and each morning we opened the curtains to the wonderful view. The sea was clear and warm to swim in as we soaked in the picturesque surroundings. Eleni was a very helpful and communicative host - we especially appreciated that when we asked if she could recommend a taxi company  she arranged the taxi for us! This was really helpful and made the process very smooth for us. She was quick to respond to any questions and very friendly to talk to. Check-in was easy and instructions were clear.  There isn’t much in Glyfada besides the beach and a couple of very small shops/restaurants. This helped to make it a quiet and relaxing experience  and we spent most of our days on the beach - we loved sitting on the sand and watching the sunset every evening. Since we didn’t rent a car  we decided to do a big food shop at Lidl in Corfu’s main town  which is why we wanted a taxi for our shopping. Otherwise  Glyfada is served by a good bus service into the main town  which was frequent enough (once every couple of hours) - this made it easy for us to enjoy some days out  both in the main town and at Aqualand.  The apartment was clean but the shower curtain was a little mouldy. The kitchen was very well-equipped with a freezer box inside the fridge  mini oven and hob  coffee machine  kettle  and all the utensils we could have needed for a week-long stay  making it easy to cook our meals. Unfortunately  the mattresses were very hard and my partner actually struggled to sleep as a result - the trundle bed in the other room was more comfortable  so she used that. The sofa could also have been more comfortable. The only lighting in each room was the main overhead light - this certainly isn’t a dealbreaker but it could be improved with some fairy lights. The wifi worked most of the time but it was intermittent in the evenings.  Overall  we enjoyed our stay and loved being able to walk down to such a beautiful beach. Eleni was a helpful and communicative host and the apartment served our needs. Show more
22726458,Jana August 2022 Cosy place with a beautiful balcony and an amazing view of the beach and the sea. The apartments is reachable by steep steps  which was for us a little uncomfortable because we had a buggy. Otherwise this wouldn't be a problem.
22726458,Emma August 2022 The host was really nice and helped with everything. Apartment was amazing and there were everything you could need. I can really recomend Eleni and her apartment!
22726458,Ioann July 2022 Great place to be  great location and accommodation  and communication as well. Best beach at Corfu on my opinion  the sandy one and with crystal clear water! Eleni was incredible host  everything was perfect :)
22726458,Em July 2022 We’ve just got back from a fabulous weeks stay at Eleni’s place. She was an excellent host and we couldn’t ask for anything more. She was always on hand to answer questions and help with local information. The location is superb and ideal if you’re coming with little ones. 25 mins from airport  15 mins from Aqualand water park which we visited twice. The apartment has wonderful views over the beach and has easy access to beautiful sandy beach and clear  shallow waters. Lots of restaurants and bars available in the resort with free access to a fresh water swimming pool between 10.30am-6.30pm. There’s also a very well stocked shop and your own car parking space. We are already planning our return trip.
22726458,Matej July 2022 Awesome
22726458,Matias June 2022 Eleni's apartment was amazing  it was this magic view  and the sounds of the waves to sleep at night were magical. It really has everything that you need for staying a couple of days. The quick answers and attention to detail from Eleni were definitely a +1 .  If you want to go to probably the best beach in Corfu to have a chill-out experience  look no more.
22726458,Gulzhan June 2022 The place  we stayed in Corfu island  is very beautiful and calm. The beach is very close to the apartment. The sand is silky. Those  who have a child  this place is very comfortable to arrive to the beach. The amasing thing of this apartment  you listen wave sounds while you sleep and it is sort of meditation not only for you and also for your child. The host  Eleni  supported and helped us during our stay. Thank you again!
22726458,Alexandru June 2022 We had a great stay here. The place was clean  comfortable  fully equipped and very close to the beach. the view from the balcony was great  perfect place for hanging out before and after the beach. Eleni was always fast to respond and provided help for getting there from the airport. all in all it was worth the money and we will come again in the future. thank you
22726458,Alfred April 2022 Splendid location overlooking Glyfada Beach. Comfortable and clean apartnent. Very friendly welcome on check-in. Altogether a superb holiday.
22726458,Lauren April 2022 We stayed in Eleni's beautiful apartment from end of March to the beginning of April! Despite everywhere nearby being shut and not renting a car  we still had such a lovely time and the apartment had everything you could need to cook.  The selling point is definitely the proximity to the beach (literally 2 minutes!) and the huge balcony. Even though the weather wasn't amazing  we had our morning coffees on the beach and still sat under the balcony when it rained. Although a car would have been handy  Pelekas is only an hour walk away and we enjoyed the hike there as the views were amazing.  Niko picked us up from the airport and was extremely understanding when our flight was delayed  even taking us to a 24hr supermarket! On our last day  he took for a little explore in the car around Corfu Town before dropping us at the airport and it was one of the highlights of our trip - meeting lovely hosts and their team is what makes staying in Airbnbs amazing.  We'll definitely be back  thank you so much! Show more
22726458,Piotr August 2021 Great people! Wonderful place! I definitely recommend it!
22726458,Katharina August 2021 We really had a nice stay at Glyfada Beach Resort. Eleni is a wonderful host and was very helpful with every question we had and gave us great recommendations.  The apartment is simple  but nice. The Beach is super close to the apartment and the view is stunning. The beach was never to busy. There are some nice restaurants/Cafes around and you can do some shopping in the mini markets.  We did not have a car around  but you can easily take a taxi or go by bus.  We really want to come back and can definitely recommend to stay at the apartment :) Thanks again to you  Eleni and Nikos :)
22726458,Leonid July 2021 The hostess is excellent. Kind  responsive  always in touch. I helped a lot during my vacation. Questions such as the COVID 19 test before driving. etc.
22726458,Ramune July 2021 This is an amazing place with a breathtaking view! The apartment is equiped with everything you might need. The spacious private parking lot is just downstairs. Eleni  the hostess  is very thoughtful and caring. I would highly recommend this place for your stay.  Ramunė Vilnius  Lithuania
22726458,Nigel@Pathobby.Com September 2020 Property as described and we had an enjoyable stay  thoroughly recommend
22726458,Noujoud September 2020 Eleni is very helpful and understanding. She really made our stay easy and wonderful. Also  the view from the appartement is amazing and sunset on the beach is wonderful. Location was great for us to discover the whole island.
22726458,Hannah August 2020 Such a perfect spot  a perfect little apartment  a really great host and replied almost instantly whenever I needed anything! The view from the balcony is unreal! I will definitely be coming back!
22726458,Sanne August 2020 Eleni's apartment was a very good choice. A warm welcome by Nikos in a clean and fully equipped apartment. The location is very nice because you have a beautiful vieuw of the Glyfada beach. I would defenately recommand this apartment!
22726458,Luisa October 2019 We had a very nice stay at Eleni's place. The beach is wonderful and the view from the balcony is really stunning!  A tip for those  who travel to Corfu for the first time - renting a car is really worth it (around 100m by feet from the airport away)  because you can reach nice places better by car. Plus  grocery shopping is pretty expansive in the resort's store  so it's easier for you to go shopping by car in another city nearby.
22726458,Gilles August 2019 Glyfada is an idyllic beach on the west coast of Corfu. It's a bit isolated  so a car is a must unless you eat at the few tavernes all your meals. The sea there is crystal clear  amazingly crystal clear! It is quite safe for young children and there are activities there for older children too. The apartment is a few minutes walk from the beach. Hiking up the stairs can be tough in the very hot hours of the day  but the refreshing air conditioning cools you off quickly. The mattresses in the bedroom are on the harder side  the kitchenette could have more dishes  but the view from the balcony makes you forget these little details. Eleni was outstanding when she communicated to us: she gave us tips when we needed them  provided a baby bed  allowed to extend our stay a few hours as our flight was an evening flight. Nikos came to greet up and assisted us with the suitcases. The apartment is in the middle for the resort  with no direct car access  so when you come and when you leave you have to carry your bags up or down  whether you use the parking down the hill  or the upper gate. Glyfada is a popular beach  so the public parking right outside the main gate can get really crowded  and you might end us being locked in. Pazuzu is a lounge right next to Menigos Resort. It's a bit loud during the day  but never annoyingly loud. It is closed in the evening  so you can enjoy quiet evening on the balcony  listening to the soothing sound of the waves hitting the beach. There is a choice of local tavernes around Menigos Resort  but stay away from Golden Beach: it's over price for what they serve. We drove a few times to Pelekas village  where there are many local options for dinner. We will come back to Glyfada! Show more
22726458,Steve July 2019 Nice location with a lovely view.
22726458,Alicia July 2019 Just as beautiful as it looks in the pictures! The balcony is a true highlight. Could not have asked for a better host  our flight arrived superearly and Eleni+Niko went out of their way to make everything as comfortable as possible for us. We felt very well taken care of and had a great stay!
22726458,Danijel April 2019 Very nice place to stay. My family enjoyed the Glifada and Corfu island. Nice view from the apartment. No problem with check in and out  Niko is very helpful guy. I recommend! Danijel
22726458,Christa April 2019 Wonderful Hosting by Eleni! We loved the balcony  the view and the close beach at a beautiful spot!
22726458,Nina April 2019 It features an amazing balcony so you can sit in the sun all day. The beach is just 5 min away and very pretty and you can hear the waves at the place all day.
22726458,Karoline October 2018 Eleni arranged a late Check-in for us  hence our arrival was very uncomplicated. We were warmly welcomed by Nico at the entrance gate to the Resort in which the apartment is located. Nico showed us around  helped us carry our bags and along with Eleni they gave us very handy and useful tips. The apartment is very well equipped and we weren't in need of anything. (coffee + coffee machine  a hair dryer  lots of towels  air conditioning  Wlan  cold beverages for oyr arrival etc.). The view from the balcony is breathtaking and you wake up to the sound of the waves  to a wonderful landscape consisting of the sea  the golden beach and mountains every morning. By car Corfu Town can be reached within 35 minutes; same applies to Paleokastritsa and Agios Gordius. Sidari and the Canal d'Amour can be reached within a little bit over an hour. Overall Eleni was very helpful during the time of our stay. She answered any of our questions very quickly and overall our communication with her was very effortless and easy. We had a wonderful time at Glyfada Beach and really recommend anyone to spend their vacation there!
22726458,Eva September 2018 We had a great stay at Glyfada. The beach is beautiful  the water is very clear and the apartment has a great view. The mattresses are a bit hard  but Eleni is a great hostess and she replied always very kind and quickly. I recommend it to everyone!
22726458,Raphael July 2018 The appartment corresponds exactly to the description and we (couple  30y  France) recommand it ! The view is perfect  Eleni received us very well (for ex  let at our arrival apples  botles of water...) Excellent communication before  during and after our stay !! Only the bed could be improved because not very confortable. We are at 1min walk from the sand beach  restaurants and mini-market. There is several direct GreenBuses to come from Corfu easily in 45min. Thanks Eleni
22726458,Sarah July 2018 The apartment is nice  cosy and perfect for three people. The location is near the beach and there is everything you need. Eleni was very helpful and hospitable. We had a great time there!
22726458,Andrea June 2018 Our stay in Eleni’s apartment in beautiful Glyfada was perfect. The apartment was prepared with the utmost care and was very clean and comfortable. You have to climb a few stairs to reach the apartment  but well worth the great seaview! Niko s was also great and friendly! We hope to visit Corfù in the future and we would only want to stay at Glyfada beach at Eleni’s place!
22726458,Marine May 2018 We spent a wonderful weekend at Eleni’s flat. The view is wonderful and the beach is just a 5min walk. It’s very well located and Glyfada is a really peaceful beach. Eleni kindly let us do an early check-in  and we were very well welcomed by Nikos. The communication with Eleni was really good and she also gave us a very good tips for renting a car. We would love to go back and we highly recommend Eleni’s flat!
22726458,Tim April 2018 The view from the apartment is really lovely and it would make a great base in Glyfada. Handy for the Corfu Trail too as it continues from the end of the beach. Very clean  tidy and well equipped. Air con with heating too if required. The host was quick to respond and check-in was easy. Highly recommend.
22726458,Annika April 2018 We had a wonderful stay in Elenis apartment!! Communication was great. The view from the balcony is amazing and the beach is just 2 minutes by walking and super beautiful :) very recommendable!
22726458,Daniel August 2022 Everything is perfect!! Translated from Dutch  Show original
22726458,Thomas August 2022 Very well furnished apartment with a superb balcony and sea views that you can't get enough of. We did not meet our host  all instructions to reach the rental are sent by message and are very well done. Very good communication. Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Karen August 2021 Eleni is a particularly warm  attentive and very available host. She picked us up from the airport to show us the road  took over with the car landlord who wasn't there  and made our arrival very easy. The apartment is in a great location  with beautiful views. Simple  clean  and ideal for resting without moving  or even going on a tour of the island. I highly recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Natasha July 2021 We had a lovely time at Glyfada beach. The apartment is good  clean and the view is just beautiful. The sea and dining with the pool are a 5 minute walk away. Eleni was very responsive and accommodating and these friends who came for our transfer and the very pleasant and charming welcome. I would highly recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Nicolas September 2019 We had a great time at Eleni's place. The communication was perfect and so was the welcome (Niko even helped us get the suitcase up on arrival as well as our departure). The apartment has everything you need  and we especially enjoyed the balcony ! This one is very large  the armchairs are comfortable and the sea views are breathtaking  it was very nice to have breakfast in these conditions. The sandy beach is very close  just go down a few stairs to reach it. We recommend this apartment 100%. Translated from French  Show original
22726458,Maria September 2019 Small but complete with everything and Eleni was super available! It overlooks a beautiful sandy beach with clear and low water (suitable for little ones) very quiet place to relax. Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Aram July 2019 Very relaxing accommodation equipped with everything including products  nice sea view from the terrace and very nice beach both equipped and free. For families but also for young people (The Pazuzu beach bar attracts a lot). Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Sarah May 2019 We had a great time in the apartment. The location and especially the balcony are great. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Claudia May 2019 The accommodation 145 of Elenis Appartments has a magnificent view of the sea. There is a nice restaurant on the beach with good food and a supermarket. The rooms make a neat impression  at first glance. Unfortunately  the toilet and kitchen are not particularly clean. In the worn toilet brush  thick blocks of cracks stick on  the dirty dishcloths and sponges could only be disposed of with sharp fingers  we had to get a tea towel ourselves. The stove tops were covered with dirty food scraps  which  however  would have been easy to remove. Conclusion: It simply does not be cleaned or used and stained items are replaced. Very unappetizing. And at €60 per night in the pre-season also not acceptable in a civilized country. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Kerstin September 2018 One thing that should be highlighted is communication. Eleni is extremely attentive and hospitable. Check-in is also perfectly arranged. Upon our arrival  Nico welcomed us very kindly. He helped us carry our luggage. As a welcome  Nico gave us cold drinks and a large bowl of fruit. In the apartment you will find plenty of towels  toilet paper  hand soap and cleaning products. The view from the balcony is magnificent. You fall asleep to the sound of the sea. The golden sandy beach is a few steps away and beautiful. Three of us had enough space in the apartment. We only had the quality of the mattresses to fault. All three of them are extremely hard. Translated from German  Show original
22726458,Vasileios August 2018 Great stay and hospitality in a great location. Helen and Nikos met all our expectations promptly and with exceptional professionalism  in order to make the stay and the holiday even more pleasant. Thank you so much! Translated from Greek  Show original
22726458,Giancarlo July 2018 Very nice accommodation: when we arrived at the main entrance of the Meningos Resort (complex of tourist houses but very discreet) Nico waited for us who showed us the accommodation quickly but very thoroughly  he also helped us with our luggage because in fact there are some steps to do  but we were rewarded by the wonderful 180 view of the sea and Glyfada beach (absolutely the most beautiful of the many we have seen  ideal for children). The accommodation has a bedroom and a living room (double sofa bed) with each an exit to the generous terrace. The kitchen is very small but more than enough for a vacation  idem for the bathroom that has a shower with curtain. A fire extinguisher and first-aid kit are also helpful. Air conditioning throughout and relatively fast WiFi (for example  to watch TV on streaming). If it wasn't for the habit of never going back twice to the same place  I would go back tomorrow. Thanks for everything! Translated from Italian  Show original
22726458,Sophie April 2018 We had a wonderful week at Eleni's studio. The arrival and key handover was even very straightforward at night  we were warmly welcomed at the gate and introduced to the apartment by Nico. He had even arranged a bouquet of flowers with a welcome message  a small breakfast for the next morning and showed us the details (hair dryer  fully equipped kitchen (even with coffee  oil  spices  etc.)  towels  air conditioning  ...  unfortunately no Wi-Fi) . The view from the terrace is magnificent - you look directly at the sea  the mountains and have the sun on your face from the morning on. Pelekas is just a few minutes away  Corfu town can also be reached in a few minutes by car. Glyfada Beach is a beautiful beach where you can relax wonderfully and also see the sunset. Eleni and Nico were very friendly and help with their own concerns and questions immediately. We had a wonderful time! Translated from German  Show original Response from Eleni April 2018 Thank you so much! I am so glad you had a great time. We hope you come back and visit. Thank you for your wonderful review!
15976587,Danielle July 2022 I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this stay!!! It was such a relaxing oasis especially having the restaurant right under our place that we could go to as well as the beach every day if we didn’t want to go around the island. The rooms were nothing but clean and the house was extremely helpful and available.
15976587,Patrick July 2022 Nicos Studio is a very Beautiful Apartment with a fantastic Ocean view. Everything was clean  comfortable and nicely furnished. The beach is a peaceful and quiet Place. Everyone was nice and helpful. The tavern with its delicious food is also a must.
15976587,Dániel July 2022 Very nice and comfortable place. The house is in the middle of a pine forest  the view is beautiful. The beach is close to the house and it is very nice. People are friendly. You definitely need a car and some driving routine to get here  but it is fine. If you plan to visit the northern and southern parts of the island this is a geat location to be.
15976587,Maggie June 2022 This was an absolutely beautiful place to stay during our trip to Corfu - stunning location with crystal clear waters  beautiful olive groves and great snorkelling! A perfect little studio with great cooking facilities and exactly as described. Would definitely come again!
15976587,Rebecca June 2022 Just a beautiful spot for a quiet relaxing holiday directly on the sea. The taverna on the beach is traditional and perfect and the water and beach is quiet and beautiful. The apartments are lovely and the views from the balcony gorgeous. Everyone was so nice and friendly ❤️
15976587,Asta And Tomi June 2022 Nikos place is just perfect who is looking for a quite and cosy Shelter surrounded by nature and still you can find around everything you need. Yaliskari Restaurant is amazing  as well the view to the Sea ist fantastic. Nikos and Sofia are such a kind Persons. We will definetely come back to lovely yaliskari beach  all the Best for Yaliskari and his nice owners! Thank you
15976587,Georg October 2021 We spent 6 days in Yaliskari and it was an absolute dream! The beach and the surrounding pine forrest  the remote situation and the excellent taverne made us staying in the little bay for the whole 6 days. Especially if you just want to relax we highly recommend the apartments. The communication was easy and the room very clean. The hosts were absolutely charming and welcoming! And again  the food was amazing! Thank you guys so much again! We hope to come back one day!
15976587,Cristina June 2021 This is a place for nature lovers - you have both sea & mountain. The studio is perfectly cleaned & newly renovated. The view is breathtaking. Very beautiful walking of about 15 min to the supermarket. Everybody from Nick' family to Mirela are naturally kind and make you feel like home. An unforgettable experience! Response from Nick June 2021 Dear Christina   It was plesure to have you here. I hope you are happy and healthy .  Best regards  Nikos Show more
15976587,Georgi July 2020 The view from the balcony makes it all worthwhile - overlooking the South you see the see and can watch the sunrise and sunset from the comfort of your bed or balcony. 5 min down the road and you get to a small beach that never gets too crowded because of it's remote location. Hospitality at the beach taverna is also top quality.
15976587,Paulina October 2019 It was a pure pleasure to stay at this place. We were surprised with higher standard than we saw on pictures here. Apartment is renovated and the view from balcony is just outstanding. There was a little problem with electricity and WiFi due to thunderstorm  but Nick offered us a free meal in his tavern as a compensation. Apartment is located on hill surrounded with pine woods  the nearest beach Yaliskari is just few hundred meters and you can have nice meal just by the sea shore in tavern. If you're looking for perfect place  don't hesitate to book this one!
15976587,Arabella August 2019 Paradise! What can we say? Crystal clear waters  peaceful evenings  clean and comfortable rooms  fantastic seafood taverna  and lovely views from the balcony. Nikos and his team were extremely welcoming  and so helpful in providing advice and recommendations throughout our stay. We couldn't have asked for a more relaxing and romantic trip. Thank you!
15976587,Marc June 2018 The host canceled this reservation 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15976587,Jonathon June 2017 We enjoyed a fantastic stay at this family's studios at Yaliskari beach. The family were extremely kind and welcoming  and we enjoyed chats with them in the evening at the delicious Taverna located right on the beach. Great ocean views from the studios  a secluded beach which isn't packed  also there's the potential to go to the busier neighbouring 'Pelekas beach'  or walk for about half an hour up the (very steep) hill to Pelekas village which has outstanding views and a very cute  Greek village vibe with plenty of restaurants and a bus every couple of hours to Corfu Town. We loved our stay here.
15976587,Stephan October 2022 We had a wonderful ten days here in Nick's apartment number four. The view is simply a dream  the location beautifully quiet and private despite the six residential units. Down to the nearby beach it is only a two  three minute walk and the bay is simply idyllic and beautifully located. The water is crystal clear  partly stone but also a Sanstrand beach. The tavern beckons with a magnificent view of the bay and the sunset. The rooms were cleaned at our place in a two-day rhythm and provided with new towels and bed linen. Check-in etc. was absolutely hassle-free and straightforward  we got to know Nick as a nice and helpful host. We can absolutely recommend this place with the best knowledge. Translated from German  Show original
15976587,Detlev September 2022 We hated on a hike in 2021 by chance Yaliskari and the apartments discovered  and I wanted to be a guest there for a while. We did that this year in 2022  and it was the right choice. We had a relaxing  quiet time in the magnificent countryside. We found the apartment as described and were able to use it for 10 days as we had imagined. From the balcony you have a great view of the sea. That's great. In the evening  however  do not forget the mosquito repellent. Translated from German  Show original
15976587,Cornel July 2022 Unfortunately  almost everything is missing in the apartment for self-sufficiency  otherwise it is clean and the beach is nice  although unfortunately not well maintained  although loungers and umbrellas cost a little money during the day.

15976587,Petra June 2021 Pure relaxation in a small paradise! We had great communication with Nikos beforehand. So the anticipation was all the greater... Everything corresponded absolutely to the pictures  is in reality even more beautiful and if you want a relaxing vacation away from the hustle and bustle  Yaliskari Beach is absolutely in the right place. The studio and tavern corresponded exactly to our expectations  in addition to the wonderful hospitality - vacation among friends  we will be back! Many thanks to Nikos and his team  it was fun with you! Uli + Petra Translated from German  Show original

49912380,Christine April 2022 On-site communication with Adonis was very easy. It also gave us some good information. The place was well located with a nice view from the balcony. On the other hand  we were surprised that when we arrived at 7: 00 p.m.  the accommodation was neither defined nor ready. We had to wait until we made the bed in a home to access it. In addition  the cleanliness of this apartment left something to be desired (dirty dishes  bathroom with hair and hair). The wifi was very weak. The mattress was very uncomfortable. It's unfortunate because we really enjoyed the setting. Translated from French  Show original

26361078,Karen October 2022 The view from this apartment is breathtaking and you get a clear sunrise from your bed.The apartment is clean and comfortable with attention to detail...welcome pack   hairdryer  blinds on balcony amongst many nice additions. It is well positioned to walk to the charming local village  but the beach is quite a hike( about 30 mins). However well worth the walk and great cocktails at the taverna on the right .I would come back.Enjoy.
26361078,Athina September 2022 It was more than perfect in this wonderful Airbnb. Lucy is a very courteous kind host.  The subrise from bed is spectacular  the silence  the beautiful view over this wonderful island- it was everything we wanted.  Also the area is just perfect  as pelekas is my favorite village of this island with the most beautiful beach  100% recommended and i am sure we will be back  in this wonderful dreamy house We had the best summer week here.  Thank you for your kindness and clean beautiful apartment. Response from Lucy September 2022 Thank you for your kind words. We are so happy that you had a nice stay with us. You are always welcome at our home!
26361078,Lennie August 2022 We really enjoyed staying in this apartment. It’s very spacious for two people  with a beautiful bedroom and good airconditioning in the lounge and bedroom. The kitchen and bathroom can get very warm during the summer but you’ll be able to cool down in the other rooms. Lucy was lovely and very easygoing. She provided a lot of thoughtful extras that made us feel very welcome. The apartment is well-equipped and even has a parasol we could take with us to the beach. The best thing about this apartment is the view  it’s truly spectacular. From the balcony that spans the entire width of the apartment you can look across the entire island all the way to Corfu town and the sea. Closer by are beautiful verdant hills. Location-wise this apartment was perfect for us. It’s away from the touristy beach towns and the apartment is located up a set of outside stairs of a small and quiet building that has a few other apartments with  what seemed like  permanent residents. I would recommend a car or other motorised means of transport  although the bus stop is right up the road. Because of the central location it’s less than an hour to the northern and southern tip of the island by car and only 20 minutes to the center of Corfu town. The village of Pelekas is a 10min walk uphill  where you’ll find some good restaurants and a mini-market. Larger supermarkets are located closer to Corfu town  an easy 15-minute drive away. I’d fully recommend this place to anyone who wants to explore Corfu as well as visit its beautiful beaches  but wants to stay a bit further away from the tourist towns.

26361078,Kevin June 2022 Lucy is a wonderful host who knows how to help you if needed. She is really careful about the way our stay happens. The apartment is well located  not far from the beach and from Pelekas a cute village.
26361078,Victor Kjeldsen October 2021 We had a great stay at Lucy’s apartment with the best view over the beautiful landscape of Corfu. Lucy is a fantastic host.
26361078,Kotryna September 2021 The place was amazing! The view from the balcony is outstanding  you can watch a rising sun from it. A flat itself is super cozy and bright. The host was very sweet  we were greeted with snacks and Greek beer and wine. The house is located close to the Pelekas village where you can have Greek foods and drinks. I highly recommend this place!
26361078,Michał August 2020 It was a wonderful week we have spend in this apartment with our little family. The place itself was just like on the pictures: clean  cozy and cute! The view from both the bedroom and the living room is just stunning. Most importantly  Lucy has made us feel extremely welcome and taken care of. She would always suggest help  check in on us and just being her lovely self. The beach is just few minutes drive by car. The bus to the Corfu town is 1 minute away. And of course  all of the tavernas  are just 10/15 minutes away by feet. We really enjoyed our stay and hopefully will be back the next year!
26361078,Lidiya July 2020 The flat is very nice! Lucy provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay! The view from the balcony is spectacular and the two closest beaches are simply breathtaking! Highly recommended!
26361078,Matthieu September 2018 A very nice apartment  very quiet  ideally located in a village with stunning charm. The view is just splendid.
26361078,Thaddee September 2018 Nice place
26361078,Marko September 2018 Lucy is one of the best airbnb hosts I've met. She's always helpful and kind. The place is on the perfect spot close to Pelekas and the nearby beach. Much recommended!
26361078,Petru September 2018 We enjoyed our stay at Aurora very much. The apartment was very nice  clean and equipped with everything one might need for a week's stay. The view from the balcony is outstanding! Lucy was very kind  giving us some tips for places to visit. She also prepared us a welcoming package consisting of small things such as: some eggs  juice  coffee and a small bottle of wine  which we appreciated. As a small downside  the alley in front of the building is quite narrow and you need to take some care in order not to block someone else's car when parking. Overall  we think this apartment offered amazing value for the money we paid and we warmly recommend it to everyone.
26361078,Pablo October 2018 Lucy is lovely and very attentive: she left us coffee  fruit  etc; she told us a lot of things about Corfu... The house is impeccable: clean and very new and taken care of everything. And it has a spectacular view. It's actually a unit with 3 apartments  1 downstairs and 2 upstairs  but the feeling was to be alone. A perfect place to explore the island and a couple of minutes from one of its best beaches. Translated from Spanish  Show original
26361078,Sandra August 2018 The place was really very nice. Lucy has put a lot of effort into the many small details  so that you could only feel comfortable cantons. The view from the balcony is indescribable. The place is quietly located and you can really relax well. Pelekas is a great location if you want to explore the island by car. It is centrally located and you can get anywhere easily from there. Translated from German  Show original
26361078,Ιωαννης July 2018 The apartment was very clean and recently renovated! It gives you a sense of relaxation  just what you need for your vacation. There are thoughtful details that make a difference in all rooms. The bedroom exudes a sense of luxury and relaxation at the same time  while its balcony makes up for its incredible view ideal for enjoying the sunrise and the moon in the evening. It is located five minutes from the famous beach of Kontogialos and it is next to the beautiful and picturesque village of Peleka that is worth a visit. It is only fifteen minutes from the town of Cyprus. But above all  we would not have enjoyed the stay so much without Miss Lucie's useful advice that she has always been benevolent and willing to help us. Thanks so much for everything!

41161785,Simon October 2022 The location is absolutely fantastic and the cleanliness was aswell! great place to stay!
41161785,Lucy September 2022 Absolutely perfect location  above a beautiful beach and delicious restaurant and 5 minutes drive to lovely restaurants in Pelekas. Slightly tricky situation with the drainage from the shower and a cleaner comes to do the room each day (which would be great for other people but woke us up earlier than we would like!) but apart from that it was perfect.
41161785,Jessica June 2022 Beautiful place with very nice people :)
41161785,Sonia August 2021 Stunning place! we had the best two weeks in Yaliskari. The place is for people who like calm and remote places without too much tourist crowd. The apartment is very comfortable  it has all necessary equipment to make food for yourself  it was cleaned every other day  and from balcony you can see over the small bay and you can hear the sea. Right at the beach there is a Taverna with delicious seafood and other Greek specials- I recommend to try desserts. The beach is mostly sandy and when you enter the sea it gently gets deeper so it's also safe for kids or those who are not the best swimmers. Nikos was a great host  always ready to answer our questions. He helped us with difficulties to get around the island cause of lack of car. The whole crew in Taverna is very likeable and the place has good atmosphere. We recommend to rent a car or scooter at the airport because Pelekas and surroundings has steep roads and it might be hard to sightsee the island without any vehicles. The food shop is 20 min walking so is the Pelekas beach where you have more tavernas and cafes. overall one of the best holidays we have had. we would definitely go back.
41161785,Fulea June 2021 Great location  very remote  next to the beach of Yaliskari  25 min by car from Corfu Town  5 min by car to supermarket  Kontagialos beach and Pelekas village  20 min to Lidl Supermarket. You do need a car for everything else except Yaliskari Taverna and Yaliskari beach but the location is breathtaking  the apartment is very clean and has a clening service every other day. Great room from the terrace  great food at the Taverna  good beds and linings  clean towels provided. We had a great stay  thank you Nicos  we will sure be back next year.
41161785,Yuliya October 2020 I have been to a heaven))) Amazing views  secluded location full of corfian soul.
41161785,Camille January 2020 The host canceled this reservation 154 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41161785,Tanja July 2022 Beautiful studio  more modernly furnished than in the pictures. The view from the balcony is absolutely amazing. Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
41161785,Maria June 2022 Nikos place was a paradise for us. Tucked away in the countryside  away from the tourist crowds  overlooking the sea. The studio met our wishes. Good beds. Simple pantry. Air conditioning. Occasionally little or no water but that was quickly rectified. Nikos taveerne on the beach is a lovely place to sit with good food and friendly staff.  The place is difficult to reach  the road to it is bad. A private car is necessary. The short distance to the beach is steep and the beach itself is quite rocky. If you have difficulty walking  that can be drawbacks. For us  the benefits outweighed the downsides. We had a nice week there. Translated from Dutch  Show original
41161785,Jason July 2021 Excellent small accommodation  perfect for a couple  strategically located for visiting the entire island  and away from places of great tourist traffic. Wonderful sea view from the terrace  a very nice little beach 5 minutes walk with a nice taverna to eat a grilled fish (among other things). Cleaning was even done every day in the studio ! Communication with Nikos was easy  and directions were clear. Access road is a little difficult though  and the strict minimum dishes for the kitchen  but it's not a problem either. We'll be happy to go back! Translated from French  Show original
2949005,Dean July 2022 Waking up to these views was pleasing everyday. The rooms were comfortable  and the restaurant food was great both in taste and value for money. The family run business involved pleasant people especially Sophia who was super accommodating and always felt super approachable. Just a lovely person.  The beach nearby is beautiful and sandy with picturesque rocks on its edges. -More great views if you fancy the short climb.  I'd definitely revisit Pelekas and explore the area further using Bella Vista apartments as my base. Thank you guys xx
2949005,E Nicholas June 2022 A great little location for a few days and the owners Claudia and Sophia are very professional and helpful..Even when they are very busy they always make that personal touch of talking with the customer.  A little dated the rooms and water pressures could be fixed  but otherwise very good and a great place for a young family or a young couple.  I rarely write reviews but they deserve the thumbs up  Thank you also Sophia very much
2949005,Arttu July 2021 Super friendly and helpful staff that made our late night arrival as easy as possible. Our room was clean and had all the necessary things to make our stay comfortable. Nice balcony with great views to enjoy the sunset with a glass of wine. The place overall has great views as it is located up in the hill. They arranged a taxi shuttle for us from the airport and it was a good choice as it was dark when we arrived and the roads are narrow over there. We arranged cat rental by ourselves but it can be done with the help of the staff as well once you're there. We had a great time  the hotel restaurant is really good and the place itself is within a short walk distance from the beach. Good stuff!
2949005,Ivana July 2021 Nice place to stay  really close to the sea. Don't expect any parties in a neighborhood though. The area is perfect for families with small children. I recommend rooms on the first floor (better view  less humidity). Don't forget that tap water is not healthy.
2949005,Viktor June 2021 We had a very nice stay at Bella Vista. Claudia and her husband were very friendly and helpful as well as all of the people there. Sunsets were totally breathtaking and the room was great with a nice seaview. The food was amazing  either if it was dinner or breakfast. Alltogether  it was a wonderful stay!
2949005,Stranigg May 2019 Everything was great during our stay. The view is amazing  the staff is very friendly  kind and helpful and the breakfast is great too.
2949005,Eloise September 2017 We had a really great time in Bella vista  the rooms were very nice with a small kitchen and nice bathroom  the views were incredible and it was in a great location! Bella vista was a very short walk from pelekas beach which was nice and sandy with lovely beach bars and tavernas and sun beds it was also close to pelekas village which was up a very steep hill. It took about 25 minutes to walk up it which was very tiring but the next door hotel has a shuttle bus which we used which made it a lot more convenient! From there you can catch a bus into Corfu town for only €2.30 and from there you can access the whole island! Claudia was a great host giving us recommendations for what to do  helping organise transfers and helping us with how to get around the island! Everyon at Bella vista was so lovely  friendly and helpful and the restaurant served really nice home cooked corfiot food  would definitely recommend it to others and would love to come back and visit one day! Thank you :)
2949005,Aurélie May 2017 The view is absolutely amazing! Claudia and her husband were very kind and very helpful for our arrival because they arranged the transfert from the airport during the night and they Found a car for us. Claudia answers very quickly to the messages. The room was good  and the breakfast Nice.
2949005,Peter September 2016 We had a brilliant stay at Bella Vista!  Beautiful location and brilliant hosts! We will be back!!
2949005,Juliette August 2016 The Bella Vista is a very special place  with an amazing view and very kind hosts. The apartment was very clean  the possibility of parking the car very useful. We also enjoyed the delicious cuisine of the restaurant. The Bella Vista is also very well situated to go to the beach ok Pelekas and from the hotel there is one of the best sunsets we've ever seen! We clearly recommend Claudia as a host!
2949005,Nick May 2016 Claudia is a wonderful hostess! She immediately made us feel welcome and started our stay off with complementary drinks. Our room was fabulous  and overall Bella Vista is a wonderful place to stay; truly a hidden gem! Claudia was also extremely helpful as far as recommending various places on the island to visit; taking time out of her busy schedule to give us great detail on various places of interest
2949005,Desiree J. August 2015 Really nice place  amazing view  great and super delicious food! Claudia and her family are so helpful  that you feel like a family member. Highly recommendable!! We love this place!!!
2949005,Valentin August 2015 Very good place  the staff is very Nice and hepfull  and I recommend to eat the traditional food of Claudia's family ! Thank you for the trip Claudia
2949005,Mareike June 2022 Claudia is an excellent cook and Sophie is such a lovely host. Souflaki and Moussaka are highly recommended :) But not only the food but the whole ambience is great. The view outweighs everything. Those who live there have no worries and can unwind their soul. The view of the ocean is really beautiful and very romantic at sunset. The Mythos beer tastes great and the bay within walking distance has clear water and we didn't even need to rent a car and explore the area as it was a respite to have breakfast in the Bella Vista  bathe in the bay and then have a glass of wine or beer and dinner in the evening. Pure relaxation! I'm sure we'll be back. Translated from German  Show original
2949005,Jannik June 2021 We stayed a total of 7 nights at Bella Vista and had a lovely time. Despite the situation (corona)  everyone has made a lot of effort to ensure a great stay under these conditions. If you are looking for a quiet place with good value for money  Claudia  Sophia & Co. is the place to be. Everyone is super nice and warm  the location is very nice and the sandy beach close and clean. The only small uncomfortable shortcoming was the mattress and the pillows.

6171681,Stefano August 2018 Beautifull sea view and sun set!!
6171681,Jasmine June 2017 The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6171681,Francesco September 2022 Apartment with a really lovely view at the foot of Pelekas  you will not only feel like a guest but part of the family  Spyros' parents are very kind and helpful: they gave us a bottle of wine they produced  offered an aperitif in the garden with sea view of the apartment  provided disinfectant for an injury and booked the taxi for the return. They don't speak Italian  and to be honest  they speak little in English  but they understand each other. This lack of it is filled with Spyros very available in chat and other family members who during the week have met and made sure that we were doing well. The family is also made up of adorable animals that have brought us along  including Mortis  a very adorable kitten  and Nala  a very friendly puppy. They also cleaned (accurately and impeccably) our room twice during the week  even though it was not included in the price we paid. The house is just the right size  bright bathroom and with a small window  living kitchen with everything you need to cook (toaster  kettle  oven  stove  sink  etc.)  bedroom with double bed very comfortable and a very large balcony with a wooden table where we ate with a magnificent view.  The apartment is at the end of the street of Kontogialos  on the right going down from Pelekas and on the street you will find the only Supermarket in the area (also well stocked for us discerning Italians: there is pasta  pesto and sauce ready by Barilla) and a wall with the writing Rolling Stones  here you have to go up. You'll find a bar we recommend for its very nice manager who knows how to entertain you in his own way. The beach  both free and equipped  is 200 meters away  going down a couple of descents. We recommend renting a car to visit nearby beaches  such as Palaiokastritsa and the village of Corfu old town  with its two Venetian fortresses. Alternatively  a 26-minute walk away  there is Pelekas with many bars and restaurants  but also the bus stop line 11 that will take you to Corfu old town in 30 minutes  from here in addition to visiting Corfu you can change lines and reach the other places on the island.  Thank you very much Spyros and his family for making us feel at home in their corner of paradise where we will definitely return  sooner or later. We highly recommend everyone to consider this apartment. Show more Translated from Italian  Show original

49591820,Morena July 2022 We are a family of 4 and we really enjoyed our stay in Ben’s apartment! Super clean and really well decorated with beautiful design furniture  comfortable beds and everything you’d need as kitchen appliances  tv with Netflix  wifi speakers. Great sea view from the balcony and the rooms at the first floor. Pelekas is a nice small village with tavernas and shops at hand and a good location to visit the island  20 min by car from the airport and from sandy beaches on the West coast. Ben has always been very responsive before and during our vacation and ready to fulfill all our requests! We fully recommend!
49591820,Laszlo July 2022 Ben’s apartment in Pelekas is an absolute rare find in Corfu. The apartment is beautiful  the view is mind blowing and Pelekas is such a cool village with easy access to the greatest beaches in Corfu. The styling of the apartment is immaculate with the highest level of attention to details. Ben is a fantastic host  he was super responsive  he welcomed us with amazing local biscuits  he helped us with car hire and gave us some great recommendations for eating out in the neighbourhood. I simply couldn’t recommend him more. This is one of the best airbnbs that you can find on the island.
49591820,Rupert May 2022 Thx for everything Ben. My son and me had a great time at your really nice place. Top appartement  really nice view to the sea  everything new  clean  well equiped  tastfully furnited. Close to nice beaches of the west-cost. Late check-in as well as check-out was also no problem. In short 👌🏽
49591820,Victoria August 2021 We had a wonderful time staying at this beautiful apartment overlooking the Mediterranean and enjoyed many breathtaking sunsets from the beautiful balcony. The interior design of this Airbnb is stunning and unlike any I have stayed in thus far  selected natural materials are beautifully combined reflecting a traditional  yet modern Corfiot style that made us feel relaxed and at home. Ben and Thomas were incredibly helpful sharing tips about the area and going the extra mile  helping us organise a rental car last minute. Thanks for everything  we’ll be back!
49591820,Jale August 2022 Everything was just absolutely wonderful!  First of all  I would like to thank Ben and his wife for the beautiful surprise for our honeymoon. It's very successful✨.

23113588,Miriam June 2022 We had a wonderful time on Corfu. The flat was very clean  functionally furnished (especially the fly screens on all the windows are worth their weight in gold!) and above all has a wonderful view over the bay. During the week  the towels were changed several times  the bed linen was changed and the flat was cleaned. We liked the beach very much and it is only a few steps away. We felt very comfortable and would definitely recommend the accommodation! Thank you for everything!
23113588,Anna October 2021 Very nice place and very friendly and hardworking hosts. The apartment is well-equipped and has a well-thought-out layout. The balcony overlooking the bay and the beach is a great place to relax. To get here  it is worth borrowing a car at the airport in Corfu to move freely around the island. There are many places worth seeing next to the nearest beach.
23113588,Shero July 2021 Super great accommodation! Hosts are very kind a caring. This is definitely a superhost  but without a “superhost” badge for now :) So  hurry up and book!

580598,"Victor September 2022 After reading all the positive reviews we were very excited about staying here. Unfortunately the reviews did not match our experience!  The positives: good communication although all by text/email as the host stays on the mainland  the pool is a good size  the location is good (car needed) to easily explore the island  lovely welcome pack.  The negatives: the garden is barren scrubland with no flowers or plants and no usable outside space except up at the pool - the other identical villas all have beautiful gardens. You will notice that there are no pictures of the garden in the listing - that will be the reason. It looked like the villa flooded in the rainy season as the bed and sofa were perched up on blocks and long grass had grown around the main entrance! The pool is dug into the hillside and sits up from the house. As such there is a 2 metre drop on one side that isn't protected by any barrier. This makes it very unsafe for children (and adults). The path to the pool is terrible and difficult to navigate as it consists of random placement of stepping stones - slippery when wet! The inside space is comfortable enough but is quite ""tired"" and neglected. Thankfully we had a car and could escape to beautiful countryside and beaches which were stunning.  The frustrating thing about this villa is that the a little bit money spent on it would transform it. Evidence of this is clear to see with the beautiful villas next door!  Corfu is beautiful - this villa is not! Show more Response from Dimitra September 2022 Dear Victor As you seemed not satisfied day one we had proposed to cancel and refund. You didnt. Remarks from guests are a chance for us to improve. Usually. This is not the case. "".The pool is not safe for adults? The rocks are slippery when its raining? Difficult to navigate?"" I am afraid this is a case of ""The grass is greener on the other side of the fence"" so for us there is not much to say. Previous reviews is the answer Thank you Show more"
580598,Helen August 2022 We had a wonderful stay in this gorgeous villa   it is perfect for all your self catering needs. The outside seating and pool are fantastic. The house is much larger than the photos suggest and very cool with high ceilings. The welcome package of food and drink was very much appreciated and very generous. It was also great to be able to wash clothes and use the dish washer just like we would at home as well as watch a couple of movies on the big tv through our Netflix account which the kids appreciated. The villa is in a lovely quiet location but with a car we visited some wonderful locations such as Agios gordios  limni beach  yaliskari  corfu town and a must if you have children or even if you don’t - aqualand water park which is 4 mins drive away. We also went to Porto Timoni early one morning - a bit further to drive but well worth it if you get there early. Dimitra was a wonderful host and communication was very quick and helpful every time. A truly understanding and lovely host. Thanks for a wonderful holiday.
580598,James August 2022 Everything was perfect  thank you !
580598,Jo July 2022 We had a lovely week at Dimitra’s place  with everything we could need for a family of four. The villa is very secluded but only a 5-minute drive from a lovely shop and 10 minutes to the restaurants of Pelekas. The private pool was perfect for our use and the villa itself was very comfortable and a little bigger than the pictures suggest. Dimitra provided a lovely welcome package which was much appreciated. If we come back to Corfu we would definitely stay here again.
580598,Mihai September 2021 The villa is in a quiet place  away from the crowded city and very close to Pelekas beach (5 mins by car). The rooms were clean and so was the pool. The kitchen is well equipped if interested in cooking. We had a small problem with the bathroom  but it was rapidly solved. We really enjoyed our week in Corfu! Thanks again  Dimitra!
580598,Daryl September 2021 We had a lovely family holiday in Dimitra's house which is very comfortable and relaxing. The pool is lovely and a great size for swimming  it's really clean and a maintenance guy every few days. There is a lively outside veranda where we spent alot of time  the kitchen is well equipped and Dimitra is a lovely host who responded quickly to any queries we had. We would really recommend this house  it's close to Corfu town and a number of really nice beaches.
580598,Theodor July 2021 We enjoyed our holiday at Dimitras Place. The house has all you need. The beds are good and it’s quiet. We loved the pool! It’s like a pool has to be :-) The house is very well located. You find a lot of good restaurants and beautiful beaches only a few minutes away. And thank you to Dimitra she is a very pleasant and well organized host. We got all the information in the right time and some good tips.
580598,Christina August 2020 If you are looking for a nice villa with a private pool  look no further. Villa and pool are surrounded by Olive trees and sitting by the pool is so relaxing that we sat there having coffee in the mornings and wine in the evenings. We spent 9 days at the villa and it felt so good to be there that we barely had the need to visit all the beautiful beaches in Corfu😉. The villa is about 3 km from the small village Pelekas where the locals mingle with the tourists  where you can eat in a nice tavern while looking at the sun setting into the ocean or have a drink at a small bar. We strongly recommend this villa!
580598,Fabian July 2020 We had a perfect stay at Dimitra´s house. Dimitra and Doris responded immediately to any requests. The pool of course was the main attraction for our children  it was in fact bigger than we thought. Everything you need and very close to the most beautiful beaches of Corfu.
580598,Christina August 2018 A lovely villa and pool. We had a fab week here. The villa has everything you need for a holiday  good basics  washing powder  even buckets and spades for the kids. Dimitra was very helpful. We loved hanging out by the pool  it's a lovely setting with olive trees all around. The covered veranda is perfect for eating out of the sun and sitting out in the evenings listening to the birds. The villa's central location makes it very easy to explore the island and we loved the local Pelekas beach which was great for our young kids. Great value for money we would definitely recommend this villa.
580598,Marcel July 2018 We had a really nice stay at villa Pelekas and we recommend this place.

It is the best equipped house we have ever stayed in  including things like coffee  bin bags  laundry detergent etc. which makes a difference. The pool is delightful and very clean  as is the rest of the house. Dimitra and Thanassis are very kind hosts  communication is excellent.
580598,Alessandra July 2017 Ideal accomodation for those looking for peace and tranquillity but at the same time want to reach in no time magnificient places  beaches  tavernas.
580598,Xiaoqin July 2017 We had a really good time at the house of Dimitra. The house and the pool are very clean. When we had a question or a problem we always get a quick response of Dimitra. The location was perfect for us  to Corfu Town you need only 20 to 30 minutes and to the best beach of the island 10 minutes.
580598,Franz July 2016 Meeting to get the keys was on time  perfectly planned  inside the house its nicely furnished  simple  nice floors  good mattresses. Outside plenty opportunities to find shade or sun  nice pool  clean  the walkway inbetween house and pool could be improved.
580598,Jan Erik August 2014 An fantastic house nearby the beaches of Pelekas  Glifada and mirthisiossis beach in an quiet area. The house is clean  nice interiour and and swimmingpool. We will come back..
580598,Coralie July 2022 Very nice  fully equipped house  quiet surrounded by olive trees and with a large pool. The owner is very communicative and attentive. The place is ideal for discovering the island  beautiful beaches just 10 minutes drive away  and about twenty minutes from Corfu old town  very pleasant for walking in the evening. We stayed for 15 days and are delighted  looking forward to returning next summer! Translated from French  Show original
580598,Gianluca June 2022 Beautiful villa in an excellent location to see the island. away from the chaos  it enjoys a beautiful swimming pool for exclusive use. also in seven days of stay  a pool cleaning staff came twice to clean and control it. we found food and drinks on our arrival. nearby there are two great tavernas where you can have lunch and dinner outdoors. a minute's drive away there is a small supermarket. There are 10 minutes by car from the beautiful beaches. Recommended for those like us with children Translated from Italian  Show original
580598,Ellen August 2021 The location is great  you are very central and can take many excursions from there by car. The house would have to be renewed in a few places and also maintained more  some also fits well as  for example  the beds have been well located. The neighbors in the adjacent houses can also be clearly heard with a pool  but for us it was no problem  as our children are already a little bigger. Translated from German  Show original
580598,Marco August 2020 Dimitra's place is exactly as described on the website. Perfectly located to reach all the most beautiful beaches on the island   it is furnished in a simple but elegant way  and is equipped with all the comforts you need  including kitchen accessories. Two spacious bedrooms make the house a great solution for a family of 4. We spent 12 days in August for the post lockdown  with the low tourist traffic. It is  of course  a car  but in 5 minutes you can reach all the services and the nearest beaches (Glyfada  Kontogialos) and in 40 minutes those of the north east coast (Nisaki Kalami) or to the south ( Issos) instead of the north west (Paradise beach in Palaiokastisa  Agios Georgis). Corfu is 20 minutes away. The house has  of course  the pool surrounded by olive trees   where you can relax after a day at sea. Dimitra  although physically absent  has contacted us several times to verify any needs  leaving a reference on the place (however only called on the first day to find the house - we are in the countryside and the coordinates on Google are not very accurate). In short  the house is definitely recommended . Translated from Italian  Show original
580598,Alex August 2019 We really enjoyed our stay at Dimitra's place. The house was as advertised and the location of the house is perfect for both visiting the island and going to the beach. Dimitra is very considerate and responsive. We recommend this property. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Veronique August 2019 Very clean villa as described. Close to several beautiful beaches and tourist places while being quiet . The hosts were at our disposal   great stay. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Bérengère September 2018 A magnificent stay spent in this peaceful haven amid olive trees ! The house is full of charm  very well equipped (comfortable bedding  dishwasher  hairdryer  very clean pool  deckchair  mosquito repellent plugs...) and very clean. Dimitra was available and gave us valuable advice before and during our trip  thank you. Small touches (fresh water bottles  fruit) were waiting for us when we arrived. I highly recommend this rental !!! Translated from French  Show original
580598,Jérôme August 2018 Perfect location. Private full size pool. There is nothing missing in the house. The owners were at our disposal and we were very responsive in their responses to our messages. Accommodation to be recommended. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Marc July 2018 Very well-equipped house with a pool and an unbeatable environment ideal for a family. The fact that the pool is a bit separate from the house is very positive for families with small children  as the security is greater and you have some peace of mind. Although we didn't have an in-person interaction at all times  we felt very welcome and the communication was very quick and excellent. They left us a welcome treat and equipped the house with things for the kids. We highly recommend this place to other families. Translated from Catalan  Show original
580598,Oleh June 2018 What can I say.... beautiful villa surrounded by nature with all the comforts. The private pool in the middle of the olive trees makes it unique! Dimitra was always very available for any need. I would highly recommend and we will definitely be back Translated from Italian  Show original Response from Dimitra June 2018 I am so happy that you have good time in a strange weather conditions and you enjoyed the house! I really hope to see you again!
580598,Luc August 2017 Friendly welcome. Exact and precious contact before arrival. Thanks for everything. Translated from French  Show original
580598,Melanie July 2016 Thank you for the lovely stay in Pelekas! The villa is very cozy  spacious  clean and well equipped. Two separate bedrooms  ideal for a family of 4 or even friendly couples. Dimitra's sister Mary guided us to the house and was available to us during our stay. The location is perfect for exploring the area – Corfu town and many beautiful beaches are nearby. Translated from German  Show original
580598,Sophie July 2015 We spent 3 very pleasant weeks in this accommodation  ideally located  quiet  in a green setting away from all the hustle and bustle. However  the village of Pelekas and its beaches are within a 5-minute drive. The house is very nice  convenient and fresh. The pool is quite large and well maintained sinceapool-boy comes to clean it three times a week. Finally  Dimitra welcomed us warmly and even prepared local specialties for us in the fridge. We highly recommend this property ! Translated from French  Show original
12876298,Neil July 2022 Beautiful villa  as well described. Everything works well and location is superb.
12876298,Henry August 2017 Lovely villa  great pool  very quiet and scenic location with incredible view. Would definitely recommend to others and stay again. Guest should be aware that there is No wifi though and phone signal is very limited.
12876298,Anne August 2016 Villa Phoebe is lovely  very well equipped and spacious and I think exceeded all our expectations. The rooms were beautifully prepared  the pool a great size  and that lovely view... All in all the setting for an excellent family holiday. Would like to have stayed longer!
12876298,Joyce July 2017 beautiful house with 3 shower rooms  stunning views  the only downside: the access path ( and no internet and little phone) Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Oumaima October 2022 Don’t think twice and book here!!!! It was the best experience I ´ve ever had. You will never meet a kinder person than Debbie 🥰 It was so comfy to sleep in the tente  I met amazing people  the beaches and the views near the place are breathtaking♥️
50701095,Cornelia October 2022 Staying at Debbie's oasis was the best  I enjoyed my time there very much. sleeping in the hanging tent was great and adventures  the view from the treehouse is amazing  the fig jam is delicious and Debbie is just a perfect host.She is warm and friendly and helped me a lot.I totally recommend staying at that little piece of paradise.
50701095,Mirren September 2022 10/10 stay! Debbie is amazing  so kind and helpful. It was such a fun experience staying in the suspended tent  waking up under the trees and sun every morning - and very comfy with nice blankets and pillows. I won’t forget the experience ❤️
50701095,Dawid September 2022 I have booked many different places through airbnb but this one is by far my favourite. Imagine a quiet place in the woods with beach and town nearby and truly one of a kind host - Debbie  who is someone who you instantly love - warm  sweet and funny. You feel at home immediately. This place is really a oasis where you can relax and recharge your batteries. It is so well thought out  Debbie takes care of every detail so you really have absolutely everything you may need and more. I can’t imagine a better place for vacation <3
50701095,Anna August 2022 Debbie is a wonderful host  very accommodating and friendly. The site is a perfect break from citylife!
50701095,Lara August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay at Debbie's. She a lovely host and really cares for her guests. I hope we can come back soon!!!
50701095,Kristian August 2022 this place would be perfect for you if you somehow tired of urban life no stress here  only joyful and pleasures! Debbie is an amazing lady with many creative ideas  you can ask her anything if you have further questions about Corfu .Definitely will come back one day!
50701095,Klaudia July 2022 We spend there amazing time. Owners are very nice  lovely and so helpfully!
50701095,Julius July 2022 We had a very nice stay! Would recommend it to anyone looking for something relaxed and out-of-the-box. You can really tell it's a very loved place and we met some great people. You need to have a scooter to get around though. There were many mosquitoes though which was annoying and the scooter rental was very difficult for us personally.
50701095,Marie July 2022 Our stay at this little paradise was more than convincing: Waking up under a roof of leaves to the sounds of birds made our days. We stayed in the hanging tent which was a little adventure  definitely worth it. Debbie & Nicholas were such lovely hosts who genuinely cared for our well-being. Debbie even brought self made banana bread & Baklava to the campsite for us. We didn’t rent a scooter or a car so we walked down to the beach which is fine if you don’t mind walking; the way up can be very hot  especially when the sun is high up. We will be back but next time we’ll probably rent a scooter. We totally recommend this place if you like being in the nature & if you want something different from a cooled down hotel room. Thank you again for everything!
50701095,Rahul July 2022 Debbie was great and full of energy and the camping or glamping place was very well created by her and the family with many tine details.  We loved our stay and nearby beaches. Especially the kitchen walls and homemade wine and etc.  Hope to visit again.
50701095,Anja July 2022 Such an amazing place ! Everything is make to feel you well  Debbie is a lovely host with so much attention ! We take time to relax and be out of the dailylife time ! thanks a lot !
50701095,Lucy June 2022 This site is amazing  we stayed in the suspended tent which was surprisingly comfortable. The hosts are very quick and helpful when responding to queries and really go above and beyond to make the stay memorable! would highly recommend.
50701095,Michael June 2022 It was a pleasure to stay at this camping site. Debbie  Nicholas and Tony are very friendly hosts and they tried to help us from the first second we arrived. We were very excited because all the positive reviews and they are non-exaggerated. This is a Beautiful place and everybody have to stay at the camping site.
50701095,Laura May 2022 This place is indescribable! We enjoyed our stay there so much  it’s just the most beautiful place :) Debbie and all her family were so kind and hostile  we really felt more than welcome and could ask anything at anytime (bus schedules  restaurant recommendations  etc.). They even offered us help for transportation. We also loved the location of the place  it was really calm but still easy to reach (we arrived by bus) and had nice beaches and hiking paths close to it!
50701095,Andreas October 2021 Thanks to Debbie  Tony and Nicholas for the great experience that is giving when staying at their AirBnB glamping site.  Very helpful and kind people!!!!!!
50701095,Jan September 2021 I enjoyed my stay with Debbie and tony’s place very much. They are such kind people  helpful in anyway  and it is a lovely place if you love nature and just want some peace. I enjoyed every second I was there and I’ll be back again within a blink of an eye. If you love nature this is his place to go. There’s a lovely town nearby where you can get what you need. However I cannot recommend the guy Who rent scooters in the small village it’s better to rent one at the airport or in the city. Thank you for letting me stay at your wonderful place.
50701095,Leonie September 2021 It was soo amazing to stay at the Campingsite in Pelekas. Debbie and Tony are such very lovely and helpful people! All in all it was an awesome trip. Thank you so much for everything. We will definitely come back!
50701095,Sarah September 2021 Amazing place and Debbie and Toni were so so warm and welcoming. Had a great chat on the treehouse with Debbie and it was lovely. We had an issue with the tent but they made sure to make up for it and help us out. Great communication and would definitely recommend.
50701095,Jonas September 2021 Our stay in the camping was an absolutely wonderful experience. The owner Debbie is a wonderful person who has created a beautiful space in the middle of nature for us to really relax and get away from the stress and worries of life. So much care and attention to detail went into making this place. Is everything perfect? Of course not  it's camping not a 5 star hotel. There can be bugs  noise from animals at night  occasional footsteps of other guests or the water stops working for a while. But the joy of waking up in nature with views on the bay  having an early coffee in the watch tower and the smell of pines  just let's you forget your worries and enjoy the moment. It's really an oasis  relaxing and adventurous at the same time. We will make sure to come back to this wonderful place when we visit Corfu again.
50701095,Lisa August 2021 Get ready for a wonderful and fullfilling experience of a beautiful location with the best view of the coast of the west  beautiful beaches and last but definitely not least the best host I have ever met! This place is full of positive energy and there is love in every detail! Everything was beyond perfect and the camping site is something very special in the best way. Debbie is so caring and she is having the best tips about the Island and is always there if you need her! I had the warmest welcome ever!
50701095,Ebra August 2021 Debbie‘s place was like piece of paradise . Very safe   comfortable  20 minutes walking to the most beautiful beach in Corfu. Debbie answers very quickly and take care of the guest We were sad that we had to leave   we will come again Highly recommended the place  Thank you Debbie
50701095,Maciek August 2021 Debbie is a great person and truly takes care of their guests. The place is one of a kind and there's everything you need on a camping and even more. The location is pretty good also - the beaches and the nearby town Pelekas are lovely. Will recommend the Olive Garden Glamping to all of my friends going to Corfu :)
50701095,Vos August 2021 first of all   i could not eveR imagine that this place exists in corfu of 2021. This was the place i was searching for without knowing it. Living inside -pure nature- for some days is maybe the best medicine for our souls we all have to found our inner self because we are in danger to lost. Debbie & tony offers you the chance to make it possible  alongside to explore the very very beautiful island of corfu. Highly and totally recommended  im sure that i will come back to this magic -fairytale- place.. Response from Deborah Anne August 2021 Thank you Nickolas! You put into words exactly what Tony and I were hoping to offer. I am happy you found peace!
50701095,Maria August 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Debbie’s site. The view was breathtaking and the facilities were perfect. Debbie herself was an exceptional host who went out of her way daily to accommodate us. I would recommend to anyone who wants to take a step back and trek through the mountains to some really beautiful beaches!
50701095,Johannes August 2021 It was a very nice site  communication was perfect and very nice owners!! Best recommendations for places/restaurants/bars from Debbie about all the island :) Best wishes and hope to see you again!!
50701095,Benjamin August 2021 The place is very nice  and Tony and Debbie are very lovely  will go again to see them
50701095,Aylin July 2021 We could not have chosen a better place for our stay on Corfu Island! We're definitely coming back  Debbie and Tony are the loveliest hosts one can hope for and the Camp they built is so comfortable and lovely. It has a proper kitchen  shower and toilet  we really didn't miss anything. If you're staying in Pelekas or on Corfu in general I would definitely recommend renting a car or scooter as the way down to the beach is really steep and quite far. The view up from the camp however is amazing! We would have loved to stay longer and would recommend it to anyone visiting the island!
50701095,Maria October 2022 The place is great for relaxing  it's super quiet  you can almost only hear the sea. Sitting on one of the cozy homemade benches  closing your eyes and enjoying the tranquility is in itself very healing. Because the area is already so relaxing  it can be hard to move to the sea  but that doesn't matter. You can slow down  read  think and really come to rest here (probably depends on the fellow residents  but I was lucky :)). The nearest beach (Kontagialos) is a 20-minute walk downhill and back about 30 minutes uphill. In the village  where there is a supermarket  a few restaurants  cafes  two bakeries and a souvenir shop and a very nice jewelry shop of an artist  you walk about 10-15 minutes uphill. Due to the reviews here  I had thought of renting a scooter or a car  but I did not find it necessary on site.  All the sleeping places have a small table and seating and the hanging tent also includes a large plastic chest in which I could store my luggage and also organize something. This made the camping experience extremely comfortable.  Debbie and Niko have made sure everything is in order at Glamping every day and have repeatedly emphasized their availability. I also liked that the stay allowed me to learn a little about the Corfu and the local culture and situation  including because the family-owned property already has a long history to the Ottoman Empire. Debbie also provided us with rosé daily from friends from Lefkas or brought us a vegetarian dish from her mother-in-law. Mega was also nice that Debbie picked me up at the bus stop in Moucha on my arrival with my heavy backpack. You really try to make a comfortable stay here and offer opportunities for exchange without any hassle. Loved it.  As relaxing and wonderful as this place was during the day  it might still be important for solo travelers or anxious people to mention that at night the wildlife is steadily audible and you can also hear an animal under or next to you or a little rustling. Unfortunately  this was a bit difficult for me personally  so falling asleep was not so easy. This is not a criticism of the accommodation  but rather an indication for those who might be so important.  I thank you for this wonderful stay and can recommend this oasis to everyone!

50701095,Victor September 2022 It was wonderful! I think Debbie is the best host I've ever had! She was very available to answer any questions I had  she picked me up by car when I arrived to make my journey easier  and even drove me on the day of departure  awesome! The accommodation is beautiful  in the middle of the forest  far from everything  with a great view. I hope to return longer one day so I can have time to enjoy the place. Thanks again for everything  and see you again! Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Carole August 2022 Great peaceful place Away from the crowds A great sea view from the cabin Close to village even on foot Relaxxxx order I would highly recommend it. Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Veronika August 2022 Absolute highlight for adventurers! We had spent 3 nights in the hammock (neither mosquitoes 🦟 nor other animals had a chance against the net) Debbie is just a very gracious person and the heart and soul of this haven of rest. ❤️Thank you very much for these wonderful moments and the great excursion tips. Translated from German  Show original
50701095,Elise June 2022 Beautiful location in the middle of the forest with beautiful sea views. Solar power is used to heat up the water and for electricity. If you are lovers of unusual and ecology don't miss out on this place. In addition  Debbie is very welcoming and available  we have everything we need. Translated from French  Show original
50701095,Sonja June 2022 Simply wonderful! The place is in the olive trees not far from the small village of Pelakas. We had a rental car with which we drove the steep paths to the different beaches. We walked about 15 minutes to the village in the evening.  We had the tree tent no. 3 which was stretched between three trees and is right next to the viewing platform. Totally cool. A nice contrast to other hotel complexes. The common areas (kitchen and bathroom) were always clean and lovingly furnished.  Debbie was always available and responded immediately. Everything was so great and loving. Debbie even brought homemade baklava or utensils for the bathroom in the meantime. Their mosquito spray was worth its weight in gold.  Everything was perfect! :) Translated from German  Show original
50701095,Fabian September 2021 Living at the camp for a few days was an unparalleled experience. My girlfriend and I loved it! Debbie is an incredible host and took care of everything  gave us great tips and was always there for us. She is such a great person! We put them right in our heart. The sleeping arrangements themselves are great and there are great beaches  restaurants and views in the area. We loved living here and my expectations were exceeded. Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Thomas October 2022 Awesome place  all the beaches are close by and there are plenty of nice hikes around. The fridge even had some supplies when we arrived! Home away from home  would love to be back
1690099,Aileen September 2022 Stavros is the perfect host! We had a wonderful week. The studio is clean  ideally located near the beach and has everything you need including a stocked fridge. Stavros even kindly collected us at the airport. We will definitely be back!
1690099,Claudia August 2022 Our stay was absolutely amazing! Stavros is beyond accommodating and did everything to make us feel at home. Definitely a super-host! We would love to return. There are two beaches within walking distance  as well as an easy bus system to get to corfu town. Very nice tranquil location!
1690099,Izabela July 2022 Stavros was a great host as always  very nice and helpful. The studio is situated in a quiet place for people who appreciate nature and privacy. We will come back for sure 😁
1690099,Georg June 2022 very quiet location  wonderful beach within walking distance. also a small supermarket and some restaurants are nearby. had a car and that can't hurt if you want to see more of the island. overall I enjoyed staying at Stravos.
1690099,Kate June 2022 Thank you Stavros for a great place to stay on our third trip to this area of Corfu. It was clean  quiet  comfortable  well equipped  and a pretty garden. Lovely beaches  and restaurants. Local shop nearby. Bus stop nearby to Ermones and Glifada and all stops to Corfu Town including Aqualand. Stavros even left provisions in the fridge for us too. Thank you.
1690099,Friederike May 2022 If you wanna spent a really relaxing and conformable time on corfu stay at Stavros beautiful studio in the middle of a beautiful nature close to a nice little beach. Stavros is an amazing hoste and will have a really great time.
1690099,Kurt October 2021 Stavros is a very caring and helpful host  and the house was very clean. We also enjoyed that a little start package of food and some wine was ready for us. The only drawback is that only a little sun reaches the garden in the low season (late October).
1690099,Lea September 2021 Really cute apartment in the nature. Stavros is a super friendly host and did a great job. Unfortunately in the ad there is no information about the direct neighboor. Its two apatments attached to each other so on the terrace you are sitting 2 meters away from your neighboor. I think thats an important Information if you rent a quiet studio in the nature. 4/5
1690099,Tim September 2021 Another wonderful stay. I never stay at the same place. Except here! Wonderful hospitality from Stavros and great location for walking and hiking to different beaches and interesting places. Everything was perfect and even better WiFi this time. Thanks Stavros
1690099,Alexander July 2021 An amazing location. Stavros is a fantastic host in everyway.
1690099,Martijn July 2021 Stavros’s studio is really amazing. It is on walking distance to two great beaches and two great restaurants. The studio itself has everything you need. Because it is quite centrally located you can basically go anywhere in Corfu. Stavros helped us renting a car and was always there to help! Overall we had a great holiday!
1690099,Niall July 2021 Really prime location in a lovely quiet area close to nature. The apartment has everything you’ll need from great wifi  air conditioning and cooking facilities. The host (Stravos) went all out to make sure we had everything we needed and was always at hand to answer questions or help out. This was the best AirBnB experience I’ve ever had personally. Can’t recommend this place enough and the fact that its right beside one of the best beaches in Corfu is a massive plus.
1690099,Rebecca Alper October 2020 This was perfect for two of us looking for a relaxed  public transport accessible holiday away from the crowds. We swam in the sea every day and hiked a lot. Even out of season there was plenty to do  and we hiked to the surrounding towns to visit restaurants. Stavros was an amazing host  checking in with us to check we had everything we needed  ensuring we understood where to catch the bus  and providing extra towels half way through our stay. Amazing value and a fantastic holiday. Thank you Stavros.
1690099,Kate October 2020 A very simple place which I loved. Really quiet and just a short walk to the beach (nudist) I loved it. The cooking facilities were unusual. The two hot plates were integral in a 1970’s (?) unit with sink and fridge with slightly fragile Tap on the sink. It was ok cooking for two for two nights but wouldn’t be easy for a family. Another side light would be a good addition to the place. We didn’t get sun in the mornings (in October not sure about rest of the day)!So it was a bit dark but the birdsong made up for this. We enjoyed staying there.
1690099,Stephanie October 2020 Truly exceptional vacation at Stavros' place. Communication beforehand was very fast and easy. At arrival the place was explained to us  we were given a few things to eat and great tips for our vacation on the island. The place was tidy and clean  we had no worries  Stavros was always available. The place is close to a shop  restaurants (great food and prices) and the beach. All in all it was the perfect place to relax and lovely to meet Stavros
1690099,Ronja September 2020 Very nice location near by the sea. Stavros is a very nice and helpful host! Everything was perfect and I will surly come back. Response from Stavros September 2020 Ronja you're always welcome would be a pleasure !!!
1690099,Tomas September 2020 We spend 14days in this studo and it was perfect  location is best i can imagine on Corfu  really calm area  all you need you have available. the closest beach is magic (one of the most beautiful in Corfu). Stavros is available to support you any time. It is definetelly worth to book.
1690099,"Mirka September 2020 The studio was perfect  all what we needed. It's ""in the middle of nowhere"" but still you can see 3 beaches by ""longer"" walk  beautiful places and you can find your spot away from the crowds. The studio is clean  communication with Stavros very nice  great place for a relaxing or active holiday. Highly recommended :) Thank you Stavros :)"
1690099,Petr August 2020 We truly appreciate all that Stavros offered to us - at first picking us up at the airport  then a fridge full of food  amazing studio!! with all the new furniture  garden  good equipment. Nice for a couple  but also for a group of friends or a family. Next and mainly - Stavros! Easy-going person who gave us many useful tips  had a talk with us  always smiling and making jokes. And the location was really good as well. Summarizing it -> perfect  thanks.
1690099,Anixa August 2020 Amazing! Stavros is a superhost! He is super nice and helpful.The studio is very clean and quiet and super close to one of the most beautiful beaches of the island. We will repeat for sure. Thank you Stavros!
1690099,Izabela July 2020 The studio is located in a very good place for people who appreciate nature and privacy  the studio has everything you need. Stavros is a great host that takes care of every detail. I highly recommend this place
1690099,Stephan July 2020 We had amazing days at Stavros‘s place. He warmly welcomed us and helped us with everything. The beach close to his place is amazing and has a really calm vibe going on! Definitely a place you should go to if you’re interested in a peaceful and relaxing holiday trip!
1690099,Paula October 2019 Stavros' place was recommended by some friends who have been there three times and it did not disappoint us; we had a lovely stay in a beautiful area .... Stavros was a super host who could not have done more to be helpful and kept in contact with us during our stay. In particular he collected us from the airport and returned us there (which got our holiday off to a good start). A welcome pack of good  local food was waiting for us when we arrived and it is helpful if Stavros knows if you are vegetarian or vegan. The studio is quiet and in a natural setting. Stavros has provided everything you might need. He also organised a hire car for us which was a lot cheaper than airport car hire. A local bus at the end of the road takes you to Corfu town. The local Myrtiotissa beach is a short walk away and very beautiful; we had some wonderful swims there. It is a steep walk down and back up. There are many steep hikes in Corfu so if you are an older person like I am  I would recommend bringing a hiking stick; you will certainly feel fitter by the end of it!
1690099,Dario October 2019 The studio's location is great and it has everything you need. Shopping and the beach are nearby. Stavros is a super nice host and communication worked perfectly  before and during our stay. We can warmly recommend the place!
1690099,Louise September 2019 Excellent place to stay  especially for those that want to be in a chill peaceful place away from the general tourists. Stavros was great! We were delayed~7 hours and he still met us on arrival. Fridge stocked with some food and beer  a warm welcome with local tips. What more could you ask for?
1690099,Elvis August 2019 11 out of 10! That's airbnb perfection!
1690099,Rui August 2019 Stavros is a dream host. Always happy to help. When I checked in I have some food at home  witch is a nice gesture from him. He gave me some tips to visit the city  the beaches restaurants. For those who nice nature this is a great spot. To go tho the nearest beach (15 min walking) Mirtiotissa beach. I will be back again for sure.
1690099,Gary August 2019 Lovely place. Secluded location. Regular bus at end of road if you don’t have car. Well stocked with coffee  food for arrival which is a ice touch.  Be mindful that check in is before 2pm if you have a late flight.
1690099,Marta August 2019 Cannot recommend Stavros' place enough. He was one of the best host we've ever met and we felt at home in the studio. Just brilliant!!
1690099,Julia July 2019 Just perfect.
1690099,Rachel July 2019 Clean  well equipped studio in a great location for Mirtitossa beach  about a 12 minute downhill walk. 20 minutes uphill back though! Really quiet  peaceful spot which feels safe and secure behind a set of locked gates  with parking space. Comfy bed  air con and nice clean bathroom with shower cubicle. Stavros provides a welcome pack on arrival with fruit  ham  cheese  bread and some wine  very thoughtful. We hope we'll be back someday  thoroughly recommended.
1690099,Maria June 2019 We had a wonderful experience staying here and exploring the nearby beaches and villages. Stavros is a great host and was there to greet us when we arrived and when we left. The place is very comfortable and we felt very relaxed and at peace. The nature around the house is really lush and it was great to be away from town. The nearby tavernas have good food and nice atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again!
1690099,Sam June 2019 Stavros was an excellent host who went out of his way to ensure we were comfortable and knowledgeable about the local area. The studio itself was wonderful and stocked up with wonderful treats. The local area has a number of excellent beaches and places to eat  making it the perfect getaway spot. He was always on hand to provide advice and ensured we got to the airport on time  even during the early hours. I have no problem in recommending him or this place again and hope to be back soon :)
1690099,Paola June 2019 Nice and clean studio in very quiet place. Only 15 minutes by walking to Mirtiotissa beach. Stavros is an excellent host!
1690099,Jack June 2019 First time using air BnB outside the UK and was a perfect introduction  if you want an easy stay but away from all the big touristy things then 100% recommend
1690099,Anya May 2019 Beautiful   simple   quiet space. You have all ingridiens for perfect holiday. Hightly recomended.
1690099,Tom May 2019 Stavros' place was perfection; the perfect setting for a relaxing stay on Corfu. It's a very comfortable  compact space with everything one needs. The patio is so comfortable for coffee in the morning and throughout the day. The shower is strong and hot. The kitchenette enabled me to eat at home as much as I wanted. There are plenty of pots and pans and plates and utensils (and Tupperware!) Linda's well-stocked mini-mart is a 5-minute walk in one direction and the beach is a 15-minute walk in the other direction. Spiros 97 is a very good restaurant close by. I spent most of my time on Corfu enjoying nature and going on hikes and this is a perfect base from which to do those things. It's roughly in the north/south center of the island so everywhere was convenient. The road is shady and quiet. And Stavros is charming and helpful and returned every message I left him within minutes. Honestly  I can't say enough good things about this place. If it's available  grab it!
1690099,Ewa April 2019 Staying in this studio was absolutely amazing experience. Its beautifully located in a very rural area close to the beach and mountains. It's generously equipped in everything that a pair of nature loving tourists could want - from beautiful  sparkling clean bathroom  towels  hair dryer  iron  all sorts of pans and mugs and even a toaster and wine opener. Amazing value for money with birds waking you up every morning  fireflies in the night and fantastic host that will take care of you and make you feel welcome and safe. Bless you Stavros I hope we will meet again.
1690099,Lindsey April 2019 Stavros is a perfect gentleman who will help in any way he can. He made contact several times during our stay to make sure we had everything wee needed. The fridge was stocked with some staple items when we arrived and the studio was in good condition and very clean. The studio is set in a very peaceful location but is only a short drive to most destinations although there is a village shop in walking distance.
1690099,Kay April 2019 Great studio if you are looking to get away from all the hustle and bustle. It was roughly a 15 minute walk to a beautiful beach. Stavros was an amazing host. He provided a bunch of local recommendations and even bought us some food which we really appreciated. We highly recommend renting a car or moped so you can explore other parts of the island! Overall  a great value airbnb with an awesome host.
1690099,Mariana November 2018 We had a beautiful time in nature  next to beaches  forests  mountains with trails for long hikes. The accommodation is located really in the middle of nature and you can not hear the noise of cars or planes ... Stavros is a very welcoming and caring person. The equipment of the house is very simple  but functional. We will return!
1690099,Anina September 2018 I had a very nice stay at Stavros Studio. He picked me up at the port and also organized a rental car  which they brought directly to the Studio the next day. (No need to go back to the city to pick it up). That was awesome. There was food for breakfast and lunch in the fridge. I highly recomend it if you like nautre and peace :) thanks for having me!
1690099,Katarzyna September 2018 Cosy studio surrounded by the nice garden. Located close to beautiful different beaches. Recommended using a car or motorbike  because the nearest beach to walk on foot is dedicated mainly to naturists. But going by car you can easily find other beaches in the surrounding . There is a mini market in the distance of 8 min. on foot  opened 7 days a week. The host is very friendly and helpful. Do not be afraid of the food after arriving  because you will find some food products in the fridge submitted by the host.
1690099,Anne August 2018 Relaxed holiday in the nature. Nothing more  nothing less. Stavros is the best host we ever had.
1690099,Aneta July 2018 Great place - nice studio with a garden close to nature and walking distance to the village ( one way) or to the beautiful beach (the other way). Walk back from the beach quite steep but worth the effort. If you have a car great location to explore the island. Great host! I would stay again!
1690099,Mickaël July 2018 Stavros was a good host  very flexible about our arrival and departure  which we very much appreciated. The studio is super well equipped  everything you need and more is there. It is located in very calm and quiet spot  which was perfect with a car. There is also a nice terrace. At our arrival there was also some food available which was a nice touch. Overall we had a good stay  and we recommend the place to others!
1690099,Liz July 2018 Location location location.. The villa is just between 2 beautiful beaches .. and an Amazing host. Stavros is a legend full of tips and sorting all of life’s little storm in a teacup. Close to taverns and a private secluded space. We been to Paxos  Corfu town and our start of holiday was Stavros.. perfect way to start a holiday when he came to pick us up 5.00 am from the airport. Super host .
1690099,Norm July 2018 What a lovely place set in quiet space in the valley. Birds in the morning. Green space all around. Walking distance to Glyfada beach. Had a morning swim at Mirtiotissa beach before it gets crowded. Close to two eating spots. We found the little village of Pelakas 3 - 4 kms down the road. Real authentic Greek village. Greek music   food and old homes nestled on the side of the valley. Just happened to have a cultural festival on our last night. Thank you Stavros for meeting us at the airport. We enjoyed our stay.
1690099,Steven June 2018 An an exceptional host; willing to do that extra little bit for his guests to ensure our stay was pleasant  comfortable and enjoyable.
1690099,Alivia June 2018 simply amazing. couldnt have been better!
1690099,Anya May 2018 Lovely place. Ideal for nature lovers. Quiet and green location. Walking distance to beautiful small beach. Studio has everything you need for a happy holiday - little kitchen  comfortable bed  clean bathrom  hamak and little table outside  even beach parasol. We love it and will come back next year. Stavros is very friendly and helpful. Thank you :-)
1690099,Lai Mia May 2018 Lovely thoughtful host. Had snacks and essentials for us when we arrived  even dropped us to the airport at 4am! Would definitely recommend. Lovely studio very comfortable!!
1690099,Greg May 2018 Stavros deserves the great reviews he has. Very helpful  kind  easy to deal with  and a pleasure to talk to. The place is not huge  but it is a fantastic value (he could easily charge double and it still be worth it) and I hope we are able to stay there again sometime soon. Stavros is on of the best hosts I have dealt with through Airbnb and I have used it quite a lot.
1690099,Olivier May 2018 Nestled in nature  the Stavros studio is a haven of peace! We stayed for a week and enjoyed the island. To discover the majority of coves the rental car is indipensable. Stavros deserves his title of superhost: he picked us up at the airport in the middle of the night  when we arrived  he took the time to explain everything to us including the good plans to visit the island. He had even planned something to eat! Everything was great. We only want to go back with our children next time because suitable for families!  Thank you for everything !
1690099,Laetitia April 2018 Thank you for your welcome  we enjoyed our stay. Stavros is a very nice person. A beautiful meeting  thank you
1690099,Roland April 2018 The numerous positive feedbacks regarding Stavros and his studio in the nature (there are two identical studios wall-to-wall) have proven to be deserved and absolutely reliable. So we shall add this as one more thumbs-up feedback with an ‚efikaristo‘ to our gentle and friendly host Stavros. Nice cosy studio. Lovely nature surrounding it. Calm. Only a twenty minute hike to nice Glyfada beach. Perfect for us (father and two kids  age 10 and 12). We really enjoyed it.
1690099,Nicholas November 2017 Great  accommodating host gives you everything you need!
1690099,Olivia October 2017 I truly believe my time here was my best Airbnb experience to date. Not only did Stavros pick me up from the dock  I was greeted at the studio with a full fridge and the most relaxing ambiance. The studio is in the perfect location  perfect for families  couples  or  like me  the solo traveler! Stavros also gave me great advice on places to see while I was on Corfu and even helped me rent a car  which was delivered right to the studio. I am beyond grateful for my time here and can not wait to make another trip to this beautiful island in the near future! 💙
1690099,Koen October 2017 Amazing place and superb hospitality  thanks Stavros
1690099,John October 2017 We adored our stay and Stavros is a gent and I cannot give him 6 stars but he deserves them. The location is very quiet and this suited us wonderfully and nearby (3 km) is perivales where you find 3 super restaurants (Alexandros  jimmy and the pink panther). It's about 30 mins to Corfu town and a (real) supermarket or there's a corner shop 5 mins walk (aka in Corfu a supermarket). Myriotissa beach was an eye opener and down a very steep hill but worth the effort - or drive and park on the steep path at your peril!!!!! Glyfada beach is the same distance and down a different path and lovely too. Possibly the most beautiful beaches in the world? Had trouble with mosquitos so take some squirty for the evenings. The bed was comfy and the studio appt was wonderful for 2 (there's beds for 4 but you'd need to know the other 3 v well to have more than 2!). Go there - you wont regret it!!
1690099,Marine September 2017 Our time in Korfu was very nice! the Studios are nice  good situed and calm  there were everything we needed. Stavros is nice  guest friendly  he knows the area very good and helped us  answered quickly.
1690099,Katarzyna September 2017 We spent good time  Korfu is beautiful  Studio was good place to rest  Savros is good host  take care about us. Description studio was exact like it was in real. I can recomend this studio ;)
1690099,Veronica August 2017 Stavros is a fantastic host!!! He also left some food and water for us in the fridge and gave us many helpful information ! The house is little but very nice  with a big garden. Above all it has a wonderful position  close to mirtiotissa beach and in the middle of nature. We spent wonderful days at Stavros apartment! Thanks!!!
1690099,Sandy July 2017 We recieved a very good welcome  Stavros came to pick up us in the airport. The house is very pretty and clean  with some food on the fridge for the first day. He also call a taxi for us because we can't find a number. He is helping in all the problem you can have. It was a very good experience and if we have the occasion to come again in Corfu we will rent the same house. Thank you for all!
1690099,Ignacio July 2017 An excepional place for its location if you are looking for quietness. Ideal for relaxing holidays. A great cosy place in the middle of nature. Stavros  the owner is so very helpful and gives good advice. The proximity to an exceptional beach enabled us to go early in the morning and make the best of quiet moments. Exceptional and recommended. THANK YOU STAVROS
1690099,Michał July 2017 Location is perfect. House is perfect. Stavros is the great guy with a big heart. Must be here  meet Stavros  enjoy Corfu island.
1690099,Katerina July 2017 Our stay with my bf in Stavros's studio was very relaxing surrounded by nature and was very clean and comfortable. For the price you get more than you can expect included some food and water ready for you in the fridge. The owner is very friendly and nice person  willing to do anything for you. We can't even imagine better host than Stavros! If we will visit Corfu again then we will definitely stay here! The best beaches close to studio (Myrtiotissa and Pelekas beach was our the most favourite from all Corfu).
1690099,Maurizio July 2017 The location is lovely  and Stavros is a fantastic host. What you see is what you get  place-wise. However  Stavros might surprise you with his kindness and detail oriented mind. Book his place with ease of mind  you won't be disappointed.
1690099,Annie July 2017 Stavros is an incredible host. He picked us up from the ferry and skillfully drove us to our secluded little garden home  which is nestled in nature. He gave us bottled water  beers  vegetables and sandwich fixings for our afternoon on the beach  and there was coffee and plenty of cooking supplies in the kitchen. The room had AC and was very comfortable  and the garden terrace was lovely for breakfast in the morning. A perfectly clean  sparkling  clothing-optional beach is a 15 minute walk from the house  and plenty of people on their way down offered us rides in their cars. We had our last dinner in Greece at a beautiful restaurant a short minute walk up the hill called Spiros Taverna 97 - also highly recommended. This was a perfect end to a very dreamy trip - would highly recommend!!
1690099,Konstantin June 2017 Spending 10 days at Stavros’ house was the best airbnb experience for me so far. The house is fully equipped for a relaxing holiday. On the arrival the fridge was full with groceries for few days including fruits  vegetables  cheese  eggs  water  wine... The house is literary in the nature  with a big garden  quiet  with no neighbors  and still close to fabulous Mirtiotissa beach  market  taverns… Stavros is a great host  easy to communicate  fun  and always available to help. He welcomed us and gave us interesting and useful information about the island. I definitely recommend the Stavros’ house in the nature
1690099,Sam June 2017 Great stay!! Very relaxing.
1690099,Kath June 2017 So lovely to be staying at stavros' studio again! Stavros looked after us SO well with lifts to and from the airport  a fridge full of goodies and a very clean   well equipped apartment. Idyllic surroundings.... didn't want to leave !!
1690099,Anya May 2017 The place was perfect for us - clean  modern enough  quiet  private. Stavros is the best host we could imagine - helpful  friendly but respecting our privacy. He is there for you if you need him - very reassuring for first time traveler. It was very helpful to find breakfast food for our vegan meal first day. Very considerate. Thank you. Studio seems to be perfect for nature lovers. It is serine and green with a bit of private area around. Stunningly beautiful beach is near by and interesting walks starting from here. Corfu town is 25 minutes away. We used our own car but one can travel by local bus. I would highly recommend Stavros place to all my friends . Read description - and if you like sound of it - you will love the place . We would love to go there again next year. Thank you lots  Anya  UK.
1690099,Ingrid May 2017 Thank you so much Stavros: it was not just perfect: it was fun : )
1690099,Dean May 2017 This has been my best Airbnb experience yet. Stavros is a kind and caring host and will make sure everything is perfect for you. The house is cozy and the location is picturesque. The most incredible beach is about a 10 minute walk away. The water is crystal clear so I recommend bringing goggles for scuba diving. There is a fairly challenging hike up the mountain near the house that leads to a 12th century church. You can see Albania from the top of the mountain. Worth the walk. I can't really imagine anyway an Airbnb could be any better than this. Highly recommend
1690099,Stephen May 2017 Stavros is the perfect host - friendly  helpful and generous. Apartment was well stocked with essentials for our stay  including breakfasts. Lovely  quiet location (with fireflies); clean and comfortable; well-equipped kitchen. A great stay!
1690099,Andi April 2017 Great host  beautiful place to stay...
1690099,Gudr November 2016 Fluent communication with the host. Very clean and comfortable place with airco and/or heating and a practical mini-kitchen. The place was a little difficult to find when we arrived late at night  but the host was so kind to meet us on the road.
1690099,Hélène October 2016 Perfect host  very nice and full of attention. He helped us to find all we needed in Corfu  I recommend! And the studio was also very nice  clean and calm. Thank you Stavros!
1690099,Nick August 2016 This is a must Stavros is the best host in Corfu and makes your stay even more enjoyable. Stavros is a fantastic host. If the rating was out of 10 he would receive 12 from us. He says it is his job but it's more like a passion for him. He picked us up from the airport and had food and drink waiting for us in the fridge. He made our stay in Corfu much better than we could have imagined. He helped us with everything we needed and we felt like we could ring him at any point if we needed anything for the apartment or even advice. The apartment was fantastic and was everything as described. Stavros was our host when we arrived but when we left it felt we was leaving a good friend. Super host does not justify Stavros he is much much more!! The area is just as described and is a paradise in nature. Transport is advised but the beach is still in walking distance. Stavros was our host when we arrived but now consider him to be a good friend. He did everything and more than we expected from him we felt like at home but we were in paradise. We recommend staying at Stavros's apartment he makes your holiday unforgettable.
1690099,Coe August 2016 There is only one thing better than the house...the host  Stavros will make you love this amazing spot even more.
1690099,Yana July 2016 There is little to add to all the excellent reviews of the place and its host. A little heaven on earth  suitable for couples but also for families with children. Coming back from the beach (10-15 min uphill) may be a challenge if you do not have a car or a scooter but this is why the area is so intact by tourist. The scenery is amazing and for us this is the best region of Corfu. Efharisto poli  Stavros!
1690099,Patryk July 2016 Perfect!!! STAVROS knows meaning of word Holiday!!
1690099,Gosia June 2016 House is amazing - located in the nature as described  close to wonderful beach Mirtiotissa. This place is perfect for those  who would like to fully relax and prefer quiet than noise of tourist resorts. Stavros is very nice person - he is the best example of perfect host :)
1690099,Rob May 2016 No-one could have been more welcoming than Stavros. The perfect host  he greeted us at the gate and explained all the delights of his wonderful B&B including a full fridge of goodies! The studio was just perfect with every facility and all in excellent condition. We stayed in some lovely places during our 16-day Corfu holiday but this was unquestionably the best for both comfort and location  right in some beautiful country yet within half an hour's walk of the beach and incredible cliff walks. We were disappointed that we could stay only two nights with Stavros - we would have loved a longer time there. If we could give Stavros six stars we would!
1690099,Bronwyn May 2016 Stavros was a welcoming  friendly and extremely generous host. He offered to pick us up from the airport in the middle of the night because our flight arrived late and when it could not land due to bad weather came the next day to get us. The studio sits amongst olive trees in an area of corfu with little tourism and very sweet friendly village locals. We arrived to a beautifully clean  sunny studio with a fridge full of supplies including everything needed for a delicious greek salad! He was constantly reachable and gave us great tips about where to go  hiring bicycles/scooters/car. The nudist beach is small and beautiful and 10min walk from the house.  We would love to come back and stay there again  absolutely fantastic accommodation. Thanks again Stavros!!!
1690099,Eliška May 2016 Stavros is amazing host. He picked us up at the airport  did first shopping of groceries for us  showed around and explained everything.  House is located in small village  surrounded by breathtaking nature. There is everything you need - bed linen  towels  hairdryer  blankets  pillows. Kitchen is well equipped also - seasonings  oils  sugar  tea  coffee.
1690099,"Will May 2016 Me and my girlfriend recently stayed for a week at Stavros' apartment. We had the most fantastic time and rest assured Stavros will do all he can to take good care of you upon your arrival and give you all information needed when you stay(and food).  All the things that can worry you about arriving on holiday are taken care of. We were picked up from the airport promptly upon our arrival and taken back in good time before our flight. There was fresh fruit  vegetables and food in the apartment for us and we were given plenty of great information about the surrounding area and visits into Corfu town which is only a short bus ride away.  The apartment is 5 minutes walk from the beach and very a cheap mini market  restaurants etc.  It was our first holiday abroad as a couple and Stavros does everything to make sure we had a fantastic time and for this I not only want to return but I am also very very thankful for a great time. Peace out Stavros ""the Greek""and thank you for everything.  Super host is an understatement!  Show more"
1690099,Irene October 2015 Stavros place is really in the middle of nature. It is at the end of a small valley  filled with olive trees and cyclamen patches. You hear the birds  you can sit in the green  and the beach is 10 minutes walk away. The most beautiful and quiet beach of Corfu that is  Mirtiotissa beach! We arrived late in the evening  we were so happy that Stavros had arranged a full fridge for us! Everything was there to start a good holiday. The studio is just right for two persons. A nice kitchen  a very nice blanket and everything cleaned very well. Stavros is a very attentive host  and also speaks a little Dutch ;) It was so nice of him to take care of us  we also had a problem with the key  he solved it while we were on the beach. We will return Stavros  good luck and thank you for everything!
1690099,George October 2015 Stavros was the ultimate super host! He picked us up from the airport on arrival and made us feel warm and right at home immediately. We arrived quite late in the evening to Corfu and most restaurants were closed  but luckily Stavros had thought ahead and provided us with delicious dinner provisions  meats  fresh tomatoes  cheese  fresh bread and fruit. Delicious! He helped us organise a car for an excellent price and showed us great places to visit on the island. Stavros also organised for his mum to wash all our dirty clothes free of charge- his kindness and hospitality was the best we have experienced on air b and b. I do not hesitate in recommending this host to anyone  the place was so lovely and quiet and very clean. It is close to two beautiful beaches and an easy location to reach the rest of the island. We had an awesome time  and can't wait to go back. Overall  an outstanding experience!!! Thanks so much Stavros :))
1690099,Kati September 2015 Stravos is the nicest and best host of hole Korfu! You will not find a person who is so warmhearted  caring and sharing then Stravos. From the very first moment he made us feel more than welcome and during our stay he always took care that we felt comfortable and save. The apartment was more then clean  very cosy  just perfect! There is everything and more what made us feel at home. The wunderful garden around the house with trees and flowers and palms was one of our favourites. The nature is unbelievable! The beautiful Mirtiotissa Beach which is near took our breath alway! It is just unbelievable  christelblue water  sourounded by magnificent extraordinary nature! Very near is also Daniels small monestry  which is worth visiting. If you ever visit Korfu  please look no longer for accomodation  Stravos place is probably the best place where you can go!!! We really felt in love with everything! Thanks for your open-minded personality  your help in any belongs  your warm welcome  the perfect studio and your unbelievable hospitality! You are the best host ever! Hope to see you again!
1690099,Sarah September 2015 Go without hesitation to Stavros’s house! It is a very very nice place inside olives’ trees and corfu nature. We loved it!! Stavros made our stay very easy by caring a lot about us and he is a very nice guy  very friendly! Thanks Stavros!!!
1690099,Josipa August 2015 Stavros is such a nice host and his apartmament is perfect  clean  well equipped  with a little kitchen and full fridge that welcomed us :) terrace and garden are sooo beautiful and our best time in corfu was there  just chilling and enjoying! Location is also great  just in the middle of everything and 15 min drive from corfu town. Thank you stavros for everythink  kisses from croatia!!
1690099,Kiran July 2015 We had a really good time at Stavros apartment. The location is fantastic and the host gentle and sympatic! I would defenetly go again :D thank you!
1690099,Katie July 2015 Stavros was a brilliant host from the word go! The apartment was perfect for what we were after and really was relaxing and just a few minutes walk to the beautiful Mirtiotissa beach (be warned - the hill is not for the faint hearted but will help wear off the effects of the Retsina!). Sadly we were only able to stay for three nights but would genuinely consider returning one day as we never got chance to visit the rest of the island - we were far too busy bronzing on the beach! Stavros welcomed us with a smile and a well stocked fridge and very kindly provided us with a transfer to the airport on our last morning which was very much appreciated. If you are considering a trip to Corfu I would highly recommend Stavros and his lovely studio!
1690099,Andreas June 2015 Five Stars! Stavros is the Perfect host  and the Studio was Fine for us all  a Family with two children  busstop  Mini market and Beach near!
1690099,Jorg June 2015 The house was beyond our expectations! If you are looking for a private experience and away from the daily trouble look no further. Stravos provided a warm welcome from the moment he picked us up. On our drive back  he pointed out various points of interest and gave us fresh bread and various spreads for breakfast. The Mirtiotissa beach is just few minutes walk away  with a gorgeous little sandy beach surounded by nature. The house itself is amazing  new  clean and fully equipped. We can't wait to go back some day!
1690099,Niels October 2014 The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1690099,Lauriane September 2014 The perfect location close to Glyfada Beach (the nicest one on Corfu)  the lovely apartment and Stavros (a.k.a. the Host) made our days in Corfu into über-relaxed vacations. Epharisto Stavros ! :)
1690099,Carlo September 2014 Stavros had sent us a rather intimidating set of instructions to reach his house which we disregarded  relying instead on our GPS. Corfu is the one place where you will never regret the investment in a good GPS. Stavros proved to be a perfect host  nice  always available  smiling and funny. We could not have hoped for better. His description of the apartment was very positive but reality vastly surpassed expectations. The location is great  half way between Kerkyra  the main town  and Paleakastritsa to the north. The apartment is in the the forest  quiet and peaceful but you soon find out that the beach (Myrtiotissa nude beach) is within walking distance. A good climb  on the way back  but a great exercise. We never used the car to go to the beach. If you prefer a more family oriented set-up glitzy Glyfada beach is easily reached by car. Stavros apartment is very well equipped and nothing is missing. He gave us a WiFi egg which was a godsend. A mini market is nearby where you can find most of what you need but large supermarkets (Lidl  Diellas  Markato etc) can be reached in 15 minutes. Stavros gave us his WiFi egg and this proved of invaluable help. We really enjoyed our stay in Corfu and we are already thinking of going back. At Stavros place  of course. Show more
1690099,Deborah August 2014 Stavros was amazing! A great host  who went out of his way to give us clear directions to get to the house  showed us where everything was  even bought us garbage bags when we ran out! He checked up on us and made us feel right at home. He was very accommodating  and hospitable. Made our stay in Greece feel right at home. I would highly recommend staying here if given the opportunity! Its a great house outside of the Corfu Town  and right near the beach! Stavros is awesome.

It really all worked out  from the directions/bus line from the airport to the apartment in advance  then the great reception and with everything you need for the first day on vacation! The apartment is so beautifully located in the nature of Corfu that you can really switch off. I really loved everything about it:) the apartment was super clean and there was everything you need. The Mirtiotissa beach is about 10-15 min. away and really very nice. I also walked to Glyfada many times  the little path there was adventurous but fun! :D The beach and the water there were also really beautiful. All in all  it was a great vacation and I highly recommend this apartment! Stavros  I think I've never had a great host like you! Thank you very much for the wonderful vacation!!!

1690099,Aurelie July 2022 Quiet accommodation  surrounded by nature  not far from 2 very good taverns and 2 beaches (quite steep  bring good shoes!)

1690099,Tina June 2022 The studio is very well located - in the middle of the countryside and close to 2 very different beaches. It was clean and well equipped - we filled up very well there. Nearby are 2 tavernas and a supermarket  so you don't miss anything. Kerkyra can also be reached quickly by bus.  Stavros was always there for us if we needed anything. I am thrilled with the Greek hospitality all over the island and look forward to the next trip there. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Patricia October 2021 The accommodation is rather quieter/more rural  which makes the charm absolutely. Stavros is a very friendly  helpful and fun host. Everything you could need is available in the accommodation. We also had water and something to eat for the first day in the refrigerator of Stavros. The beach is about 10-15 min walk away and really beautiful. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Iris August 2021 The apartment is simple and simply perfect! We felt very comfortable right away. Stavros is a perfect host and takes care of his guests.

We felt completely comfortable and will gladly repeat Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Laura October 2019 So much peace and relaxation that it is downright scary. Super nice mini market within walking distance and the most beautiful beach in Corfu in 15 minutes on foot! Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Jarosław August 2019 the host is very nice and helpful and it is ok  the location is quiet and calm  a little walking  we like it  we just like it  Glifada beach is quite steep but you can do it next to it  there is a nudist beach next to it so not for us with kids  next to a toddler as an alternative to the non-professional. when it comes to the cottage  it's actually one room and the bathroom we slept in. but for some people  it might seem a bit too small. An old stove model but working. The younger daughter was terrified. Unfortunately  it's everywhere in Corfu. Translated from Polish  Show original
1690099,Melanie July 2019 What hospitality!!!! Rightly a SUPERHOST! Stavros makes you feel at home from the 1st moment until you leave. The fridge was richly stocked  and wowww what a privacy  in the middle of nature!! The cottage has everything you need  an ideal base from which to explore Corfu! Stavros thank you for everything  we will definitely come back! Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Mickael July 2019 Perfect accommodation with nothing missing  excellent welcome  thank you very much Stavros. Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Olga June 2019 A beautiful quiet secluded place in nature  close to a picturesque wild sandy beach (the left part is for nudists  fenced with rocks). There is also another sandy beach nearby  equipped  with hotels around. The road to both beaches is quite sloping. There was already food and water on arrival  which is very convenient when you arrive late. There is a shop nearby 10 min walk  works until late. There is a place to relax both outside and inside. Thank you very much Stavros for your hospitality and comfortable accommodation! Translated from Russian  Show original
1690099,Mat October 2018 The place is exactly as it was described. The space and amenities are in perfect condition  the surroundings are fantastic. The guest friendliness radiates from everything. From to! The transfer is perfectly arranged. Communication is effortless and friendly. No 'hang-ups' at all. Air BnB as it should be! Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Imkea October 2018 The cottage is great for 2 people. A very nice shower and everything well taken care of. Stavros is also possible in Dutch. Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Margitta Und Uli October 2018 The place was exactly as described. The studio was easy to find with Stavro's location via maps. Stavros is an excellent host  he personally greeted and instructed us on arrival. We got tips for excursions  restaurants  beaches  etc.  The communication with Stavros was very good via mail and WhatsApp. We were pleased with a great selection of fresh food on arrival. Basic equipment of everything necessary (spices  tea  vinegar  oil  toilet paper  detergent  etc.) was also available. The studio is very functional and there is everything you need for a relaxing vacation.  There are even umbrellas and a small cooler for the beach. Bed linen and towels can be changed during the stay if necessary. Nearby is a small but very well-equipped supermarket.  The path to Mirtiotissa beach is not far on foot  but very steep. You should be good on foot. We found the beach to be very nice  but it was unfortunately very crowded and tight even in the off-season. Only 4 kilometers by car is the beach of Glyfada  where you have much more space (at the end also possible nudist)  Unfortunately  there is hardly any sun on the property in the morning and evening (at least in September).  Overall  you can fully recommend the place and the host Stavros. It is ideal for people who like to be in nature. A car is a great advantage.  We would like to thank Stavros again for the two relaxing weeks. Show more Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Sophie May 2018 Stavros is a welcoming and very friendly person. Her studio is an ideal place to relax  admire nature while being close to beaches and walking trails.

In short  we highly recommend Stavros place and studio! Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Anne April 2018 Danielo is a perfect host: attentive  patient (he waited until two in the morning because our plane was late)  available and always smiling  he did everything to make our stay a success  until he left us something to eat for the first days in more quantity. The garden is the second room of the studio: terrace table and chairs for meals  hammock  sun loungers... ideal for lounging! Bringing a few muscles to get to the beach - it can be won! Go there without so much as a second thought  it's just perfect. Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Louis November 2017 Stavros is a beautiful person; he is very attentive and makes every effort to ensure that the stay goes smoothly: explanations for the itinerary  warm welcome with food in the fridge and a bottle of wine! Recommended! Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Carola October 2017 Stavros studio is perfect for living Corfu surrounded by nature. The best welcome I've received from a Host so far. The studio is essential but with everything you need and Stravos is kind and thoughtful. It's best to have a car to get around  even if it's Translated from Italian  Show original
1690099,Michaela October 2017 A great place for nature lovers  with lots of greenery and shade. The beach is probably the best one on the island  tiny  sandy. Accommodation is standard  big courtyard is also good for games. Stavros is great  responsive  and most importantly  he has prepared some basic groceries and water for us so we don't have to go to the store right away. Translated from Czech  Show original
1690099,Stéphane September 2017 Beautiful apartment a few minutes' walk away (it descends on the way  it climbs back) from one of the most beautiful beaches in Corfu (nudist  but not that  it's a public beach). In nature  quiet  extremely well equipped  perfect internet connection  close to shops and taverns (by car it's best if you want to eat very well)  this rental is ideal for couples or small families with 2 children. Thank you Stavros  we will come back without hesitation (this is already the second time we are coming  but at the time we did not book with Airbnb). Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Bruno August 2017 Go to Stavros   you won't be disappointed!! Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Sébastien July 2017 Very good place to visit the island. Pleasant welcome. Simple and friendly. No complaints. I recommend it! Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Els May 2017 For us  Stavros' apartment was an example of the difference between being good and enthusiastic about something. We are enthusiastic. Because beautiful and quiet location in nature  attractively decorated  care and attention has been paid to everything  first things to eat are ready. Last but not least: the host is top! Committed  hospitable  helpful and pleasant & fast in communication. He lives up to the announced promises! Translated from Dutch  Show original
1690099,Eric April 2017 The Studio de Stavros is really very well located  clean and very pleasant. The city of is in Corfu is 20 minutes away and the island is really very beautiful. Stavros is really charming (He picked us up from the airport!...) as well as all the people we met a small beach next to the studio is very nice (nudist the beach!...)  in the village there is a nice bar and restaurant and a small grocery store where you can all find it. Our week-long stay in April was very sunny but not too hot so for this period you need to bring warm clothing for the morning and evening and short for the afternoon. So I would recommend this destination and the Stavros studio to everyone Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Véronique April 2017 Stavros is a lovely host  available and caring about our comfort. Her studio is simple but well-equipped and very clean. It is ideally located for discovering Corfu. Recommended without hesitation. Translated from French  Show original

1690099,Marine August 2016 We stayed 3 nights with my 5 year old daughter. For who owns a car the place is beautiful and really away from the tourist traffic of the island. The terrace is superb and flowery  the apartment very clean and comfortable and the presence of air conditioning a more pleasant. Stavros was particularly welcoming and attentive; the fridge was even full on arrival! He also helped us find a new place to stay during the busy travel season. A place to recommend without hesitation Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Lucie July 2016 Stavros is a great place to stay  location is nice  beautiful beach in walking distance  peace and quiet. Translated from Czech  Show original
1690099,Elsbeth July 2016 Want to discover Corfu as it's intended? Stay in a beautiful place that is full of comforts and close to the most beautiful beach? Do you like arriving at a place where the fridge is full of tasty things and warm and welcoming but not obtrusive? Then I warmly recommend this place! We have enjoyed this place in the green nature. Plenty of space and shade or sun  just what you want. Beach  hiking trail  mini market and eateries within walking distance. Rest of the island to be prepared within max 45 minutes. Cottage is neatly decorated and clean. The kitchen is at your disposal and all basic items  herbs  oil  towels  etc. are provided. The wifi was fast beyond expectations. By the way  you don't need it for tips because Stavros can help you with that in a pleasant way (not too present but cozy and available if you want). You can park in the shade in front of the door  but you can also be picked up/brought from the airport or boat. If we go to Corfu again  we will definitely come back.

1690099,Corinne Et Christophe June 2016 Accommodation as described and located in the middle of nature  very quiet. Great place to rest.

You can book it without any hassle. Translated from French  Show original
1690099,Patricia May 2016 Stavros' house was the best of the ones we were in Corfu  by far! It is in a beautiful place  close to the beach and is the perfect place to relax and get to know the whole island from.  The house has everything you might need and Stavros is a lovely host. When we return to Corfu we will repeat with Stavros! Translated from Spanish  Show original
1690099,Anja May 2016 My break in Stavros' studio was simply pure relaxation and relaxation thanks to its commitment and support as well as the preparation and loving care of this small paradise! The communication in advance about arrival and possibilities on site already gave me a good and relaxed feeling. As a super service I found it to be picked up from the airport and brought back  even in the morning at 7am. A big surprise was the all-round supply with basic groceries  so I could just go on vacation without having to go shopping. The kitchen equipment including things you don't actually want to buy on vacation but need for cooking was great - various oils  salt  spices  teas  just thought of everything. I find the studio itself tastefully decorated. It radiates a friendly welcome atmosphere  so I also enjoyed staying in there during some rainy hours. The quite cool evenings were comfortably tolerable thanks to heating fans. Breakfast on the terrace in the middle of the countryside overlooking the colorful hammock  which made a really good mood  or the evenings where the dark garden sparked with fireflies - everything contributed to an intense feeling of well-being! Laundry detergent in the bathroom  an extra umbrella for the beach  towel change after three days - so many small details that I didn't expect  but I was wonderfully pleased about! Stavros has asked several times if I still need anything  was always available and answered all concerns very promptly. He seemed willing to organize pretty much everything for me as a guest as possible. His tips on the local and wider area including checking bus schedules and explanations for safe stay at various places were super helpful. Stavros was open to constructive improvement ideas  which I liked very much. Overall  I really liked his easy  friendly manner and  in particular  I liked the respect and goodwill with which he informed us of our presence in the other studio. So no question  Superhost is more of a minimum rating  in Stavros Studio and with him as a contact person there is nothing missing! A thousand thanks to you  dear Stavros - I highly recommend your house to everyone! I'd love to come by again to relax! THANK YOU!!! Show more Translated from German  Show original
1690099,Elena September 2015 Stavros is a great host. He has really thought of everything  every little thing and was always friendly and helpful. This apartment is very good in terms of value for money  we particularly liked the terrace and the location (very quiet). We also liked the beach closest to it best: fine sand  clear water and some rocks on the sides where you can visit various fish and crab with a diving glasses. Stavros will tell you what the area offers. We would recommend this place. Translated from German  Show original
1690099,"Hein September 2014 A very warm welcome was the start of our stay with Stavros. Surprisingly  he also spoke Dutch. Excellent and clean studio  clean bed and otherwise well equipped. It's nice of him that he had done some shopping for the first needs. All in all a great place for us  rightly called ""in nature"" Repeatable. Ilke and Hein. Translated from Dutch  Show original"
1690099,Lucille August 2014 We were very satisfied with our stay in every way: Stavros is a very welcoming and very nice host  the place is quiet and beautiful (the beach nearby too)  and the price very reasonable. We recommend it without hesitation! Translated from French  Show original
547802911903195616,Petra (& Family) July 2022 We loved the location: view  swimming pool and large apartment  next to the pool. And the hosts are really friendly. They really tried to make our holidays as pleasant as possible. Unfortunately we were less pleased by the beds. To our opinion too hard. Also the house and premises could be better cleaned and maintained. Also a lock on the bathroom would be nice. So to our opinion the accommodation is over priced (we payed € 174 per night). But overall: It’s a wonderful place  and friendly staff.
547802911903195616,Julia June 2022 Great view  close proximity to the beach. Apartment was very clean. Remote control for a/c wasn’t working initially but this was fixed once we highlighted the issue.
547802911903195616,Ilaria July 2022 There are several areas that could be improved. A huge plus: the pool Translated from German  Show original
49451625,Šimon August 2022 Very nice apartment near the beach. Beautiful view from terrace. We would definitely recommend.
49451625,Katherine July 2022 Perfect one bedroom apartment minutes from the beautiful Glyfada beach. It's a beautiful place and the apartment had everything we needed and Maria and Stavros were very helpful answering questions about getting around the island. It was the perfect  relaxing escape from a busy life. We also enjoyed watching a few films on Netflix which was an additional bonus I hadn't expected! We will be back for sure!
49451625,Joke June 2022 We had a lovely stay in Glyfada! the host was very nice and helpfull in all ways!
49451625,Andrew June 2022 This is a nice compact apartment in a lovely location with stunning views. The resort was relatively quiet when we visited  which was perfect for us. Mapia was very helpful and provided everything we needed  including advice on the best places to visit around the Island.
49451625,Kim May 2022 Mapia was so helpful and friendly. The Appartement us clean and comfortable and the most beautiful view. We received alot of great tips and are already planning on coming back. Thank you for these amazing three days! I feel rejuvenated and full of great memories.

49451625,Rob May 2022 Fantastic apartment with simply stunning views. Mapia was really helpful and met us very late at night to show us the apartment and our parking space. The welcome bottle of wine was a nice touch. Very impressive broadband speed (22mbs) and very effective quiet air conditioning. A hire car is necessary in off peak periods. Thoroughly recommend both the host and apartment.
49451625,Aurélien April 2022 Very clean apartment  beautifully located! Maria was welcoming  and available  in addition to her good advice. The beach and the view are sublime  the place is quiet  the parking beach is a plus. A great week in a great place!
49451625,Michaela April 2022 we had a very nice stay and maria was a very nice host!
49451625,Lisa October 2021 We spend nearly a week at Maria's place. The apartment was really beautiful with sea view - a perfect place for watching sunsets. Maria and Stravos were perfect hosts - the communication was very easy and we got recommendations for places to see during our stay.
49451625,Tony October 2021 A lovely apartment  perfect for 1 or 2 people.  Huge  very comfortable bed  with exceptionally clean and pressed sheets!  Amazing view from the balcony overlooking the beach  perfect for waking up to see the sun rising over the bay.  Lots of space  plenty of chairs  table  plates  mugs etc.  Fresh towels and shower gel provided!  Reserved parking space  and only a 2 min walk to the beach.

49451625,Hannah October 2021 Maria and Stavros were brilliant hosts  and met us to show us where to park. They made us feel at home straight away  and gave us a very warm welcome!

49451625,Tom October 2021 Fantastic location with great views of Glyfada - we loved being able to walk less than 5 minutes to the beach for a swim. Transport to Corfu Town is also easily accessible with bus stop close by.  Maria and Stavros' apartment was well equipt with everything we needed for our stay. They met us from our connection and made sure we could get food and supplies etc which was much appreciated. We had an amazing holiday and look forward to returning in future. Would recommend this stay and hosts to others.
49451625,Piotr October 2021 This place is a cozy & comfortable apartament with the beautiful view and 2 mins from the beach. You drink your morning coffee seating on the sunny balcony and watching waves. Highly recommend!
49451625,Jasper October 2021 Perfect flat for a few relaxed days by a beautiful beach! Maria and Stavros are excellent hosts and made everything easy. We would recommend getting a car as Glyfada itself is very quiet  but there's a picturesque village  Pelekas  5 minutes drive away with good restaurants and tavernas.
49451625,Christopher September 2021 Ionian Senses is a nice  clean and comfy apartment in Glyfada. Communication with Maria and Stavros was easy and warm.
49451625,Ricarda August 2021 We stayed at Maria’s apartment for one week in august and had a really nice and relaxing time. The apartment is very sweet and comfortable  we had everything we needed (including extra towels  a welcome wine&water  oil/spices/coffee  and sun-umbrellas to take to the beach!) and Maria was very friendly und trustful. Plus the balcony with sea view was amazing. :)  The area or „village“ of Glyfada itself was a little different than we expected it to be but since we had a car rented we were able to get to other places if we wanted to.
49451625,Miguel August 2021 Perfect! Everything we needed was in the apartment. Super close to the beach!
49451625,Leoni August 2021 Due to personal circumstances I couldn't go to Greece. However  Maria was very understanding and accommodating. My friends went anyway and loved their stay! I hope to visit her lovely apartment someday :)
49451625,Bjarke August 2021 We had a wonderful stay at Mαρία’s apartment. She had great hospitality and gave us some great tips. The place was spotless and we got water and wine for us when we arrived :) The area is nice  it is one of the best beaches in Corfu. A sandy beach and a lot of space  with fever hotels around than other beaches. And with Pelekas just around the corner  and every other destination on the island within a driveable distance  this place has a perfect location.
49451625,Pia July 2021 Lovely  small apartment with amazing views. We almost lived on the balcony. Lovely resort and the most amazing sandy Beach with crystal clear water. Pelekas (the village up the hill) has many lovely restaurants. Maria is a good host - easy check in  wine om the table and she is ready to answer questions and give good advice about sightseeing and restaurants
49451625,Anna Christina June 2021 The apartment is small and kept to its basics but the view and balcony doesn't get much better. If you are looking for a great view this is the place for you! Maria and Stavros are extremely nice and always fast to reach ☺️
49451625,Sarah May 2021 We arrived in Glyfada quite late in the evening but Maria and Stavros met us at the apartment to greet us and show us the place. We did not rent a car at first and didn't prepare for all the restaurants and supermarkets nearby to be closed  as we traveled to corfu in late May and the season was just about to start. Also  due to COVID-19  there was not a lot of tourism  so we assumed that this was another reason for the beach restaurants and markets to be closed (it almost felt like a private beach  so amazing!). Our hosts kindly gave us a ride to the nearest village that night  so we could get some groceries and have dinner in one of the tavernas. They also arranged a rental car for us the next day (which I highly recommend while in corfu!). The apartment was perfect: literally a few steps to the beach  situated in a cozy resort  which felt more like a small village. The big balcony was amazing  you can see the whole sandy beach and the turquoise sea from there. Apartment 84 was equipped with everything we needed  the only minor thing we would have wished for was a better shower  as the one on site had to be held in one hand and the water pressure was quite low. Other than that there is nothing for us to complain about. We had the best stay at Maria's and Stavro's place and enjoyed corfu to the fullest.

49451625,Romain May 2021 We had a very nice stay at Maria’s apt 84. The view on the beach is just amazing  the appartment is clean and calm. The parking is very close to the home so it makes a very good place to go anywhere. Maria is a very kind person that helped us to spend great holidays there.

49451625,Alvaro August 2022 We had a very nice time practically a few meters from the beach. The terrace and its views are undoubtedly the best. Communication with Maria and Stavros is very simple and friendly. They are great people! If we go back to Corfu  we would repeat. Translated from Spanish  Show original
49451625,Patricia August 2022 Very available host. great tips for sightseeing and restaurants. Wonderful view from the beautiful terrace on Glyfada beach. I highly recommend this place which was very clean. Translated from French  Show original
49451625,Lars May 2022 We had a very nice time here with Maria & Stravos! We were expected in an easy to find place and after that the parking was shown to us. A rental car would be recommended here. The apartment is great with a mega view  but the sound of the waves doesn't make you feel disturbed at night (even a plus for us). There are of course also some tips on things to do and restaurants from the hosts. We would love to choose Maria & Stravos as hosts again on our next Corfu trip!

16991160,Indre September 2022 The most amazing villa we had ever stayed. Stunning views of the sea. Susi and Dominic was so lovely and helpful with whatever we needed  really nice couple. We loved It so much it’s was just amazing
16991160,Annie September 2022 The setting of this beautiful house is stunning with amazing views  stylish interior sand a fantastic pool it was a magical place to relax. It is isolated and that is a huge part of the appeal. It was the perfect place to come back to after busy  hot days exploring the island. Susi and her husband are kind and enthusiastic hosts. Nothing was too much trouble  from booking restaurants and water taxis for us to always providing spot on recommendations for places to visit. We really felt we made the most of our time in Corfu guided and helped by Susi.
16991160,David July 2022 Just perfect. Amazing view  beautiful pool  spacious interior and Susi was a brilliant host. Already planning a return trip
16991160,Jack June 2022 We had the most wonderful time staying at Susi and Dominique’s villa  truly a perfect holiday!  The villa itself was clean  homely  and looks like it should be in a magazine. We came with our two and four year old daughters who absolutely loved the pool and Susi and Dominique were kind enough to get out extra toys for them to play with which they were very excited by! They were both so accommodating and lovely  it made us feel so welcome.  The view over the mountains and ocean from the pool is simply stunning and we spent many evenings admiring the landscape after cooking on the bbq.  We really loved going down to Glyfada beach which was perfect for the kids and only about a 20 minute drive away through olive groves and other beautiful scenery.  Thank you so much Susi and Dominique for an unforgettable stay in Corfu  and especially for all of the delicious home-made treats! Show more Response from Susi June 2022 Thank you so much Camilla and Jack. We had a great time with you and the kids.
16991160,Xerxes October 2021 Beautiful place and the view is even better than the pictures. Susi was extremely hospitable and made our time in Corfu one to remember. Highly recommend
16991160,Fredrik August 2021 Amazing house for our vacation in Greece! Susi is a fantastic host who is incredibly helpful to book boat rentals and recommend places to visit and to eat. The illuminated swimmingpool is the perfect place to have a few beers in after dark after a day of Corfu adventures. Generous outside space with multiple sitting areas and a large propane grill. I recommend booking a smaller hatchback car  because the streets of Corfu are very very narrow and at the popular spots also crowded. This location is impossible without a rental car. Response from Susi August 2021 Thank you  Fredrik  for your public and private feedback. - We know that without AC its difficult for some guest and we will think about to install an AC. On the other hand  the airbnb advertise sais that there is no AC and August in Greece can be very hot. - Until now  the WIFI was working without problems  except some days when they do maintenance. This sommer we had some guests who had to work a few days and they didn' t complain. I'm really sorry that you had problems with the WIFI. For the 4G  we can't do anything  a lot of areas in Corfu dont have any connection. We live in the wild  away from pollution and noise  but have to accept some disadvantage. - The wasps are a problem for some people and we really try to do our best to limit her spreading killing the queens in springtime and putting wasp traps on our side of the house and every day some hundreds are killed inside this traps.  I wish you a nice indian summer and wish you all the best.  Susi Show more
16991160,Giulia July 2021 Wonderful place & wonderful hosts! If you are somebody you likes to be in nature and doesn't mind having to drive to go for food or a restaurant this is a special place....the view and the pool are among the best in Corfu. Susy and Dominque next door are very gracious hosts who went out of their way to help us out and respected our privacy at all times. We left happy and full of stories to share!
16991160,Geoff August 2020 Beautiful Hosts  wonderful location  don’t want to write too much as everyone will want to stay! Geoff
16991160,Daniel August 2020 We spent a week in Susi beautiful house. The location is stunning  the view is amazing and Susi is not just a great host but also great source of tips and inspiration. We felt home right away.
16991160,Philippine August 2020 Fabulous and Holidays!!! We are used to travel with Airbnb but this is the best we’ve been! The hospitality of Susi and her husband Dominique is lovely. They are so sweet and so discrete in the same time.but always here when you need them! And the house is incredible...the view  the nature around  the house inside is so practical and beautiful.we have a one year old baby and I’m 6months pregnant of the second: this house made us the life so simple and we could really rest and relax. We are planning to come back! We loved Corfu!
16991160,Milo July 2020 We had a fantastic trip in Corfu  the house met all expectations and the view was indescribable.  Susi was a super host and provided us with the best tips for our trip every day. 10/10
16991160,Phillip October 2019 Susi is probably the best host you can find on the island and so is the view!!! The outdoor space is not fully private but the hosts make up for it with their kindness and helpfulness. Corfu can be very busy in summer  so this house offers a rare opportunity to get away from the masses and be more in nature and surround by local villages. Very unique!
16991160,Laura September 2019 My family and I stayed here for a week and it is a beautiful location. Warning  you will need a car to get there! Well worth it for the views  the sun rises and sun sets! We were met by Susi at a local village where we followed her to the house (we would have definitely not found it by ourselves) as it was late  she gave us a quick tour of the house and left us to get some sleep. The next day she took some time to give us a welcome chat which was great and enabled us to get some good tips of where to go and what to see. The property was squeaky clean and tastefully furnished. The amenities at the property were good and we were able to enjoy a nice Sunday afternoon BBQ. The kitchen is a little small and wouldn't lend itself to cooking a big family meal (no oven) but was completely adequate for our needs as we ate out most lunchtimes. Susi and Dominique were consummate hosts and didn't leave us wanting for anything  even a daily service of freshly filtered water. If you are looking for a beautiful  relaxing place to stay whilst on Corfu then this is the place for you.
16991160,Laura July 2019 The house is fabulous   exactly like the pictures. The view is breathtaking  the swimming pool is just superb and warm ! It is a very relaxing and quiet atmosphere. Susi and Dominique are great hosts  always smiling and there to help. Susi gave us a lot of tips and beaches to visit and we were really happy with her ideas. Thank you so much for this great week in Corfou!
16991160,Brad July 2019 The location and views are AMAZING! We loved the pool  patio  outdoor grilling and the star gazing at night! Susi is a gracious host and provided prompt communication  great local recommendations and thoughtful assistance. If you're looking for something private and even a bit rustic this is a wonderful place. Please note that you will need a car as the amazing views do come with a somewhat remote location.
16991160,Vicki June 2019 Susi was a fantastic host with excellent local knowledge of beaches  boats and restaurants. The villa is perched on top of a hill over looking the coast. Lovely pool area to soak up the sun. You definitely need a car for this location. The villa met all our expectations. A perfect get away.
16991160,Jamie September 2018 Susi and Dominic were extremely welcoming  thoughtful and accommodating throughout our stay. We were impressed even before our arrival when Susi offered to go shopping and purchase some items of our choice for arrival.  Susi’s passion for her guests welfare and comfort is evident in every interaction  I felt she was always looking for opportunities to improve our stay E.G. Offering local tips/ guidance/ restaurant recommendations and offering to replenish household items. Welcome nibbles  drinks and chat were a very nice touch and civilised way to begin the holiday.  The House is beautiful inside and out and truly fits in with the surrounding area. The house is well appointed and offered all of the amenities we could wish for. Despite being quite ‘ bijoux’ in size  the kitchen was very well equipped and allowed us to make several meals with ease. Noteworthy that the kitchen knives were actually sharp  not always the case in Air BnB accommodations! We were a little apprehensive about not having Air Conditioning  though having the doors open created a nice draft and the ceiling fans provided sufficient cooling. It was pleasant being able to have an ‘open house’ in this regard rather than having to keep everything closed up.  We stayed with our 3 month old daughter  our first trip with her. The house was definitely suitable for an infant. Susi provided a cot bed  bedding and mosquito net. She also provided a small paddling pool which was a nice touch. No electric kettle to boil water but using the hob was no problem.  Lastly  The view! Simply stunning  photos don’t do it justice. We spent a lot of time enjoying the outside space day and night. There is a lot of seating available. My father enjoyed the secluded swing seat under the Olive tree as some respite from the rest of the family!  A great stay  would recommend and return. Show more
16991160,Sebastien Stephanie August 2018 Very nice and peaceful area  with amazing view  ideal to disconnect with the world. Susi and Dominique are very nice and always helpful to make your stay perfect. We enjoyed this wonderful place.
16991160,Ulrich August 2018 Korfu with Premium View and high grade of Hospitality  We have enjoyed the 2 weeks first holiday at Korfu as a guest of Susi and Dominique. The house is designed in a modern style by a dutch architect and fully equipped with everything we needed for our 4 head family. Susi and Dominique had a lot of ideas for secret beaches and restaurants for us. Accomodation is highly recommended. We will come back. Thanks to Susi and Dominique
16991160,Jerome May 2018 This is such a wonderful place. The views are extraordinary - unlike anything else I've seen. It's so calm and restful and I can't think of a more incredibly situated swimming pool. The house is super stylish and thoughtfully designed. But above all Susi and Dominique were incredible hosts. They went out of their way to make us and our one year old daughter welcome (including getting a paddling pool for the little one). They had great recommendations and were always on hand if we needed anything. I would recommend this place to anyone in an instant! Response from Susi May 2018 Thanks Lucy and Jérôme. It was a great pleasure getting to know you and you will be welcome at any time. Translated  Show original

We'd love to come back!
16991160,Jack June 2017 Our stay was incredible! Only two nights long but Susi and her husband did absolutely everything to ensure our time there was precious. The house boasts unbelievable views and exceeded our expectations having looked at the photos! Thanks so much - we will DEFINITELY be back!

16991160,Matthias September 2022 Susi and Dominique are fantastic hosts  from the welcome with wine  snacks and tips to the great dinner on the last day.

16991160,Marine August 2022 We loved our stay! The house and the view are superb. Susi and Dominique gave us a warm welcome and gave us very good advice/help throughout our stay (booking a rental car  supermarkets  restaurants  activities  landscapes not to be missed). They were also very attentive with our daughters by giving us all the necessary childcare equipment. Recommended! Translated from French  Show original
16991160,Morgane July 2022 A little piece of heaven on earth … Hosts like us have never had. Susi and Dominique take their role as very passionate advice and want us to discover the authentic and less touristy side of the island! A tastefully decorated house  very well equipped (including the kitchen) and turned towards the outside with several dining and relaxation areas at our disposal. The showstopper is undoubtedly the infinity pool from which you can see beautiful sunsets! We absolutely recommend:) Translated from French  Show original

16991160,Julia September 2021 Susi made our first holiday perfect as a small family. Their hospitality is exceptional and more than lives up to their Superhost status.  The very stylish villa is located on the slope and therefore probably has the best view of Corfu. The interior design is very tasteful  the kitchen is well equipped and Susi made sure that our four-month-old baby also has a comfortable stay (crib  baby pool  high chair  etc.).  You definitely need a rental car to reach Susi's villa. She will be sure to point out NOT to use Google Maps in the region  which is very followable from her own experience! Follow Susi's advice to reach the village of Giannades via its suggested route. Google maps led us to a road turn that was too narrow to pass as well as very difficult to leave backwards.  We had a wonderful time and wish we could have stayed much longer. A real gem on Airbnb! Show more Translated from German  Show original

16991160,François August 2021 Beautiful home with an idyllic setting  far from everything. The hosts are very welcoming and offer good advice. The pool with sea view is splendid. An opportunity not to be missed!  Small downside : be careful of the wasps  they are everywhere and very many.  Little extra : There are very cute little cats all around the house and the hosts generously offer fruits and vegetables from their organic garden.  It is imperative that you rent a car to get to this house and  more generally  drive on Corfu. Susi has good contact for that. Translated from French  Show original
16991160,Tilman July 2021 We couldn't have had a better start to our trip to Greece. Great house  great secluded location  great pool  spectacular views and romantic sunsets. Susi and Dominique were of course the best. 5 out of 5 stars. We will be back. Translated from German  Show original
16991160,Auke & Ingrid June 2021 Susi is a wonderful and inspiring host. She and her particularly convenient and nice husband took care of the house and location excellently. We were welcomed and we closed with a very cozy drink with delicious snacks. Susi is a big lover of flora and fauna and knows the area well. Susi and her husband's advice are very useful if you want to make visits or eat somewhere. In short  the hostess and host are very helpful  friendly and have knowledge of the island.

569304796810423392,Zixuan September 2022 We had a great stay here. The villa is small but you have everything you need. The view over the mountain and sea is amazing! Swimming pool also very clean. In walking distance  you could reach the beach and harbor  where there are lovely restaurants. The host is also very very nice. Highly recommended!
569304796810423392,Jenny September 2022 we had a lovely week enjoying local walks  food and drink.
569304796810423392,Martin July 2022 Great villa  comfy and excellent pool and outdoor area. It’s up quite a steep hill but the surrounding beaches and area are well worth the hike!
569304796810423392,Isabel June 2022 A perfect stay! The villa is just as pictured and in a lovely quiet area. We really enjoyed our stay.
569304796810423392,Amanda May 2022 My boyfriend and I stayed at Villa Folitsa for one week and absolutely loved it. The villa has everything you need to cook (or bbq)  a hair dryer and even a washing machine. We spent a lot of time on the beautiful private terrace and in the pool. From the villa you can walk to two beaches and several tavernas. George was a great host  the communication was easy and he gave us many nice tips for the island. We would always come back to stay at the villa and can really recommend it for couples.
569304796810423392,Maddie May 2022 The villa was perfect for my partner and I. We loved using the pool and the location is great. Definitely need a car but Kassiopi is only a 5 minute Drive with everything you need. We were also able to walk 10 minutes to a small shop to get essentials. George was amazing  he replied to my messages promptly and sent us all the perfect places to visit while we were there. The villa is gorgeous and it was very clean  we absolutely loved our stay. We have left feeling very relaxed and recharged!
569304796810423392,Yulia May 2022 Quiet and resteful authentic house with an amazing view on Albania! Close to a port with a few bars/tavernas - truly a gem. I advise you get a small car to get around the island :)
569304796810423392,Corentin April 2022 A perfect stay. Translated from French  Show original
569304796810423392,Kevin April 2022 George is a very attentive host! On a trip with our 1-year-old  he made sure we lacked nothing (folding crib  high chair  etc.). The typical house we were in was beautiful with the pool which is a real plus (I imagine especially in summer  because at the end of April it was a little cool).  The location requires renting a vehicle as it is nestled on the heights of Agnitsini. The road to get there is a little jarring when you're not too used to going on this kind of road  but after a few days you get used to it.  The location is perfect for bouncing back on the various points of interest in the north of the island (very nice corners were recommended to us by George).  Go there without so much as a second thought  it's peaceful  it's typical  it's beautiful  the view from the terrace is great. And if you have any questions  George can advise you as best he can.  Thank you again for this stay. Show more Translated from French  Show original
49543795,John August 2022 Johnny's place exceeded our expectations. It was wonderfully well kept  stocked with everything we needed  and located in a beautiful spot with amazing views of the Ionian sea. The location was in an ideal spot on the island as well - convenient to the Old Town and many beaches and sites in Corfu. Note that Yaliskari is an amazing beach w/ an incredible taverna just below (a couple km) from Villa Nefeli.  The layout was perfect for our group of 10. We had plenty of space for everyone to spread out. Accommodations were comfortable  well appointed  and as described/shown. There were numerous beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces for everyone to gather. We especially enjoyed the infinity pool and many lounge areas around it. The large covered porch was an ideal spot for coffee drinks and meals as well.  Best of all was Johnny's communication. He was always quick to respond and communicated clearly. He met us at the house upon arrival and gave us an excellent tour and provided all info we needed for our stay. During the planning phase of our trip  he assisted us with wonderful recommendations & arrangements including a private yacht to Paxos & Antipaxi and a private chef at the Villa one evening. Johnny definitely helped make our vacation easy  special and one to remember. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Corfu!  A few other activities we greatly enjoyed in Corfu -- The Governors Olive Oil Tour  Aqualand  & Angelokastro. All were ideal for families. Show more

Our flight was delayed so we didn’t arrive until the early hours of the morning so Johnny arranged a private minibus for us. He also went shopping for us so that we had food for when we arrived. The villa was stunning. The views were breathtaking (even better than the pictures)! An amazing holiday was had by the whole family. Johnny also arranged a boat trip for us around Paxos and Antipaxos- which was also amazing!
49543795,Sarah May 2022 Beautiful secluded villa with absolutely stunning view  amazing pool and backyard  spotless clean  gorgeous decor and everything you might need. I cant say enough about this place and would give it 10 stars if possible. Our host Johnny was great  provided water and wine and even helped park the car since my dad struggled with a manual car. We are all sad to leave and plan to go back in September.
49543795,Imogen May 2022 Where to begin! We were a group of 9  travelling from the UK for my sisters hen do. The stay at this unbelievable villa was absolutely prefect. To begin with  the communication from Johnny from start to finish was incredible. He helped us with everything. He helped with suggestions  travel  transfers and was always available by phone. He also arranged a car hire for us to make our stay a bit easier  very last minute. The villa’s pictures do not do it justice - we couldn’t believe the view  it’s utterly breathtaking. The villa itself had everything we needed  from cups / plates /cutlery to fully stocked kitchen. It had several seating areas on various levels of the villa  and a second private pool house with more beds. On one of the days we walked to the beach and did some exploring then we found a bar. This was a very steep walk however  but lovely. We even managed to hire a local saxophone player for our last night  who played against the sunset at the top of the villa. From start to finish  we were absolutely delighted with our stay. This hen do was perfect and is now the most incredible lasting memory. The only thing I would say is  it’s up a very rocky / steep and uneven road - our minibus transfer couldn’t make it up the road and we had to walk. We explained this to Johnny who immediately came to get us and offered to arrange transfers that could drive up the track. So  having transport is absolutely crucial for this villa - I would suggest 2 cars for a bigger group. But if you are thinking about booking  look no further - DO IT! A big thank you to Johnny and the villa - what a break! Love  from the hen do girls x Show more

32511348,Kitty October 2022 Wow - what a beautiful location with stunning views. Corinne's place was the perfect spot to explore all the corners of the island. She was a great host  making us feel really welcome and offering helpful tips. We will certainly be back.
32511348,Keith October 2022 A phenomenal  absolutely gorgeous cottage with a super-hospitable host. A very romantic spot for our honeymoon.  Corinne was such as wonderful host  and helped us with recommendations on where to shop  and even assisted in preparing my luggage for shipment.
32511348,Monika October 2022 Corinne is very friendly and inviting person. She was very helpful and responded quickly to our requests. Her new dog is a bandle of joy also very friendly. Willa is beautiful and clean  bed very comfortable. Willa is located high in the mountains with amazing views. The only thing that was a bit misleading from the advert was that we didn't expect host to live on site and swimming pool not private but on host property garden. To get in and out of the Willa you need to pass host property. Perfect escape for young or retired couple. Response from Corinne October 2022 Dear Monika  I am happy that you and your family appreciated the confortable cottage and the beauty of its site. I am just surprised that you pointed out a lack of precision from me about the pool  as it is precisely described on the Airbnb site regarding the equipments. I must say I am a bit disappointed with your unjustified assessment... Show more
32511348,Jill October 2022 Stunning location. Accommodation is impeccably designed and furnished. Corrine is a really welcoming host. Its an absolute tonic away from everyday life. We would love to come back again.
32511348,Jack June 2022 We absolutely loved staying at villa eden. Everything about it was perfect. The view was breathtaking  one of the best on the island. The garden was beautifully kept  full of beautiful trees  flowers and butterflies! The villa was impeccably decorated  super comfy big bed and huge pillows! It had everything we needed. The perfect place to unwind and relax.
32511348,Matthew June 2022 Wonderful stay! All the photos actually don’t do the place justice. You have a wonderful view of the sea  great location close to numerous restaurants and beaches  and it’s super well hidden so you feel like you are in a world of your own.
32511348,Margaret May 2022 We absolutely loved our stay at Corinne's place. It was magical and such a nice oasis! We were greeted with wine  chocolates  and flowers around the studio to celebrate our honeymoon. Corinne was very accommodating and her place has everything you could want or need - as well as an amazing view! Highly recommend staying here!
32511348,Anna May 2022 It was a beautiful place!
32511348,Cody May 2022 Great place to stay. A little out of the way but that is a good thing on Corfu. It is a very quiet property. The Airbnb itself was fantastic and a great value for what it is.
32511348,Andreas May 2022 Let me start by saying this : we travel quite a lot for many years and always prefer AIRBNB vs hotel. So we have seen quite some places - but Corinne’s Guesthouse is anything but. It is nothing less than „a corner of paradise „! The stunning view over Ypsos   the sea   Albania and all the way to Korfu City has been absolutely breath taking. You wake up with a sunset above the sea and have sun all day long. The apartment is beautiful designed with lots of love for detail in every corner. It is very well equipped with everything you need for cooking and relaxing. Corinne also welcomed us any time using the pool. She also surprised us with flowers in the apartment   some gifts and a wine. We could not recommend this more and to everyone who is reading this : don’t hesitated a second to book it! You will not regret it   that’s for sure.  Corinna - thank you again so much for the warm hospitality and for hosting us for the 4 nights. We will definitely come back :) Show more
32511348,Rochelle April 2022 Highly recommend staying here! Corinne was a great host and her view was incredible. We especially loved the company of her dog Lilou  who enthusiastically greeted us anytime we were around. Corfu itself was a breath of fresh air and I recommend visiting if you’re deciding between places.
32511348,Daniel October 2021 This is a lovely little place with fabulous views over the island. It’s cosy  clean  private and is situated in a pretty garden amongst Mediterranean forest. It’s the kind of place you’ll get to know your partner really well.
32511348,Tilly October 2021 Honestly our whole stay at the villa as just magical. Such a beautiful setting and just out of the way enough that you feel at one with nature but also close enough to restaurants etc so that you’re not totally isolated.  Corinne was an amazing host and so super thoughtful! Everything about the villa is so well thought out and to such a high standard. Would recommend staying here to absolutely everyone! 😘
32511348,Jill October 2021 I can't rate this cottage or the host high enough and is one of the best AirBnbs I've ever stayed in. Corinne was spot on with her restaurant suggestions  help with figuring out transportation and all the little touches make this a five star experience. Not to mention the stunning views with our morning sunrise coffees and night time starlit glass of wine. I would love to return again.
32511348,Doug October 2021 AMAZING VIEWS  wonderful clean  beautiful and comfortable cottage. Words and pictures do not do this place justice! It’s probably the best spot on the island! Host was super helpful  and provided good restaurant recommendations nearby.
32511348,Luke September 2021 A really beautiful place to stay. The views are stunning and the apartment itself is really comfortable and well equipped. Corinne was very welcoming and helpful  providing a cot for our 5-month old baby (who also enjoyed bobbing around in the pool!).
32511348,Michael June 2021 Amazing little cottage in a beautiful surrounding - definitely a 5-star accommodation with a super helpful and friendly host
32511348,Harvey June 2021 Stunning location. Tucked away with the use of a lovely pool. Amazing views. Very comfortable bed. Highly recommended.
32511348,"Daniel June 2021 Wow! What a beautiful location. The pictures shown don't promisse too much. It's even more beautiful. Corinne is one of the nicest hosts we've experienced. She was helpful in organizing our trip with tips and managing activities. Even with the ""Covid-Situation"" it was no problem to fly from Germany to Corfu. We felt safe throughout. And Corinne gave us all the information like testlab in Corfu  etc. We'll be back!"
32511348,"Felipe May 2021 We absolutely loved this charming cottage nestled in the hills and offering a stunning view of the sea below. The cottage is tastefully decorated and built with modern amenities and good use of space. It's a perfect space for a romantic vacation in a serene setting. Corinne was a gracious and welcoming hostess and was always attentive to our needs throughout our stay. The added bonus was having access to the grounds of the larger house including a pool and an idyllic  comfy hammock. Pure bliss and relaxation. If you like dogs  Corinne's ""Lilou"" is an absolute treasure - a wonderfully gentle soul. She is sometimes seen relaxing on the premises and always happy to play if you want. She won't bother you at all  if you aren't a dog person though - so not to worry. Would certainly recommend this cottage and would be glad to return in the future!"
32511348,Gabriela September 2020 Corinne’s place is truly a piece of paradise. The views are amazing  the decoration is impecable and the bed is so comfortable! The house has everything you need for a short or long stay  and every amenity is new and of good quality. Corinne is also a great host  easy to communicate and accomodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Corfu and would stay there again if we ever go back!

Every little detail thought of and supplied everything we needed and more. The setting is so beautifully peaceful. Would 100% stay again if coming back to Corfu. Definitely recommend having a car here. Location is also great for exploring the island. Thanks again!
32511348,Katie Sol October 2019 Pictures can't truly capture the beauty and tranquility of this place. Tucked on a mountainside  the stone cottage had stunning views. The cottage itself was obviously well planned and the decor lovely. Bed very comfortable and had great sunrise views. Private from main house but close enough to pool and hostess. Favorite of all our stays in our 3 weeks in Greece!
32511348,Flo October 2019 We were staying at Corinnes´wonderful place for a few days in the north-east of corfu having a great time there. We were cordially received  the communication  check-in/-out was super easy and uncomplicated. Corinne was a very nice host taking fully care of us with help and recommodations. The small stone-house was cleaned-up well and neat with a lot of detail-love and everything you need. We really enjoyed our stay there and can highly reccomend Corinnes´place.
32511348,Hannah October 2019 Corinne‘s ‚Un coin de Paradis‘ is absolutly gorgeous! Everything is very (!!) clean and even more beautiful and stunning than the pictures can show! (Especially the view by day and night as well as the garden and the pool) The guest house is very stylish and well equipped. Unfortunately we only had 3 nights - but if we come back to Korfu we would definitly try to come back to Corinne. Response from Corinne October 2019 Thank you Hannah  always welcome!! Translated  Show original
32511348,Edward September 2019 A wonderful little cottage sitting alongside the main villa (where the owner lives) with it’s own private garden. NB the pool and hammock in photos are with the main villa but you are able to use the pool. This was our first trip with a baby (5 months) and Corinne was very accommodating in sorting a cot bed. Just make sure you are accustomed with 1st gear in the trip up to the property (more than worth it for the views)! Cottage well appointed throughout.
32511348,Mick September 2019 An amazing tranquil retreat in the hills with spectacular views of the sea. The cottage exceeded our expectations and the attention to detail to the interior was outstanding. The infinity pool was a welcome addition on the hot days. A great base to explore the island.
32511348,Lennard September 2019 I highly reccomand staying in Corinne's cottage. She is such an amazing host  willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The apartment is just stunning and simply perfect in every detail. Everything was clean  well decorated and the location has the most amazing 180 degree view over Corfu city and the coast. All in all the cottage exceeded our expectations. Photos can't tell the beauty of this place.
32511348,Celia June 2019 Thank you for a sensational stay in your little cottage. Corrine has put huge time and effort into creating an unrivalled get away in Corfu. You would struggle to find a better base for a couple looking to explore the island.
32511348,Cameron June 2019 This haven is even more beautiful than the pictures! We didn't want for anything and the interior was beautifully contemporary  keeping buckets of charm. Our host was helpful and lovely and if we do ever come back to corfu  there's no question we would come back!
32511348,Elisa June 2019 Wonderful cottage and good situated in Korfu. We enjoyed every moment there  the view is gorgeous and enjoying it while taking a bath in the pool makes it even better. Corinne was really friendly and helped us with all of our questions  by the way she speaks french  english and german which is also a bonus. I really can fully recommend it! Our trip was worth every single penny of it.
32511348,Eden June 2019 Corrine’s cottage is exactly like the pictures show! It’s very clean and very quiet and peaceful. The view is something you will never see again! I would recommend this cottage and Corinne’s kind and helpful hospitality to everyone!
32511348,Christopher May 2019 This really is a little corner of Paradise!!! A brand-new  comfortable and very tastefully decorated little cottage with the most stunning view ever! It has all the amenities you need when you want to get away from the noises of life and just unwind for a bit. Corinne is very friendly and helpful and she wants her guests to be as comfortable as possible. You can also tell she developed the whole property (including the beautiful garden) with so much love and sense of style! We absolutely loved our stay there and we will definitely come back on our next trip to Corfu.
32511348,Alessandro May 2019 An outstanding piece of Paradise!!! It is a brand new cottage with a breathtaking view! The place is immaculate  all new and planned to be perfect.

32511348,Michel June 2022 We particularly appreciated the decor  more specifically the attention to lighting. The personal touch of the flowers on the towels and the atmosphere ‘at home - cozy and inspiring calm‘ makes a real difference. Translated from French  Show original

The best part is the great view you have from your own garden. We highly recommend the place and would book it again if we are in Corfu again. As the view suggests  the location is a bit remote  which makes the accommodation wonderfully quiet. It is recommended to have a rental car so you can explore the island from here. Corinne is a super host and was always available to us. :) Translated from German  Show original
32511348,Nele September 2020 Dream house! Chic  new  down to the last detail just beautiful. 🤩 We could use the great pool and hammock at any time.

Everything is exactly as in the pictures and in reality even 100 times more beautiful - even if that is hardly possible:) The cottage is new and very clean  has the perfect size for two people and is lovingly  stylish and furnished to a very high standard. If you are looking for peace and quiet and dream of enjoying the view (down into the valley and over to Albania)  you have definitely landed here in the right place. We could use the pool at any time - another highlight! The cottage is a good starting point for many explorations around the island and the nearest beaches and restaurants can also be reached quickly by car. Corinne and her husband are wonderful hosts and we felt immediately welcome. If we come to Corfu again then definitely come back to this wonderful  unique place! Translated from German  Show original
32511348,Patrick June 2019 Great hosts  an exceptional place to stay. Corinne is a warm and great host who always cares about the well-being of her guests.

The nearest beaches are about 5-10 minutes away by car. If you are looking for peace  quality and a great view  this is the place to be. Hospitality is paramount with Corinne  on the last evening we were even invited to barbecue. Simply excellent! Translated from German  Show original
32511348,Annett May 2019 Corinne and her husband were great hosts and we felt super comfortable. The place is a dream come true.

Everything is easy to explore with a car or scooter  and supermarkets and restaurants can be reached in a few minutes. Translated from German  Show original
49088870,Hanna October 2022 This house is the perfect location to explore Corfu. We were within a 20 minute drive of many great beaches and restaurants. The host left us a bottle of wine and snacks upon checkin which was very sweet. I would highly recommend this Airbnb for your stay on Corfu!
49088870,Dutu September 2022 The house was excellent  photos were accurate  ammenities inside were as promised  very clean and modern  if you have a car rented then it is perfect.
49088870,Bozhidara September 2022 The house is amazing just like in the pictures  the communication with Dimitris was very easy and smooth. If you have a car the location is great - close to many beaches and to the old town of Corfu  the average travel time to the beaches and town was 20 min. Dimitris gave us a list of recommendations for beaches  restaurants and places to visit which was very helpful for us and I recommend following it. All in all we are completely satisfied!
49088870,Oded August 2022 Great place   great central location..highly recommended
49088870,Øystein August 2022 We had a great time at Iliopetra house. The house and interior was fantastic. Great location central on the island with good access to beach and Corfu town (you need a car). Restaurant recommendations from Dimitris was super 👌
49088870,Vicky July 2022 We have just returned from a week stay in illiopetra. The property is stunning and exactly like the pictures. The pool area is shared with a smaller joining property which was no problem  we made friends with the 2 lots of guests who were there. Lovely little private patio area to eat at on an evening. Everything needed to cook and eat in and was a nice surprise to find nice cold beer and wine in the fridge after a late flight. Communication with Dimitris was always quick and gave us all the information we needed. I would definitely recommend hiring a car as there is nowhere near enough to walk to from the villa. We used vidos car hire which were a lot cheaper than many we looked at. We also found a nice little restaurant/grill nearby called Paprika  food was really nice and cost under 100€ for 6 people. Would definitely recommend this place.
49088870,Marie-Theres July 2022 Its a beautiful house in the near of Korfu. The house was clean and Dimitris put some Snacks for us in the house before we arrive. Everybody of us were really happy with everything in the accommodation. Three Days somebody was coming to look at the Pool  but the persons are all kindly. We were a group of eight people and we would always come back.
49088870,Rasmus July 2022 Very lovely place. Dimitris was such a good host  when why had any troubles. Would recommend to rent a car.
49088870,Matthew June 2022 We had a fantastic stay here. We reviewed different properties in Corfu before deciding on this one and I'm so glad we did. It looks as nice in person as it does in the photos. There is a lovely pool  which is shared with the residents of the house next door (we made friends with the couple who stayed during our time there) and sometimes we had it to ourselves. It has fantastic air con throughout in all the rooms  which is great  particularly on a hot day. Dimitris kindly left us some snacks  fruit  wine and water when we arrived  especially helpful as you can't use tap water to drink from in Corfu. Initially it was difficult getting through to the host to book  but oncer we did  Dimitris was great and was able to answer all our queries. He also very kindly allowed me a call before we arrived and was able to provide us with tips of where to go  what to see and when we arrived very late  he messaged to check on how we were doing and that we had arrived safely and had all we needed. He had also sent photos/map details to help us find the property and allowed us a late check out  which we were grateful for. It's a great place to relax  the pool is fantastic  a great temperature in the heat and which is regularly cleaned. We loved using the espresso machine too while we were there and there was a range of really nice plates and cups to use for the days we stayed in and cooked. It's a great size  good to have a washing machine and although there was only 4 of us  more could have come  as it's a big enough space. Dimitris and the family have also added a table  chairs and umbrella which we could use outside every morning and evening. A nice touch was a family member stopping by in the week to check we had all the supplies we needed. It's 15-20 minutes from Corfu town  5 minutes from a nice water park which we visited and 10 minutes from a local bakery and other shops are nearby. We were glad we stayed in the middle of Corfu  rather than south or north  as it gave us the option to get to wherever we wanted to go. I'd recommend a stay here - it's great value too! Show more
49088870,Luaai March 2022 Many thanks to Dimitris for making our stay as pleasant as possible. The actual villa is exactly as was shown in the pictures  no regrets about picking this place whatsoever. Would highly recommend. Just a tip to anyone who wants to rent this villa  either have a car in handy or have a taxi driver contact as there are none in the nearby area.
49088870,Nunzio August 2021 The house is very beautiful  better than in the photo. The host is always available and polite. I suggest everyone who wants to visit Corfu to take Liopetra House.
49088870,Dragos August 2021 A charming piece of architecture. Warm and welcoming  yet spacious and modern. The architect made her point here. The pool  the details of the courtyard  the little touches of design within the olive snags and stone carvs  the combination between classic and modern furniture...really felt excellent. The location is ideal for explorers  being located in centre and  therefore  able.to travel 10 to 25 min to all beaches in the central part of the island or points of interest (the old city of Corfu  Achilion etc)
49088870,Melina August 2021 Our stay was perfect! The host is accommodating and the house is exactly like the pictures! Dinitris left us some breakfast  local products and wine for our arrival.This was beyond every expectation. If you rent a car this is is a great location to stay near Corfu center. Thank you for everything!
49088870,Leon July 2021 Dimitris is super welcoming and did everything to make our stay outstanding. We really enjoyed our stay at this fantastic place. Thanks! :)
49088870,Daniel July 2021 The house was as described in the pictures  and the place was clean and perfect when we arrived. Dimitris has been a perfect host and I definitely recommend staying at his place!
49088870,Luca September 2022 Beautiful house  very friendly host and available if you need it.

35185445,Tamara October 2022 Effie's place is fantastic! It's a great location in a charming mountain town; very clean  and wonderful views. Effie was great at communicating and welcomed us when we arrived  explaining how things worked in the house and answering any questions we had. An added bonus was the family's wonderful garden below the house. Absolutely gorgeous scenery!
35185445,Gabriela September 2022 We had a perfect stay at Effie’s. The flat was lovely and spacious  sparkling clean. Pentati is a lovely village with three restaurants (all delicious). We didn’t have a car but this didn’t matter  there is a sweet little harbour for swimming just a 10-20 minute walk from the flat. There is also a coastal path which leads to Agios Gordios (roughly 40 minutes). We also walked to Paramonas beach (50 mins). We would definitly come back!
35185445,Michael June 2022 We really enjoyed Effie’s Appartement. It was clean  well furnished with nice garden and a great view onto the sea and the beach. Effie is a great host. Communication with her was fast and easy. Everybody in the village is very friendly  especially Effie’s grandma supported us with lots of fruits from her garden.
35185445,Shahab June 2022 It's a lovely Town full of lovely Town folks  It's a lovely Apartment  It's a lovely View   I couldn't wish for more for my first Stay in Corfu. Everything was as described and Effie did a really good Job of communicating and checking on me.  I just can recommend her  her apartment and the the lovely village.  (also visit Angela's tavern  you gonna love it).  BUT 1 thing i have to warn everyone that books the place. Be a confident driver. the streets aren't dangerous but you need a lot of confidence to drive time. From time they feel dangerous!!
35185445,Alexander May 2022 We had a very nice vacation at Effis house  we can absolutely recommend it.
35185445,Carolyn April 2022 Great “off the beaten path” location! Beautiful view of the sea and the mountains. Effie was great at communication and helping with any need we had.
35185445,Florian April 2022 Effie's place is a little cosy paradise. It is tidy and clean. You have everything you need and in case there is anything that you are missing  Effie is always there for you. She is always helping and super friendly. The fire place is also a great freature that we came to enjoy as the weather was unusually cold for this time of year. The view from the terace is amazing and the beach is just a short drive away. We will definitively return!
35185445,Olga March 2022 Very nice cottage in beautiful local village! Well equipped (air conditioners  fireplace  hot water  wifi).  Great view from the terrace. There are two local tavernas in the village and mini market.  The road to the village is a little bit extremal  but if you are a confident driver it will be ok :)  Effie is a very friendly host  she helped us with everything we needed! Effie  thanks a lot!  Strongly recommend this place!
35185445,Giedrė November 2021 The calm stay in a local village with a beautiful small old town.
35185445,William October 2021 An amazing place to stay in the beautiful village of Pentati. Sitting out on the terrace and enjoying the sunset/stars was beautiful. I would highly recommend staying here.
35185445,Cédric October 2021 Nice place with a awesome view. Well equipped and clean  we loved this place and the village.
35185445,Maria September 2021 It is a shame I cannot rate this stay with more than 5 stars! Effie is a great host and amazing at communication - she helped with everything we asked. The house is in a lovely location with a breathtaking view  very clean and comfortable. I would definitely 100% recommend Effie and her apartment :)
35185445,Anneke September 2021 Effies apartment was the perfect place for a relaxing vacation on Korfu. It's fully equipped  nicely decorated and very clean. It's located in a small quiet village on a hill  so you have a beautiful view on the bay. There are two authentic greek restaurants just around the corner and with a rental car you can reach all areas of the island. Effie is a very kind and friendly host who was always there for us in case we needed something.
35185445,Lena September 2021 We really enjoyed the stay at Effie‘s apartment. Communication and check-in went well. To get to the village the path is quite steep and has many curves but the view from the flat is worth it! We even got some fresh fruit from the garden which was lovely :)
35185445,Ángel September 2021 The village and this apartment were for me the nicest place in all the island. Authentic greek life  calm and with an a amazing orchard and views.
35185445,Sebastian July 2021 Great apartment! Clean Airbnb with an amazing view. Effie was very helpful and quick to respond.
35185445,"Marta June 2021 The Effie's house is cosy place  located in beautiful traditional village Pentati. From the yard there is stunning view on the mountainous coast. The village isn't ""touristic"" spot at all. Old buildings  monastery  grocery with bread and fresh products  traditional taverns and hidden path to the empty beach. The house is clean and have everything what is described and even more. We were surprised with fresh fruit picked up from her garden. Effie is wonderful host. We have great communication during all stay and she helped us everytime we need. We hope to see Effie and Pentati village again!"
35185445,Tony October 2020 Effie’s house is a very nice place  breathetaking view to the open sea (view to the Agios Gordios Beach) and beautiful surroundings in a nice little village. We had wonderful breakfasts in the garden and enjoyed the hammock. The house is very cosy and comfortable  also with German and international TV. Everything was clean and perfect. There was also a very good baby bed for our three-year-old. Effie has a good sense for design. Thank you so much  Effie!
35185445,Lars October 2020 Everything fine

35185445,Andrea August 2019 Pentati is a magical piace to stay and Efi apartment was perfect for us: a beautiful view  an incredible harbour and all the traditions of Greece! Thanks. We hope to return soon.
35185445,Sini August 2019 Our stay in Efis apartment was amazing. Garden is just perfect and view was even better than we expected! We got all the help we needed and communication was easy. Pentati is quiet little village  just what we were looking for. There is little beach in walking distance from the house and whit a car you find many nice beaches close by. We tried one restaurant in Pentati called Angela's tavern  food and service was great  highly recommended. On departure day we were surprised whit fresh figs from our garden  efharisto! :)
35185445,Maksym July 2019 The house has been recently refurbished and now everything iside is OK including kitchen facilites  bathroom  badroms. It has 2 spacious apartments on the ground and 1st floor  small garden and nice view to sea and mountains. Located at the upper part of the village in a quite place.  Blocks of neighbor buildings are not completely finished  so you can observe some constructing equpment and a bit mess with matherials.  Efi is great and responsible host. She helped us with little things and presented a bottle of home wine. Actuallty two bottles.
35185445,"Michael October 2022 Communication with Effi went perfectly  as did check-in and check-out with personal key handover and instruction. The apartment was clean  spacious  as described and equipped with all important things. 2 bottles of water  some juice  lemonade and 1 bottle of wine were chilled ready for arrival. The coastal view is breathtakingly beautiful. The place offers 3 good local tavernas within walking distance with the best Greek home cooking and warm service as well as a small shop where you can buy everything you need (basics without too much selection  but sufficient). The ""swimming bay"" can be reached on foot in about 15 minutes  by car in about 3 minutes via a small  very steep road. Sand IS only available here IN the water. But always sufficient for an evening refreshment. Otherwise  the nearby beautiful sandy beach of Agios Gordios is ideal for swimming. Translated from German  Show original"
35185445,Madlen August 2022 This unique view of the ocean and the outdoor shower in the middle of the flower sea were unique! Effie is super nice and is available for all questions and excursion tips. Thank you Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Stefan August 2022 Effie was very available and kind. We had fruits and vegetables from the vegetable garden. The house was clean and the kitchen very well equipped. We'll be happy to go back to Pentati. ☺️ Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Miguel August 2022 Fantastic Translated from Italian  Show original
35185445,Tanja August 2022 Effie is one of the nicest hosts we've ever had. She was always available and responded and helped to all of our concerns within a few minutes. Whether taxi  supermarket  etc.  she took care of everything. The apartment looks like the pictures and the terrace is really amazing! Although the small village of Pentati is located outside  it is a super beautiful old village  in which we felt village known within 3 days and welcomed into the village family. There are two super nice tavernas where you can still look into the kitchen and choose your food without a menu. However  we would not recommend this stay without our own rental car. If we travel to Corfu again  we will definitely come back. Thanks for all the Effie! :) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Sophie July 2022 Very nice house with beautiful views and garden. The house is spacious and well-equipped. We really enjoyed the village of Pentati close to the beaches. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Andrea June 2022 Effie is a perfect host  she was there when needed but never unnecessary. She was also available by phone at night! Her house  with a garden anda view  is beautiful. But above the apartment  there's an apartment for rent so we didn't have the whole house to ourselves. The soundproofing of the house is very weak  and the people who live above us have heard every step of the way. Kitchen equipment is a bit weak  with little cooking pots but it's a creative way to get through it! 😉 The setting is perfect  the small village is really quiet  but there's a restaurant andconvenience store. It's the perfect place to hang out. Translated from Hungarian  Show original
35185445,Marion May 2022 the view is sublime  quiet place. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Thomas April 2022 Effi is a very good host. She was always available to help with any questions or problems. We enjoyed staying in the delightful village. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Juliane October 2021 We had a great time in Effie's apartment and in the small mountain village a bit away from tourists. Nevertheless  the beautiful beaches and hotspots of Corfu are easily accessible.  The communication with Effie was very easy and hassle-free. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Stephan October 2021 Great place   great location Effie looked after  advises excellently and makes you feel the Greek hospitality. - and all this authentic and without a lot of fuss - I would book again at any time Translated from German  Show original
35185445,卡拉卡拉仙人 October 2021 Located on a hill in the west of the island  the village has a beautiful view of the bay at any time.The host and the people in the village are very welcoming and warm  and the experience is great. Translated from Chinese (Simplified)  Show original
35185445,Flore August 2021 Very nice house  very clean. Terrace with stunning sea views  quiet  in a very pleasant and authentic village. Effie gave us a warm welcome  and was very available to avoid any difficulties on several occasions (coming in the evening to call a doctor for us  looking for a package). Effie's grandmother is lovely too and gave us delicious figs from her garden every day. In short  a little paradise  a big thank you ! Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Jasmin August 2021 It was absolutely perfect. Top furnished apartment and very large feel-good ambiance. Amazing view :) Very clean. Effie welcomed us so warmly and was always there for us with questions. In Pentati itself there are 2 tavernas - highly recommended. The nearest village for shopping is in Argios Georgios - about 8 minutes by car or moped. Tip: Be sure to rent a car or moped:) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Marie July 2021 The accommodation enjoys magnificent views of the bay  it is spacious and the outside is a plus. A small downside however regarding the cleanliness of the floor (under beds and sofas) and the lack of kitchen equipment available  which I found a little limited. Nothing bad though. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Juliette July 2021 Very pleasant apartment with a private garden and magnificent views. Effie is very responsive and welcoming. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Jean Michel July 2021 Accommodation with magnificent views  very quiet. Effile welcomed us around midnight ...She is very attentive. It takes a gps to find the village ( especially for a night arrival like us!). The village has two restaurants including a really typical one..We enjoyed the surrounding countryside  a small road in olive groves with century-old trees. The accommodation is well-equipped. We had a pleasant time. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Hannah July 2021 A beautiful place with small tavernas and a small bay that we could walk to in 15 minutes. Fantastic. The garden below the apartment was a happiness. We were provided with delicacies from the garden! :) Translated from German  Show original

35185445,Robert June 2021 We had a very nice stay at Effie's house. The apartment is equipped with all important utensils and the hostess is very nice  friendly and helpful. The sitting area overlooking the sea is particularly noteworthy. There are some animals such as cats and dogs in the area who like to visit again and again. Very likeable! Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Roghieh October 2020 It was beautiful and we had a relaxing vacation at Effie's place. Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Cecilia September 2020 It's been beautiful at Effie's. She is super nice and the apartment really nice! Very clean! The garden and the view of the sea are unforgettable. We got fresh vegetables and fruit directly from the garden every day. Definitely recommend! Next time! :) Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Floriane September 2020 The house is clean and functional located in a quiet village  enough to spend a relaxing holiday. However  the house is in the mountains  a vehicle rental would be expected in order to make the most of the island. Effie is very kind and caring  she will do everything possible to make your stay enjoyable. Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Pierre September 2020 Very convenient accommodation in a beautiful setting Translated from French  Show original

35185445,Βασιλικη August 2020 Thoughtful and welcoming hosts!! Efi asked us how many times we were okay  or if we needed anything  and they were always willing to help or help us with something. The house is very clean and tidy and has a disinfectant and has a washer so you won't need a lot of clothes!! If you are lucky you will leave with fresh goodies from the garden completely fresh and delicious!!! We were gifted it by Efi's grandmother  a very kind lady!!! Translated from Greek  Show original
35185445,Manuela August 2020 We just got back from the Corfu holiday and had 2 great weeks at Effie's apartment. She is a great host  the apartment just remodeled her  new photos should come soon  the garden  the flowers  the view of the sea...just magical. Half an hour from the airport  it is recommended to rent a car to explore the beautiful island. Here  too  Effie is here to help. We were travelling with our 3 sons and had plenty of room. Walk to the beach in the morning (over the floor and over stone) ... wonderful 😊Effie's grandma spoiled us with delicacies from her own garden 😋  So if you are looking for relaxation and recreation  you will get 100% money in the small mountain village of Pentati away from tourism.   🍀☀️🐬We are very grateful to have found this enchanting place 💖 Translated from German  Show original
35185445,Magali July 2020 We were charmed by Effie's warm welcome who was available and always smiling  the very nice touches from her grandmother  the magnificent view of the terrace overlooking the sea  the cleanliness of the house  the modern amenities ( air conditioning  washing machine  kitchenette  shower ...)  the decoration   the comfort ... We loved our stay in Pentati  a typical village from which we were able to enjoy the beautiful and quiet beaches of the west coast of the island. Only 35 minutes from Corfu  I warmly recommend this property. We'll be happy to go back! Translated from French  Show original
35185445,Achim September 2019 Efi's apartment is a cozy place with family connections and a great view of the bay. We have always been spoiled with things from the garden by grandma. Highly recommended. Translated from German  Show original
22682902,Kate September 2022 A beautiful  spacious villa in a great location  convenient for Corfu town  beaches and the rest of the island. The pool is fabulous and really private and peaceful. The photos really don’t do the villa justice. Peter was a great host  with clear and helpful communications. There are a few local bars and tavernas well worth visiting.
22682902,Blair September 2022 We had a great stay at this villa while visiting Corfu for a week. The villa was way better than expected and Peter was so helpful in organising taxis  boat hire etc. His communication was excellent and he was able to offer late checkout for us due to a late evening flight. The villa had a nice pool  and a well-kitted-out kitchen and the bedrooms were a good size. We would love to stay here again  it was absolutely perfect! Thanks Peter
22682902,Owen July 2022 The villa was fantastic  much bigger than I expected! The location worked great for us  day trips to beaches (pelekas and paleokastritsa) and Corfu town within 15-30 mins drive and quite a few good places to eat within walking distance (Costas Taverna and Pizza Nostra). The hosts  two brothers  Costas and Peter made us feel at home and provided great local advice. The private pool was very welcome to shake off the current great wave!
22682902,Aileen July 2022 Villa Lydia is a beautiful villa  and we really loved are time there! The villa itself is much bigger than you would imagine from the pictures  and really is the perfect retreat. It is well located  just over 10 minutes drive into Corfu town  and there are 2 tavernas  a supermarket and pharmacy within a short walk. A car is needed to travel around easily. Aqua land is very close by and worth a trip if you are that way inclined! The pool area of the villa is really great  and it’s lovely to drift off to sleep on the sunbeds whilst listening to all of the wildlife around you. Peter and Kostas are superb hosts  and are always on hand if needed  but never intrusive in any way. We have no hesitation in highly recommending this villa and are already looking forward to our next visit!
22682902,David June 2022 Great villa  had everything you need. Hire car is needed  then you have fantastic beaches within 20 mins drive  waterworld is 20 mins walk. village taverna 5mins walk and they are lovely people. Burger bar  supermarket (from meat to nappies) and ice cream/cake/coffee shop (ice cream was delicious) only 10 mins walk. plenty of day trips and all within 30 mins drive  then back to the pool. Would definitely come again. Peter was fantastic  places to go or eat

Villa is better than photos without a doubt  pool fantastic and whilst location is remote  there are great tavernas around  a supermarket  aqualand and bus & taxi within walking.  We had a great week. Would recommend Costas Taverna a short walk from villa for a great authentic Greek dinner. Also the Ambelonas Vineyard is about 30 mins walk away and is well worth a visit - stunning food and great wine at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend staying here. 10/10
22682902,Annet July 2020 The villa is very beautiful and it's location is practical. It's a spacious villa (inside and outside) and a relaxing place to enjoy a vacation.

5263938,Marian July 2021 Grigori’s place is simply amazing! Everything is thought for you to spend the most relaxing and exciting vacation! We had a two room apartment which is big and the begging is very good quality. The rooms are at shadow and it doesn’t get hot inside during the day. The kitchen and bathroom are exactly what is needed ( although there are also some good restaurants on the beach : check Spyros  simply delicious). The best of all are the people : we met Grigoris and Eleni  his mom  the most wonderful and welcoming people. Thank you again for our amazing vacation!

5263938,Philipp August 2018 A super nice place  with a nice view over the sea  the beach in walking distance and a very friendly host.
5263938,Shami August 2018 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Maistro apartments. The apartment was very clean and well organised  and had everything needed for a comfortable home from home holiday. The air con was a blessing and made cooking in the evenings a relaxing pleasure. The location is great  only a 4 minute walk to Pelekas beach which easily caters for every age group. There is a choice of restaurants to eat in  water sports and inflatable activities for all ages  sunbeds and umbrellas available if you don’t have your own  and beautiful clear water which is fantastic for swimming  snorkelling and playing in. On the way back to the apartment there is a small well stocked supermarket for all your daily needs.  The apartment is a good base to explore other areas of the island. From the top of the hill there is a regular bus service to Corfu Town. From there you can take to bus to anywhere you like. Car hire is recommended as it does give you more flexibility.  The key selling point of Maistro apartments is the hospitality. Grigoris and his family looked after us incredibly well. Grigoris took us to a large supermarket on our first day so we could stock up with essential items. He gave us lifts to the top of the hill so we could catch the bus to Corfu Town  put us in touch with a car hire company  and organised a birthday cake for my son. He also gave us general tips and advice on the island. We can’t thank him enough for his kindness and generosity. Show more
5263938,Judith July 2015 Our stay with Grigoris was magnificent. He was extremely warm and generous  helping us get to his house  sharing his love for the island  opening up his exquisite apartment which had every thing you might need. The view of the sea  short walk to the sea  wonderful porch were lovely. We felt welcome   cared for  and very grateful for the hospitality of him and his family. Next time  we will stay much longer Many thanks.
5263938,Bernhard July 2019 The apartment is spacious and very clean. It is additionally cleaned in between and the bed linen  as well as the towels  are changed. The terrace has an amazing sea view.

26626389,Allen September 2022 Our stay at Alesandro's place in Kokkini was lovely......his top floor apartment there in the village was perfect for a quiet  view-filled stay off the beaten track a bit.....it was a little tough to find  but worth the looking.....we highly recommend his place for a stay on Corfu....Allen & Kathy  Boise  Idaho  USA
26626389,Amaia September 2022 It's been a pleasure for us to stay in Alexandro's place. Everything was just as expected! The views from the terrace are spectacular and communication with Alexandros was very easy!
26626389,Mohamed August 2022 Amazing host  clean place. the views were more than what we expected. Would recommend!!
26626389,Indrė August 2022 Great communication  hosting skills! Alexandros was really responsive and helping with everything  the place was really tidy and clean  had everything you need in the bathroom  kitchen  bedroom. The view from the balcony is stunning and the environment is enjoyable. The place is quiet and a bit distant  so to have a car or other vehicle is necessary. In total  best recommendations!
26626389,Laura July 2022 We had a really nice week at Alexandros apartment in Kokkini  everything was just as we wished! Unfortunately we didn’t had the ability to meet Alexandros in person nevertheless check-in and check-out was super easy and Alexandros gave us the opportunity to text or call him whenever we need something! Also he gave us some useful information about car rental and transfer for which we were very grateful. All in all we can recommend a trip to wonderful Corfu and a stay at Alexandros nice apartment.
26626389,Erik July 2022 The one word we had for our stay at Alexandros place was Magical. Was located in a beautiful small village a short car journey to multiple beaches and more. About the apartment  11/10! The view from the terrace was beautiful and the apartment was the perfect size for two people. Alexandros was also an terrific host. Nothing to complain about  the only note is that a car is neccesary for getting the most out of this gem.
26626389,Maria July 2022 Good place  but it's a little bit hard if you have a lot of baggage  because of the stairs. I was there with car and it was perfect because two good beaches Glifada and Kontagialos is 7/8 kilometers . and beautiful Corfu old town is 12 kilometers. But without car it will be hard. There is good Tavernas in Pelekas  5 kilometers from Kokini. If you have car everything is Ok. Thank you Alexandros!
26626389,Craig June 2022 We stayed for a week at Alexandros' studio  the view is fantastic and the perfect place to sit and have a drink after a day at the beach/exploring Corfu.  We rented a car (I highly recommend a car for this location) and we had no issues parking in the square below the studio  the locals were very friendly.  There is a small shop at the bottom of the hill to buy bottled water and other supplies. A 5 minute drive to the beautiful beach at Pelekas.  Would recommend 100%
26626389,Austra June 2022 Everything was great - we enjoyed our stay. Easy check-in and view was spectacular! Bonus -> free parking near house.
26626389,Jeff May 2022 Alexandros' rooftop studio was perfect for our holiday on the beautiful island of Corfu. It is located in a small village  which we much prefer to the busier tourist areas. We had a car (essential) and went out every day but had somewhere peaceful to return to. The location is quite central and was perfect for seeing the island. Parking was never a problem  we got a space in the square every night and the car is visible from the apartment. You can get to the coast within 15 minutes. The larger resorts and Corfu town are about 25 minutes away. Make sure you visit The Kaiser's Observatory in the next town for an amazing view of the island followed by a drink on the beautiful terrace of the mountain-top hotel. One word of warning  the stairs to reach the apartment are a little tricky. Getting our medium sized case up was a bit awkward. I wouldn't take a large case. Once you are used to it  it's fine though. All-in-all we had an amazing time and look forward to returning soon. Thanks Alexandros.
26626389,Stella April 2022 This apartment has everything you need for a wonderful stay I Corfu. The apartment is really well equipped and clean and the view from the big terrace is amazing! It is well situated in a calm little village with beautiful surroundings and lots to explore. I did really nice hikes to the nearest beaches small villages. I would definitely recommend this place!
26626389,Karin October 2021 A lovely place at the highest point of a lovely  sleepy town. Very clean & comfortable. Enjoyed the sunrise on the terrace  hearing singing from the church nearby. Would come again for sure.
26626389,Nikolett September 2021 We spent a wonderful time at Alexandros's place  he was helpful and friendly  the view was delightful and of course the apartment was clean and so cozy. I can only recommend this place  if you're looking for a peaceful apartment where you can rest  but in the same time the great beaches are still available from there.
26626389,Alexander September 2021 Nice flat  which is not too far from Kerkyra  but away from mass tourism. Everything is very clean and the size is ideal for 2 people. The kitchen is well equipped and has an oven and a large fridge. The roof terrace is a dream and you sit very nicely under the pergola. The nearest beaches Glifada and Mirtiotissa can be reached quickly by car. Alexandros is a great and very nice host who responds quickly to any questions.
26626389,Ezgi September 2021 Alexandros place is just incredible! It looks exactly like in the pictures and it super clean. The location is perfect. You can reach anything without any problem and have a quite location at the same time. We spend amazing evenings on the terrace with a breathtaking view! I would recommend this accommodation to anyone!
26626389,Hugo August 2021 If you are seeking a quiet  secluded place  this studio is the place to be! The terrace  which is up in the trees  offers a panoramic view on the hills and the valley  having dinner there is truly wonderful - especially since there is a barbecue. The room and kitchen are neat and well equipped. There are beautiful beaches nearby and Corfu town is only 20min away by car. Alexandros and Kathrin were very welcoming and available  they're great hosts! I definitely recommend this apartment.
26626389,"Maximilian August 2021 Everything is exactly as described (and i mean it). The Appartement was clean and had everything you could need. The view from the Appartement is absolutely amazing  we loved watching the sunset and to eat outside.  Alexandros is a very helpful host. He gave us a lot of information and helpful tipps for our stay and he answers very fast. Definetly deserves to be called ""Super Host"".  Kokkini is beautiful and calm  the people there are very friendly. Especially with the view it is a nice place to spend quiet calm evenings. For us  way better than some Tourist Hotspot.  Kokkini has a Bus Station  5 minutes from the Appartement  bus transfer is alright. We had a rental car  but ended up not using it that much. Instead we used the bus. Driving on the Island was pretty difficult for me  since everything is narrow and steep and i am not used to driving shift. I'm used to drive on my hunting grounds in the German forrest with my Truck  but driving here ist something else  maybe consider using other forms of transportation  or maybe you're just better drivers 😅. Be aware  Google Maps sometimes gives you directions to the Appartement which are not streets and end. The safe way (space for 2 Cars)to drive up is at the Taverna.  We had a beautiful stay on Corfu and are very happy we chose to stay at Alexandros AirBnB. Show more"
26626389,Bri August 2021 My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay at Alexandros’ apartment. We did not know much about Corfu but I read that most of the sandy beaches are on the west coast which is why we were looking for a place on the west side of the island. That being said  Alexandos’ apartment in Kokkini could not have been more perfect! The first 3 days we did not rent a car but Alexandros was very helpful and sent over the green bus schedule to us. This allowed us to take the bus to and from Glyfada beach (which was also an amazing recommendation from his listing). The bus stop was only about an 8 minute walk from the apartment. We could also take the bus to and from Corfu town. Once we had rented our car  which we also found through Alexandros (https://1carental.com) we were super well connected to everywhere on the island as well while staying in Kokkini. I definitely recommend this car company  too. There was also parking right below the steps to the apartment which was great. There is a very delicious bbq restaurant down below the apartment as well and the supermarket is about an 18 minute walk/3 minute drive away. Overall  I cannot recommend this place enough! The location  the terrace view  the helpful host and much more made our Corfu vacation one to remember. Thank you to Alexandros and to your family for the best stay ever! Show more
26626389,Freek July 2021 We had a great stay here with a beautiful view around the area! Alexandros gave us a warm welcome and the apartment was amazing and very clean. We really enjoyed our time here!
26626389,Giorgia July 2021 Alexandros’ apartment with its breathtaking view is the perfect solution for couples or friends exploring the west coast of Corfu. The terrace overlooking the mountain was unique! The apartment looks new and clean - AC works perfectly. Alexandros is a very kind host and helped us with everything we needed during our stay.  Definitely recommended :)
26626389,Sophie June 2021 We had an amazing stay! the place is super cozy and looks exactly like in the pictures. worth mentioning is also that because the appartment is on the very top of a small village located on a hill  you get a nice breeze and it doesn't get too hot  which is a true blessing in the night!! it's also super private and quiet at night and you can see so many stars! 🤩 very romantic! walking down from the hill there is a small supermarket and a cute little tavern. Alexandros was a very friendly host and lives just downstairs  so it's easy to get to him if you would need something. clear recommendation!!
26626389,Miguel October 2020 Such an amazing view from the terrace looking to the sunset in Corfu. Small studio on top floor with a few ups and downs.  UPS 4 stoves and a great bbq in the terrace (amazing view) A lot of extras which saves you some good money: foil and film rolls  charcoal for bbq and ignition tablets  mosquito repelent plug (such a basic need in Corfu!) Intimacy and parking space for rental car...  DOWNS We weren't able to turn the oven on when the roast was ready to go in (even tho bbq served us as plan B). Small indoor space with no other place to seat than the bed. Water pressure is low and no curtain - mess after every shower! Knives need sharpen up  so frustrating.  Overall  we'd indeed stay again - but there's other options in the north of the island with more space and a full kitchen. Show more
26626389,Olivia September 2020 I just loved my stay at sunset studio. It is the most beautiful spot  with the most incredible view over the hills to the ocean. It is a quiet and special spot. The studio itself was spotless and had everything I needed. Alexandros was super helpful and responsive even though I arrived late at night. The whole experience was flawless. Hope I can go back soon!
26626389,Michal September 2020 Nice and equiped rooftop apartment (highest place in Kokkini ;) for 2 persons  a cozy place for your holiday. The marvelous terrace with superb BBQ. Sometimes and on some spots the WiFi is weak. Kokkini is a peaceful old village; one of the most suitable places to start your everyday explorations of the island. The most beautiful beaches on Corfu are nearby. I recommend! Thank you Alexandros!
26626389,Samuel August 2020 Perfect location if you want to explore the island and visit different beaches  particularly in the west and north coasts. I rented a quad bike and had a fantastic week exploring the island. The terrace is beautiful! Alexandros is a kind and attentive host  highly recommend.
26626389,Sannamaija February 2020 Apartment was very clean and cozy. View from the big terrace was realy beautiful. You need a car or some vehicle here.
26626389,Edgaras October 2019 Very cozy house in a great location. Very easy to reach all the north and west side beaches from the apartment. You won't need to go through the busy streets in the city. I would definitely recommend Alexandros place for your holidays.
26626389,Alex September 2019 We had an amazong time at Alexandros' place. The place itself is exactly as displayed in the Photos  and the view from the terrace is awesome  especially during sunset. Alexandros and his father took care of all our needs  we felt very welcome. Hihgly recommended for a longer stay on Corfu.
26626389,Daniela August 2019 My husband and I stayed in Alesandro’s studio for 3 nights during August. Incredible terrace and very peaceful view of the surroundings. The studio is more than enough for 2 persons and it’s equipped with everything you need and more.  Thanks Alesandro!
26626389,Jake June 2019 Alexandro’s place was perfect for our stay. It was very clean  and had amazing views. The balcony is spacious and lovely. It really was amazing  thank you Alexandro! We appreciated the touches like the candles and the comfy green sun loungers. Made our stay in Corfu very enjoyable.
26626389,Raphael June 2019 Great host and super cool apartment with a view! Close to beaches and Corfu town
26626389,Max May 2019 We had a wonderful stay at Alexandros place in Kokkini. The small flat in the middle of Korfu  is a perfect starting point to plenty of beaches in Korfu and to Korfu city. The view over the valley was perfect as promised. Communication with Alexandros was good and prompt. It was a really relaxing trip.
26626389,Astrid May 2019 Alexandros is a very friendly and nice host. The appartment was comfortable and cosy. Thank you for a good time in Kokkini :)
26626389,Katharina April 2019 We had a great time in Kokkini. The apartment has a beautiful terrace with a great view of the landscape. Kokkini is a great location for exploring all of Corfu by car as it is in the center of the island. The apartment is clean and the kitchen has everything you need if you want to cook yourself.
26626389,Joschua April 2019 It was a great time! The location is so great. We definitely want to come back in a few years and when its summer! We had everything we needed and the people are very very friendly. Thank you for that great holiday. :)
26626389,Tessa October 2018 We had a great time in Corfu. The apartment is perfectly located for trips around the island by car. Beaches and restaurants are not far away. Alexandros provided us with info about everything and we got welcomed by his mother. The place is great for a couple to stay and the terrace is just amazing. The neighbors are very friendly. So are their dogs. :-)  We definitely recommend a stay in kokkini!
26626389,Fenna October 2018 Great apartment just in the middle of the island. Explored the whole island and could easily go to the city in the evenings. Clean apartment which was also cleaned another time during our stay. Awesome view in a nice small village.
26626389,Maximilian September 2018 The Appartment is located in a backyard of a small village in the centre of the island. Alexandros and his family took really good care of us and they are helpful anytime. Thea room was cleaned after a couple of days and we get new towels and bedclothes. Wen enjoyed the sunset while we had a barbecue on the huge patio. The beautiful beach of Glyfada and Mirtiotissa is not far away (10-15 Min.) by car.
26626389,Виктор September 2018 The house is located in a small peaceful village. It is well furnished  very homely and comfortable. A large terrace's got an incredible view and is equipped with a brick BBQ  which came in very handy during our stay. Alexandros and his parents are very hospitable and friendly people  who are there to solve any issue without delay. I highly recommend the place and willing to come back the next year.
26626389,Marius August 2018 The appartment was clean and comfortable though the big terrace with the amazing view was definitely the best part!
26626389,Roel August 2018 We really enjoyed the stay. The apartment (top floor  clean  comfy) has a roof terrace with an amazing view of Corfu island. Alexandros was really friendly and helpful  for example helped us arrange a scooter to get across the island. Cost of scooter is around 20-25 euros. We do recommend renting a car or scooter. The town of Kokkini is small  quiet and not touristy. There is one very nice taverne at the foot of the hill the town is built on (5 minute walk). By scooter it is a 20 minutes drive to the nearest beaches and towns. Overall a great apartment to have had as HQ while exploring the island. Thank you Alexandros!!
26626389,Nina August 2018 The apartments are located in a small village  about 6 km to the nearest beach. To the bus stop and a small tavern about 7 minutes walk. The apartments are perfectly clean  freshly renovated  the furniture is almost new  there is everything for cooking. From the huge terrace offers a stunning view. The presence of a car  a motorcycle is mandatory. Alexandros kindly agreed to settle us ahead of time. I was lucky enough to get acquainted with his beautiful parents. I highly recommend this place to stay.
26626389,Sam July 2018 A stunning  stylish home that is immaculately clean. Located close to beaches and is tastefully decorated and has an huge balcony with a very beautiful view of corfu to look out on when you eat at the outside table. The kitchen is extremely well equipped  has an excellent oven and cooker  fridge and freezer but could do with a kettle. The hosts regularly provided new towels  fresh bed sheets and cleaned the home and were very welcoming. More than worth the price and would definitely stay again.
26626389,Alessandra October 2022 We stayed in this apartment for 3 nights. It is located in a small town  mini market on the main road to reach it. You need the car if you want to stay in this apartment. There are spiral stairs to get to it  so it might be a little uncomfortable for travelers with big suitcases  but it would be worth it. Alexandros is very kind and available for directions to the apartment and in its management. I also asked Alexandros for directions to which company to support me for renting a car and his advice was really helpful. It is a very quiet country and rest assured for those looking to get out of the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Recommended! Translated from Italian  Show original
26626389,Laetitia September 2022 original accommodation with a beautiful terrace but disappointing regarding the quality of the bedding where you can smell the springs from the mattress  the shower that is fixed on the sink  not very modern  and the kitchen with few utensils to cook  old pans that stick for example  and there is a duvet missing when it is cool! Otherwise clean accommodation  pleasant terrace when the weather is nice. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Guillaume September 2022 Accommodation with all amenities  the terrace is just wow. In addition Alexandros is very responsive and did everything to facilitate our arrival and setup. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Daniel August 2022 Charming little apartment in the heart of Corfu island. Located in a valley with beautiful views of the mountains and in the distance  the sea. We recommend this accommodation for its excellent value but also for all the amenities available (excellent air conditioning and free parking spaces). Alexandros was very available and was able to guide us throughout our stay! However  a vehicle is essential to visit the island. We hope to be back! Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Philippe August 2022 Very nice apartment with a beautiful terrace and a great view of the village  the surrounding area and even the sea in the distance. We enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend Alexandros's place  as long as you are motorized. Translated from French  Show original
26626389,Jan July 2022 We enjoyed the apartment very much. Kokkini is a small idyllic place  located away from the tourist strongholds inland. It is therefore advisable to book a rental car  but the island can also be explored by bus. The bus stop is only a 5-minute walk from the property and the bus runs 6 times a day. The terrace is an absolute highlight. It was clean and tidy. The exchange with Alexandros worked smoothly  he was very accommodating. We would choose Kokkini and the apartment again at any time! Translated from German  Show original
26626389,Dominik June 2022 A simple  clean 1-room apartment with a large terrace and beautiful views. The narrow spiral staircase to the apartment is outdated and initially scared us a little. Our sensitive backs had a hard time getting used to the feather mattress. Alexandros was not on site  but the check-in and check-out were pleasant and straightforward. Alexandros always responded quickly and kindly. Best regards to Kokkini Translated from German  Show original Response from Alexandros June 2022 I apologize if the stairs of your house made you doubt its safety. I can guarantee you that it is completely safe  as you are only there for 6 years and you are maintained every year! I also apologize for the mattress of the bed if you are tired! It was my choice among thousands of mattresses to choose a classic spring mattress that you would recommend for hotels  and so far I have not had any customer complaints  but that does not mean that I do not understand that one mattress is not for all tastes.Regards Alex!

26626389,Aude May 2022 This place is a little slice of heaven with beautiful views and away from the tourist hustle and bustle. Having a car is a must to fully enjoy this accommodation and be able to navigate the island in complete freedom.

Alexandros is very responsive and available to give advice and directions on staying in this beautiful island! Looking forward to coming back! Translated from French  Show original

26626389,Lonneke July 2019 The apartment has a beautiful view and terrace. It was wonderful to sit here. I myself am quickly bothered by my back and the bed has bothered me a lot from my back this vacation. That was a small downside. Furthermore  the apartment is super clean. We found the shower a bit less as you have to hold it yourself and the jet is on the small side. The well of the shower also smells.  The location of the apartment is ideal if you want to discover the island from different sides. Everything is easy and quick to reach by car or scooter.  Alexandros is very hospitable and always ready to help. He responds super quickly and is very nice.  We had a good holiday in this apartment. Translated from Dutch  Show original

49837107,Uriel October 2022 The villa was explant  quiet with great view  fully equipped and convenient. We loved it. Leon and his team were very helpful and ready to solve any problem.
49837107,M October 2022 Please use the other message. Thanks
49837107,Joanne September 2022 We really couldn't fault anything (apart from the track  which has already been mentioned). The villa is beautiful  exceptionally clean and very well-equipped. The service while we were there was brilliant - regular towel and sheet changes and cleaning to a very high standard. The pool was beautiful and just the right temperature. There were plenty of tavernas within walking distance. We particularly liked Byron's and Piazza. We were also well placed to explore the island. Finally  everything was extremely well-managed by the property manager  Leon. He was so attentive and very quick to return any queries. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you!
49837107,Phoebe June 2022 Such an amazing location About 30-40 minutes from town but the manager happily arranged transfers Beautiful views never wanted to leave Great recommendations for local cuisine and beach only a short walk away
49837107,Howie May 2022 Stayed at the West villa in May 2022. Stunning villa in immaculate condition with amazing views of the ocean. Leon and George were excellent hosts and were quick to respond to any questions. The villa was also cleaned almost every day during our stay with pool also cleaned every few days. I would however highlight the hill to access the property is exceptionally steep  making it challenging to drive up with a full car. Also  note that the swimming pool does not have a shallow end  I am 5ft 9 inches and could stand on my tip toes at one end of the pool only. Therefore  extra caution is required if travelling with kids who are not yet able to swim. Overall  a lovely place to stay and I would recommend it  the place is stunning and excellent service provided throughout.
49837107,Stephanie May 2022 We really enjoyed our stayed at the house Leon and his team were very helpful. The Villa is very good maintained and view very beautiful. Also very nice bar a restaurant in the town. Surely recommend this place.
49837107,Anna May 2022 The house is beautiful (the best beds ever!)  the location is fantastic and the view is simply gorgeous. Communication with the owner and the level of service he provided was the best. We had a wonderful week here with our family of four boys (age 9-15)  would definitely recommend!
49837107,"Jane April 2022 All I can say is ""wow"" what a fantastic villa in an amazing location with stunning views across the ocean. The villa had everything you could possibly wish for and more. The service we received was outstanding  nothing was too much trouble with great communication from the team. Quite simply it gets little better than this with the best recommendation we can give being that we are definitely going back !!!"
49837107,Evigna September 2021 This is a beautiful and modern house with a fantastic pool and sea views. Anything you'd want is available  from sun chairs to BBQ grills  outdoor and indoor lounge area  equipped kitchen and mosquito nets for all windows! The communication was easy and fast and the welcome basket was very thoughtful. Definitely a place to stay for longer than just a few days! The only thing to know is that it's a steep uphill with the car  our super tiny car just barely made it (due to the weight of passengers  luggage and AirCon ;-) )
49837107,Maya September 2021 We were staying at this amazing villa 7 friends. We couldn't ask for more than this (its even better than the pictures). The host was super friendly  He took care of anything including a pickup from the airport and arranging a chef who cooked us greek meal. The view from the swimming pool is absolutely gorgeous  all is tidy and clean  the interior design is beautiful and the kitchen is fully aquipped. We will definitely come back!
49837107,Daniel July 2021 We (family of 4) really enjoyed our stay in this stunning villa. We appreciated the privacy enormously. We received the villa very clean and well maintained. The lovingly furnished villa made the stay perfect. Communication with the landlord was always straightforward and our questions were answered quickly. We enjoyed our vacation to the fullest and I can't report anything negative. I can recommend this villa 100%.
49837107,George July 2021 Beautiful villa with stunning sea view! It's brand new  comfortable and luxurious! The fully equipped kitchen is perfect for families with young children. The outdoor area with the large infinity swimming pool provides great view to the Ionian Sea from every point. Perfect place to relax. Highly recommended for families or group of friends.
49837107,Alex July 2021 This is a great villa which I highly recommend to everyone who can fit into 4 luxury bedrooms each with a bathroom of it's own. The house is brand new. architects and designers spend a lot of time figuring out how to make it beautiful for everyone. Everything is modern and yet very Greek. The views  the pool  everything was amazing. The host helped us with restaurant reservations. Top villa for the money. Great.
35058113,Sixing January 2023 Nina and her family are so nice and kind，and house is really lovely and clean，I think maybe I will come again in the October haha！
35058113,Nerija November 2022 It was amazing stay! The host Nina was very kind and thoughful. We got some stuff for breakfast and some local wine from Nina's dad. The house is very cute and has everything you need for your stay. The backyard and the view from it is spectacular..We felt like home. The restaurants and beaches are very close. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT! We hope we can come back soon❤️
35058113,Darren October 2022 Nina's place was AMAZING. She is the most incredible host and from start to finish  we felt so welcomed  comfortable  safe and happy staying in her place. Her welcome gift of homemade wine was so wonderful  but there was so much more. She had eggs  bread  juice  coffee  water  and so much more waiting for us  which was so much appreciated. We were so happy staying in her place  with many different options of tables  chairs  hammocks  and spaces ready for us to relax in  looking out over the Mediterranean. The space was so well-equipped  the bed so comfortable  the shower hot  the WiFi good  the place so clean  cozy and wonderful. We'd return in a heartbeat. Such an incredible place with such an incredible host!
35058113,Joe October 2022 Better than advertised!  Everything was perfect about the property  the photos dont do it justice. We arrived to a bottle of homemade wine (made by ninas dad).  Nina was very a great host  always making sure we were well catered for. During a storm the power went out and she arrived within 10 mins with her dad to fix the power. Would definitely reccomed this property.  Also  a car is handy getting to the beach and back.
35058113,Jule October 2022 We had a wonderful time at Ninas place. The garden is so lovely decorated and the view is breathtaking. We enjoyed every minute. Nina was always very helpful and caring. We absolutly recommend to go there
35058113,Mona October 2022 Such a great place. Nina is the most amazing and kind host  she made our stay so special. The house provides you with everything you need in a home away from home. It has a terasse and garden with great sea view  and beautiful surroundings like olive trees and the sweet village of Pentati with great restaurants. Thanks for everything!
35058113,Isaac September 2022 Nina’s place was so beautiful! It is a perfect place to have a getaway from the loudness of a busy city. Nina and her family were so amazing it was like being greeted by my own family. Very hospitable and good vibes all round ❣️❣️❣️. Nina left some homemade wine which was delicious! ‼️‼️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 can’t wait to come back soon! 🙂
35058113,Marko September 2022 Wonderful place and amazing family  we realy felt like we have holidays with extended family. Thank you so much for your hospitality and we will definitely come back..  Marko & Martina
35058113,Julia September 2022 We had a very enjoyable stay at Nina’s place and didn’t want to leave. It’s clean  fully equipped and the garden is so pretty with olive trees  lots of flowers and views of the sea and sunset. Nina is very friendly  attentive and helpful. A car is probably the best way to get around the area but there are some lovely tavernas and beaches within walking distance.
35058113,Catherine September 2022 Nina's place is in such beautiful place! There are wonderful sea views from the windows  the patio and the garden! The house is small and comfortable  with everything you need. The WiFi is good and I had good signal in the garden too. There are fans to keep the air moving  and excellent mosquito screens at all the windows and the door. She has thought of everything even providing anti-bug spray and slippers! She left us homemade wine and also food and coffee for the next morning  which was great! She gave us excellent advice about a lovely taverna and an amazing beach and we were able to pick peaches out the garden! It's definitely a place to have a hire car and the roads are a bit of an adventure  but we had a wonderful time and loved lying in the hammock looking at the amazing view! Nina helped us with all our queries and is so kind and attentive.
35058113,Gabriel August 2022 A very nice and romantic spot with a spectacular view of the see  in a quite surrounding. At first we were a little concerned about the distances to all major interest points of the island  but coming with our car made things a little easier. The roads to the property were not the best I've ever drove  but there were asphalt works in progress during our stay  so the things will surely be better for future hosts. Nina is a great host  doing her best to make you feel welcome and a great communicator. So  thank tou  Nina for fully contributing to my family's holiday success!
35058113,Luísa August 2022 After staying in Pentati last year  we had to come again to experience Nina’s wonderful hospitality and the easiness of being in this magical place. Everything is perfect  the location  the place  the food  the nature  but the best is Nina and her family. They make everything great and fun! We will come back as much as we can!
35058113,Daisy August 2022 We had a wonderful stay Nina is so lovely and helpful when we arrived there was homemade wine which was so good. We had fun at all the near by beaches and would recommend staying here (having a rental car is probably easier)
35058113,Elena July 2022 We really enjoyed two weeks we spent in Nina's house. It is exceptionally clean and comfortable and perfectly equipped so you don't suffer from mosquitos  heat nor anything else. I appreciated the bathroom - hot and cold water runs smoothly and it is well ventilated. The place is very private  the garden is safe for children. Nina is an amazing host  she is always available and helpful. The location is little populated  very calm. In the nearby village there are great tavernas and a shop and the beach is 5 minutes diving from the house.
35058113,Jessica May 2022 The place is beautiful and perfect for relaxing. Nina is a lovely person and always ready to help. Can only recommend it!!
35058113,Gordon May 2022 We had a lovely stay at Nina’s house  which is simple but perfect. We especially liked the garden  and the hammock and swinging chair  with their beautiful ambiance  and great views of the sunset. The house had everything we needed and more  and we enjoyed walking to Pentati  and it’s tiny  and in our experience empty  beach. We also liked Paranoma (sp?) Beach. And enjoyed both tavernas at Pentati and Paranoma - Angela’s was delightfully informal. Nina helped at every stage  and was always quick to answer questions and give advice.
35058113,Lena April 2022 We had a fantastic time. Nina is a great and caring host  from the start (helping us to get to the house from the airport) right to the end. We were welcomed with home made vine  into the clean nice little house with a extraordinary view from the terasse and even the bedroom window! Nina was available our whole stay and gave us great tipps for locations  hiking routes and places to go around the area. We're planning on coming back one day soon! Thanks for everything :-)
35058113,Jihee April 2022 Nina was a super host. We were contacting per whatsapp and she always reminded us that she‘s there for any help.  We were at corfu for few days just to rest  and ninas house suited us perfectly. Big garden with nice view of the ocean  the neighbours were very nice and friendly. Theres also a beach 10-15min away by foot. The only thing was that the wifi didn’t work very good  but you dont need it when you are there. Once again thank you nina for your welcoming :) hope to be there again.
35058113,Martina October 2021 We had the most awesome family holiday at Nina‘s place. The hospitality of the Greek people is outstanding. The family of Nina gave us not only a very beautiful Place to stay  also their friendship and life stories. We will never forget the experience of having a home away from home. The place is amazing to chill out  the view of the ocean is magical and the wine tasty. 15/10 points and more - I recommend going to Corfu and staying at this hotel place at least once in a lifetime.
35058113,Anne Christine October 2021 Wonderful view from a beautiful garden
35058113,Luísa August 2021 Like visiting a friend  staying at Nina’s place feels like being at home away from home. Me and my family were welcomed with generous warmth that made our stay memorable. All details were taken care of  from umbrellas for the beach to mosquito bites treatment. Nina and her family are professional hosts  looking after the people they welcome in an outstanding manner  but they do it in such a natural way that you can’t help but falling in love with the place  the people  the food. This is a jewel location for families that want to escape the busier parts of the island and have a true local experience with the benefits of the modern times. There’s nothing that can be improved we just hope Nina keeps her house open so we can go back next year!
35058113,Katharina August 2021 Our stay was amazing! The scenery is beautiful with seaview and Chillout area under the olivetrees! The communication was also very pleasent! Thank you Nina for all the speacial information and for having us!!
35058113,Lauren August 2021 Nina is possibly the most wonderful host I've had yet with airbnb. Extremely helpful and friendly. She even found out the age of our baby which we realised was to leave us some nappies for her in the correct size! She had really thought of everything. The place is absolutely beautiful  the garden is stunning  covered in olive trees  plants and beautiful flowers and has a sea view which can be enjoyed from the rocking chair on the patio  the table  the hammock  the swing or the chair swing - paradise! We will definitely only consider staying here when we go back.
35058113,H July 2021 What an amazing place to stay on Corfu. The fist thing you have to know is the spectacular view from the lovely garden with al it’s flowers  old olive trees. Great view at the blue sea en mostly every day sunset. It’s quite and we loved it. Big private garden with hangmat  cosy chairs and tables. The house had everything you need and is very well equipped. It is a traditional small house big enough for two people. And than we have Nina! She is so helpful with everything. She answers directly en is so kind and friendly. Highly recommended! If we have to point out what we missed is maybe the airco. The ventilators where good so we didn’t miss it. And we find out Greek people like quit hard beds.
35058113,Livia July 2021 Nina is a great host  she was totally helpful for every need and question we had and her place is simply amazing: the garden ist wonderful to enjoy the fresh wind from the see and incredible sunsets  the house is tiny but completely equipped with all you can need on holiday and even more. We would be happy to spend some days at Nina's again  thank you!
35058113,Teresa June 2021 We had an amazing time at Mantzaros Traditional House! It is a wonderful place. Even more beautiful than the pictures can tell. It is peaceful  calm  cozy and has a very beautiful view. We had everything we needed and even more. Nina is such a lovely and caring host. Thank you very much  Nina  we are very glad to meet you and your lovely family. We are looking forward to visit you again soon! Response from Nina June 2021 Tereza and Daniel were a great couple. Very polite. So excited when they got home. We had very nice communication.Great people.
35058113,Alena June 2021 We had the Most beautiful stay at Nina’s place  the house an garden designed with lots of love and it’s very well-equipped  you’ll have everything you need  even games for the beach! The area is quite  a 20 minute Walk or 5 minute drive through olive gardens to the small village Pentati. Beaches in the area were not crowded at all  it was the perfect Place to escape city crowds and noises. Nina and all of her family are very nice hosts who are always available to give recommendations about beaches and tavernas in the area. Her dad makes the tastiest honey wine. Thank you very much!!!
35058113,Carmen June 2021 Everything is perfect. Authentic greek house in the middle of an olive forest. Two nice beaches 5' by car. The house has all kind of comodities   Many things for breakfast and nice garden. Nina is wonderful : helpfull  friendly and with very easy comunication. Also her father who we made fun with. Taberna CHRIS PLACE near Nina's is a wonderful recommendation to eat. Response from Nina June 2021 Carmen and Maria are two great friends with very positive energy! Their Mediterranean tamperament contributed to a beautiful communication! I would like to host them again during a new covid free season !
35058113,Alessandra June 2021 We stayed one week at Nina‘s magical place and had wonderful vacations with the most beautiful sunset from the garden. The place is very calm located between olive trees and the sea. In the house we found everything (even more) we needed in that time. Nina prepared some stuff for the first breakfast and cared for us the whole stay very well. She had always good advices for trips also she was aviable for us the whole time at whatsapp. Her father came around  we had some nice talks  he welcomed us with homemade wine and we could order some of the best Fish we ate - with some cooking advices on top. We are so thankful we could stay in that little place of heaven on earth and met Nina and her lovely Family. Thank you so much for everything 🌷 Response from Nina June 2021 Semir and Alessandra were amazing guests  a beautiful young couple  we had nice communication. I would be very happy to host them again .
35058113,Miriam May 2021 We have been there for 2 weeks with 2 little kids. We had such a great time. The house is cozy and especially the garden is amazing! The view is spectacular and the kids could play safely.  While there are many tourists at the rest of corfu  this area is very quiet  But the best is nina and her family. They are so nice. They brought fresh fishes and octopus and homemade wine.  Totally recommendable!
35058113,Lukasz August 2020 Do not go there. Do not build another hotel! Just leave this place as it is 😀 Calm with nature. Wish more places were like this one. Nina is super host! Big up!
35058113,Dmitrij August 2020 Me and my gf had an amazing stay at Nina`s house. This house and area is perfect for those people  who like peaceful and authentic vacation. It is away from tourists  loud city noises and similar things  which may steal your peace. It is located between Pentati and Paramonas villages (or even small towns  with local people) in olive forest  with stunning coast and mountain view. Therefore you`ll be able to try amazing traditional Greek food  hear beautiful singing from Church while walking in the evening in Pentati. -> I`d recommend to visit Angela`s taverna. Big beaches are also not far away  only about 15 min. ride by car: Paralia Agios Cordios and Paralia Paramona (Paramonas beach). We traveled by car and within 5 days we were able to see most of the Corfu. Nina`s house has absolutely everything you may need during your stay. It is very clean and was above any expectations. Nina was very kind and thoughtful  we arrived in the late evening and she bought some food for us to eat  as well as bottle of vine  which her father produces locally. You may also order fresh seafood from Nina  as her dad runs a fish store :) We bought and cooked some fresh prawns  which were delicious. I`d highly recommend that option. Nina`s father visited us as well  told us the story of the village  farm itself. We had a great talk  he is a wonderful person with generous heart.  Nina was very responsive to answer our questions and guide us  she was always online per WhatsApp to send us locations and tips. We had clean sheets and towels the whole time. There is a big area in front of the house (garden) just for you  at night you can lay down into hammock with a glass of vine  relax  listen to the sea and look at the shore in the moonlight. <3  My only advice/tip for visitors would be to rent a good car  as Corfu is a mountainous terrain in general. :)  We`d definitely like to come again and 100% recommend this amazing place of Nina`s.  Best wishes  Show more
35058113,Amelie August 2020 Nina‘s house is everything is says in the description and more. The house itself is small but cozy  fully equipped  and completely spotless. From the hammock and swing in the backyard you can watch the sunset with a glass of wine that Nina‘s father made himself. The area is perfect for anyone who wants to get away from masses of tourists. Everyone in the area knows and helps each other and we felt incredibly at home. I‘d recommend renting a scooter (at Nina‘s best friend‘s place) since the house is sort of in the middle of nowhere  but even if you don‘t  there are still beautiful beaches you can walk to. I think Nina is the best host I‘ve had in my life. She helped us rent the scooter  answered any question immediately  called a supermarket to check at what time they‘d open (since it was a holiday)  and even dropped us off at the airport. I can‘t recommend her place enough and I will definitely be back one day.
35058113,Agata July 2020 This place is special. You can really relax there. The house is cosy and equipped with everything you need and more. The view from the olive grove surrounding the house is outstanding. If only I could  I'd like to come there every year. And Nina is the kindest and most caring host I have met on Airbnb.
35058113,Mag March 2020 Nina's place was great. Nina and her family made us feel like home. We highly recommend this place!
35058113,Daniel October 2019 Perfect spot for a quiet getaway in a less frequented corner of the island. The house is small yet absolutely cozy and has everything you need  with a spacious terrace perfect for yoga and an even more spacious garden of olive trees  shady enough to keep cool but still offering a perfect view. Nina is absolutely amazing and thoughtful  she provided us with all kinds of useful things from mosquito repellent through binoculars to a sewing kit. The kitchen was equipped with basic spices and the fridge had some starter food in it. Anything we asked for  she provided in an instance. She regularly inquired about our wellbeing but without being pushy or intruding on our privacy. Highly recommended!
35058113,Peter September 2019 Nina is very kind  the house is really nice  clean and well-equipped. The view from the garden is amazing. Absolutely recommended  if you plan to rent a car.
35058113,Tonka September 2019 Nina's place is a little hidden treasure. As we had no gps  we took some time to find the place  but Nina gave us instructions and came to pickus up. The house is tiny  and is equipped for a self-catering holiday. The house is so well isolated that it kept cool on hot days too and the ceiling fans are effective. The olive garden is very nicely arranged  with seating and resting equipment and flowers. We liked watching the sunset from the terrace or the garden. Nina is a fantastic host  caring and relaxed. You need a car to access this place  but once there the village (for shopping and restaurants) and the beaches are close driving. There are also some interesting tourist spots close-by. There is safe free private parking at the house. We gladly recommend Nina's place.
35058113,Christian August 2019 We had a really nice time in this well equipped and very clean accommodation. This calm place with a great view over the sea is a good place to calm down and relax. We enjoyed the shadow in garden with the hammocks so much. As it is located in the middle of the western coast  we could easily discover the north and the south of Korfu (with our scooter/Vespa). Swimming and snorkelling was possible and really nice in the bays nearby (by Vespa). Nina is a great host and was disposable for all our questions and needs. She even invited us to a church celebration where we danced Sirtaki together and ate traditional greek food. We can definitely recommend to stay at Nina’s place.
35058113,Vinca August 2019 The first reason you have to choose this house in Corfu is to have the chance to meet its amazing owner  Nina  as well as her family. Nina is an exceptional person whose generosity is only matched by her cheerfulness. It's also someone you can truly rely on during your stay as I have experienced it! In short  the best possible host! And I thank her a thousand times for her hospitality. The small house in the middle of an olive grove is charming  very clean and well equipped. The outside is all the charm with the large terrace and hammocks at the end of the field with a magnificent view of the sunset. We stayed a week and we made every day very beautiful discoveries all around the island. Take care Nina & see you soon! 😊
35058113,Ted August 2019 Mother and daughter had a wonderful peaceful stay at Mantzaros House. Sparkling clean with all the touches of home overlooking incredible views of ocean and coastline. Nina and her family were kind and generous hosts and We felt so lucky to have met them. A true local experience in an authentic natural environment of Corfu. You definitely need a car. We hope to return some day. This is a really beautiful special place run by hosts who really care their guests have a positive experience.
35058113,Nicholas July 2019 Easily the best host I have ever experienced with an Airbnb stay. Nina was so hospitable and made our stay incredible. We felt very safe  welcome and at home the whole time. I wish every host could match Nina!!!!! Thank you so much. I definitely recommend to anyone wanting an amazing stay in Corfu :)
35058113,Andy July 2019 A beautiful corner of traditional Corfu  off the beating track so download directions to your sat nav beforehand as reception can be spotty on the way. Angela's taverna up the road is great and there's everything from beaches to supermarkets a short drive away.
35058113,"Zoli July 2019 This house has an amazing view of the sea  we had great breakfasts there. The house is very close to ""Pentati"" a lovely village with 2 best restaurants of Corfu. You need a car  but it definitely worth it  the host is very kind and helpful with everything! :)"
35058113,Annakarin June 2019 We stayed for one week and we really loved the place. It's quiet and beautiful with an astonishing view over the sea. The house was perfect for us (two adults and one little child)  it had everything we could need and it was perfectly clean. The garden was wonderful. We had all meals outside  in the shadows of the olive trees. We enjoyed the hammocks so much  watching the sea and the sunset. During our visit the plums in the garden where ripe  sweet and delicious! There is a private parking place in the garden (you will need a car). Nina is the sweetest and most helpful host I have ever met. She received us so well and made everything she could to make our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible.  About the surroundings: Pentati village is a very nice  calm and picturesque village  with a very cute minimarket with a terrace  and the charming and tasty restaurant Angela's. There are many nice beaches nearby.  I can highly recommend this place to travelers who want something less touristic  close to the nature  calm and romantic. Show more
35058113,Marc November 2022 Super nice location and property. The house has absolutely everything you need and Nina is the most helpful and friendly hostess you could ask for. Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Andreas October 2022 This house has everything you need and is well equipped. Here you can nest in for three weeks and would not need to leave the house  but who wants that on vacation? Everything is very lovingly decorated  both in the house and in the garden. Nina takes care of everything in an abundance and loving way. The only reason I have to take a star off is because unfortunately you do not have evening sun when you come home from the hiking tours or swimming afternoons  as the house and garden are completely embedded under ancient olive trees. In high summer probably awesome  but not in October. Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Laurence August 2022 It's an extraordinary garden with sea views  a little piece of paradise maintained by Nina and her parents... The welcome is just as perfect   Nina is very present if needed and attentive...Thank you for a lovely week Nina   we hope to come back ... it was great. Laurence and Alain Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Alexis August 2022 The place  the garden  the view  the location  everything is wonderful. Nina's welcome is very kind  she is lovely. The area is worth it  it is some of the most unspoiled in Corfu. Our stay was perfect. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Emmanuelle July 2022 We had a great time at Nina's place! The house is very nice and what to say about the garden and the sea view which is beautiful! Although it is not far from a road it is very quiet  well-equipped  super efficient fans keep the house cool  we slept very well. Nina gave us good advice for restaurants and a great beautiful beach not far from the house. She booked for us because the WIFI is a little finicky and our phones sometimes had trouble working...  Nina had planned small gifts on arrival and breakfast supplies...we can only recommend NIna's house. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Anne-Marie July 2022 Our stay at Nina's was beautiful and magical.  The House: Very clean. You're all caught up. There are screens on the windows and doors  from fans to the ceiling. When we arrived (late)  we were happy to find everything we needed for our next-day breakfast in the fridge. A lovely welcome gift awaited us. The beds were made and the towels nicely folded.  The terrace and garden: One word  magic! The terrace  with its table and chairs  is beautifully decorated with plants. There is a rocking chair to enjoy the sea view and rest. The garden is magical. It is a true olive grove with a hammock  swing  hanging chair. Under the sound of cicadas  you can admire the sea. There is an enchanting view  especially at the end of the day  where you can admire the sunset each night. We didn't miss any of them! This was the mandatory end of day appointment! You can park the car easily. Pentati is a short drive away. There's a great hostel where Nina's sister works. We ate here several nights happily every time. Thanks to Sophia  the lovely and kind waitress.  And there's Nina and her family: Nina went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. She's so thoughtful  and you can tell she and her family love to host. She was able to advise us  was considerate. Thanks again to everyone we met for their hospitality and kindness. Especially Nina's dad who gave us grilled fish and wine  thank you for the good stories and also thanks to his wife.  Thank you for your smiles  good humor  thoughtfulness and kindness. We won't forget you.  It's the big heart that we left.  See you soon Nina  I hope.  Anne-Marie  Juliet and Nicolas:-) Show more Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Patrick June 2022 This place is just amazing! The house offers everything you need  the garden is pure nature and the view of the sea is breathtaking! Hostess Nina and her parents are just adorable and warm. Absolutely recommended! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,"Petra June 2022 We stayed in this beautiful place for 12 days! I agree with all previous positive reviews! Nina is really a very warm host and always trying to make it as beautiful as possible for you. Always available  responds very quickly  has good tips for excursions and taverns. The garden with hammock and hammock chair is a treat and the sunsets from there are really a dream! The house is small  but nice! Clean and everything you need available. The terrace of us is used a lot to eat and sit together. Car essential in my opinion. Streets also partly adventurous on the island - potholes and narrow streets  but you get used to them. Beaches not within walking distance  but by car/scooter no problem  few minutes. Supermarket similar. There are several taverns within a few minutes. The area is much less ""lit up"" by tourists compared to other corners of Corfu. Which we found very pleasant and had hoped for. Translated from German  Show original"
35058113,Lisa May 2022 The small cozy cottage with a beautiful view leaves nothing to be desired. The terrace is wonderful and you have the perfect view of the sunset. Nina is a wonderful host who is always available for questions and tips. We felt very comfortable in the 2 weeks:) Clear recommendation! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Sabine April 2022 If you want to have it quietly  you love to watch the sun sinking between up to 1000-year-old olive trees  this is the place to be. Nina is a host who is with all her heart to her guests  always and at any time. The apartment is really equipped with EVERYTHING you need. The fridge was already full and there was homemade wine.  We actually never travel to the same place a second time.... so far 😀 Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Gilles April 2022 The garden and its stunning sea views are the major asset of this accommodation. We really enjoyed the hospitality and availability of Nina and her dad. We felt like it was people who love to host and connect. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Michel April 2022 The stay exceeded our expectations. The house is lovingly and very tastefully decorated. Nothing is missing. The garden also keeps what the pictures promise. A gigantic view  a variety of plants and lush greenery. Nina was an excellent host. We were received very warm and friendly  even the fridge was filled with all kinds of things (eggs  bread  milk  juice  cornflakes and croisannts & spread). I was there with my 4 year old son for a getaway. The garden is absolutely safe and small explorers find plenty of space here. The nearest beach is a few minutes' walk away and if you want to go a little further  Nina has the right tips. I'm sure we'll be back! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Lydia August 2021 Nina was a super host  we were welcomed with wine and a full fridge. She gave us numerous tips  was always available. Her parents gave us fresh fish. The house is fantastically located  directly above the sea  you have your peace  yet come quickly to Pentati or to the Paramonas Beach  in 30 minutes you are in Corfu city. We recommend renting a car or a Vespa. Overall  a perfect place to unwind!👍👍👍 Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Hakim July 2021 We loved our stay at Nina's home! We were blown away by the beautiful garden and the sea view. It is a real haven of peace that we couldn't wait to find after visiting the various tourist sites during the day. All the must-see places in Corfu are very easily accessible from the house by car. On foot  you can also access various very charming and intimate beaches. Nina and her father went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. We loved talking to Nina's father who regularly brought us his homemade wine. He also brought us some freshly caught shrimp and fish and helped us prepare them. We absolutely don't regret our choice and hope to come back soon ! Translated from French  Show original
35058113,"Louis July 2021 As soon as we arrived  we were seduced by the bohemian style of the garden. Nina gave us a tour and explained the place as well as everything she had prepared for our first breakfast to be great. Nina told us about the places for the beach  groceries and meals at the taverns ( I recommend Angela). The whole house is filled with provisions  utensils  unimaginable things that can help ""just in case."" What to expect. The view is magnificent under the sound of cicadas. We went to the tavernas and the beach on foot via romantic paths. Translated from French  Show original"
35058113,Jean June 2021 This is really a beautiful place  everything is top notch. Nina and her family are very welcoming. The village next door is very pretty  the sea nearby and it's also wow! A great place to stay and visit the rest of the island. Translated from French  Show original Response from Nina July 2021 Wonderful couple with their little daughter Loulou. We had beautiful communication.would gladly host them again.
35058113,Fabian October 2020 Beautiful and lovingly furnished cottage with a wonderful garden. There you can have a good breakfast and look at the sea. The accommodation includes everything you need. Even the fridge was stocked with food items by Nina for the first breakfast. We also got two bottles of their delicious wine. Since we were at home at her place for a total of 11 days  she brought us fresh towels and changed the bedding halfway through the time. All in all  Nina is an extremely enthusiastic and caring host!  The property is suitable for people who like it quiet and secluded. The nearest place (Pentati)  where there are two tasty taverns  is 2 5 km away from the property. That is why and because the accommodation is rather remote  we advise you to rent a rental car. This allows you to explore the island well. We thank Nina and felt very comfortable in her accommodation and on the beautiful island of Corfu! Translated from German  Show original

35058113,Pascal October 2020 Nina is an exceptional host we were hosted terribly  with great care. Everything was there to start our stay  the well-stocked fridge  wine made by her dad  and a lot more that we have never seen anywhere else. We stayed for 1 month  Nina was always attentive to make our stay as pleasant as possible. She brought us fish to grill  wine and a lot of little things to make us happy. We had the chance to meet her family   very endearing people and despite the language barrier we had unforgettable moments with them. Nina's house wonderfully matches what we're looking for. Far from the tourist resorts  a haven of peace with crazy charm tranquility and magnificent views of the west coast of Corfu. And as a bonus  magnificent sunsets each night. Neighborhood is a beautiful island very green we were able to see all aspects of the island. What to say plus  everything was perfect. Contrary to our habit of never going back to the same place  we'll go back. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Frank September 2020 Fantastic house including garden with magical view! Super nice and thoughtful hostess! Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Lidia July 2020 Nina's incredible hospitality  running across the street from every need  made our stay extra comfortable. The place is beautiful  the photos don't capture its charm. The home is secluded  so it's convenient to have a car (it's affordable to rent at the airport). Nina thought of everything from Covid 19 fluids and disinfectant wipes  through welcome wine  first breakfast products  to cosmetics and even pads! It was clean and lovely everywhere. I recommend it sincerely for those who like peace and quiet. Translated from Polish  Show original
35058113,Léo Nico July 2020 It is close to the small village of Pentati  standing on its centuries-old cliff that you will find at the turn of a snake road: Nina's small house. Nestled in a green setting where the olive trees mingle on which cicadas lounge  you will find the house at the turn of a small path that leads to the large terrace. There you will be welcomed by Nina  who for us  despite a late hour  opened her door to us with a smile like the island: warm. The house is not big  but everything is there to feel good. Whether it was for the different rooms that make up it or for the multiple touches left on site by our host (Nina was kind enough to buy us something to have breakfast the next morning). When we first woke up  the enchanting continued realizing that the garden overlooked the Ionian Sea. Going up to a small table in the shade of the olive trees you will reach one of the most beautiful views of the house: a gazebo that overlooks part of the west coast of the island  here you can dream the cliffs dip in the Mediterranean and hear in the early morning and for the rest of the day: the melody of the waves. Nearby  a 15-minute walk  you can walk along the uncrowded road that leads down to a small stone path down into a small fishing port. There you can swim in the turquoise waters of Corfu island. And if you're lucky  just like us  maybe the beach is yours for a swim. Nina  since the beginning  has always made it easy for every part of our trip  and I'm sure  one of the keys to her success. So I can't recommend your stay at her place enough  because the house is just like the person: welcoming  warm and caring. Thank you for this stay  and we hope so: see you soon.

35058113,Sonja November 2019 Nina is a super host! She picked us up cigar from the airport and drove us there! If you had any questions  she was immediately available and gave you all the information you need! The house is super nice  well equipped and has a great location. You could easily reach everything with a rental car and also on foot. There were wonderful holidays we spent there we can only recommend it and would want to stay there again any time if we come to Corfu again! Best wishes Sonni and Tanja Translated from German  Show original
35058113,Damien September 2019 Nina's place is very nice  very quiet and pretty well located for visiting the south of the island. The equipment is of very good quality and it has everything you need for a pleasant stay. Nina is very friendly and present if needed. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Chloé September 2019 Nina's house and her garden under the olive trees with sea views are really more than charming  the very warm welcome  the house with everything you need in it. Nina gave us a small deserted beach address right next to the house  brought wine made by her father  we were also able to have fish and octopus to grill on the barbecue. In addition  nature is beautiful and this corner of Corfu remains sheltered from resorts. We highly recommend this rental and these perfect hosts! Thank you very much. Translated from French  Show original
35058113,Iris June 2019 A beautiful holiday home with a large garden and fantastic views. If you are looking for a quiet place to feel good  this is the place to be. Nina was an attentive host  was always available for us and we felt very comfortable. Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Frederic October 2022 My best experience with Airbnb! Crazy place  2 meters from the sea! All the commodities to kitchen  to rest and to listen radio / watch TV . Very quiet place  5 minutes from the village.
576002487041317086,Ragi September 2022 Axilleas cottage is a little dream come true! We had the best time there  everything is like you see it in the pictures and the description. If you’re looking for a place to relax and forget the world - then this is your spot to go. He welcomed us with fruits and self made wine and was every time available. The little dog and the cats are all well educated and are just adorable. If we’re ever going to Korfu again  we’re definitely going again to Axillea and this beautiful place.
576002487041317086,Franziska September 2022 Axilleas’ place truly is a little paradise. Somewhat hidden offside the road and with the Mediterranean right in front of the doorstep (not exaggerating!)  it is the perfect getaway if you’re looking to rest. The little stone cottage might look small from the outside  but feels bigger once you’re inside  and offers practically everything you need…fridge  stove  coffee machine  shower  wardrobe  a tv set (which feels somewhat redundant)  etc. Axilleas will often be in the neighboring shack  do his thing without ever disturbing you. He’s a paramount example of friendliness and always quick to help if help is needed.  The cottage is literally in the middle of nowhere  with the nearest (and very commendable) taverna being a 20-minute walk  and the next supermarket an estimated 45-minute walk away. We recommend renting some sort of motorized vehicle to be mobile. We rented a little quad at the taverna  paying €80 for the 3 days and it turned out to be the best decision as you wouldn’t want to schlep all the bottled water from the supermarket. We used the tap water twice to brew coffee and it didn’t kill us or anything  but it’s definitely no drinking water. We recommend shopping at Lidl as it is far less expensive than the Masoutis supermarket which is slightly closer to the cottage. (Masoutis has oat milk tho)  Some advice on top: Best bring some earplugs  as the rushing sea can be quite irritating at times  the more so if you’re a light sleeper. The fridge unfortunately adds to it. It’s not awfully loud all in all  but it’s there for sure. And if you have a well-tried mosquito remedy  bring it with you. We used Autan and it didn’t help. At all. Corfu is rich with midges (mini mosquitoes) that usually swarm out around sunset. And they’re merciless. Also worthy of note: if you stand taller than 180cm or 5’9  you might struggle with the short bed frame. It’s wide enough for two  but your feet will definitely have to come to terms with the foot of the bed.  But all of the above mentioned shouldn’t keep you from booking this gem. If you need a timeout from the hasty everyday world  this is where you get it. We’re planning to come back next year for sure.  Big thank you to Axilleas for being such a sweet and helpful host and just a great person overall. Show more
576002487041317086,Bibiana August 2022 The little house is very beautifully located  directly by the beach and in a quiet area. There are only a few other houses close by and you can enjoy your stay completely undisturbed. The water is super clear and it is also a great spot for collecting shells and snorkeling. If you have a reantal car  you can also easily reach some supermarkets/stores or restaurants. Axilleas also showed us how to fish for razor shells  which we successfully did and then were able to cook for dinner. All in all  we would have loved to stay longer and would definitely recommend this accommodation for everyone who is looking for a quiet place to relax  enjoy the time by the sea and just forget about their daily routine.
576002487041317086,Charlotte August 2022 Axilleas' place was the highlight of our trip. The studio was perfect  and the beach was amazing. We drove to a few different beaches around Corfu but found the one just outside where we slept to be the best. We got there at night time and woke up to the most spectacular sunrise over the ocean that I have ever seen - felt like a dream! Axilleas and his friend welcomed us and were very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here.
576002487041317086,Yu August 2022 We stayed here for three days and we loved it so much. This is something really unique. It is in a quiet place  with the forest on one side and the sea on the other. It's so close to the sea that you can literally jump in and swim at any time. This beach is great for swimming  and it's your own piece of the sea! We enjoyed swimming at different times  watching the sunrise and sunset in the sea  and blowing the sea breeze in the porch. . . and watch the orange moonset! The room is also lovely. It has everything necessary. You can cook your own meals  order meals  or drive to eat nearby. Axilleas offered his own olive oil and wine! We made our nice salad. Anyway  we are so happy to find this place and hope to visit it again next year.
576002487041317086,Haddy July 2022 Wow wow wow! This place is like heaven on earth. We were given olive oil and wine that the host had made himself. As we checked in Axeillas was there catching mussels and he was so friendly and gave it to us  which went perfectly with our pasta that we prepared. He is also more than happy to show you how to catch them. The area is very quite  which is very relaxing. You also have access to basic things like towels  goggles  pool mattress  coffee tea  salt pepper sugar  things to prepare food to cook and even a wooden boat at your disposal. On another night we decided to grill some fresh fish  which was also very cozy with the private beach and amazing views of mountains. We will never forget our stay in this place  it was nothing but wonderful!!! Thank you Axeillas for providing us a lifetime memory and the best Airbnb ever.
576002487041317086,Lejla July 2022 We can just confirm the other reviews and say when you are there it is even better than described and expected. Axilleas is a great host. He welcomed us with fruits  self made olive oil and wine. He even picked us ip  because we could not find the right turn to the cottage. The cottage is recently renovated  its well equipped with everything you need and perfectly located directly at the beach. The mornings and evenings there are amazing and our daughter loved playing with the dog. We loved staying at this airbnb!
576002487041317086,Robert July 2022 Axilleas is an excellent host and We had great time in his beach-house. Its a very quiet place  little paradise right at the beach with everything you need for relaxing vacation. If you are planning to visit some tourist attractions or public beaches of Corfu  be sure to plan your trips in advance with some schedule  otherwise you might just feel like staying around the house all the time  which is the best in the end.
576002487041317086,Sandra June 2022 Very nice place  a little paradise in Corfù !
576002487041317086,Xenia June 2022 it's a paradise! if you are looking for peace and want to be away from tourism  the small house by the sea is perfect! the sea is right on your doorstep and crystal clear. achilles is super friendly and nice and provided us with fresh fish and vegetables every day. we would definitely come back!
576002487041317086,Owen June 2022 Possibly the best Airbnb we’ve ever found! An amazing property in a truly fantastic location. Axilleas is a great host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Highly recommended and will be staying again soon!
576002487041317086,Josina June 2022 Axilleas house is like paradise on earth! We were welcomed by him and his cousin who showed us all we needed to know about the house and the area around it which was so helpful. The house is  exactly like in the pictures  right on the beach and we spend most of our time on the beautiful terrace overlooking the sea. The sandy beach has very shallow water which is great for long peaceful walks and catching mussels (which Axilleas was so nice to show me how to). We have enjoyed the beautiful sunsets  falling asleep with the waves in the background and the privacy that this airbnb provides. Axilleas is such a wonderful host and always surprised us with local specialties like local fruits or fresh fish that he caught. Lefkimmi is a beautiful sleepy town and there is tons of small beaches you can visit in the area. Having some way of transportation  a car or bike  would be best to explore the area.  We would recommend Axilleas Airbnb to anyone who is looking for a peaceful getaway! We'll come back next year!
576002487041317086,Maria November 2022 Dear Acxilleas  We enjoyed the time at your place very much. The house is so cute  the view amazing and the sweet animals that come to visit every morning made us wake up.   Thank you for your warmth  fruits  delicious olive oil and homemade wine.

576002487041317086,Rémi November 2022 Axilleas is a welcoming  simple and respectful person.  We were amazed by the place which is just a short walk from the sea. The property is well equipped and maintained.  If you're looking for peace  this is the place.  There are also some cats and a dog that may visit you 🙂 Translated from French  Show original
576002487041317086,Meike October 2022 We can only agree with the good reviews. We stayed at Axilleas' place for 4 days at the end of our Corfu holiday and it was the perfect ending. The small house is wonderfully simple  perfect for couples (as a large room) but really equipped with everything you need  now there is also a gas stove and a covered terrace  which is currently not yet visible in the photos. We ate there in the morning and evening and enjoyed the sea and sunsets. There are basic things for cooking: spices  pasta  oil  coffee  tea  honey  drinking water  fruit  own vegetables  wine and olive oil. Mosquito coils  sunscreen and shower gel and shampoo were also available. Axilleas is super nice and relaxed  he does his thing and is happy to help if necessary. He even gave us a squid from his catch. There is good company due to the friendly  trusty dog and the small and large cats  but they always stay outside. Two large supermarkets are 10 minutes away  otherwise Molos is very quiet in the off-session  which we enjoyed very much. Axillea's studio is really a wonderful place to switch off and relax  Axilleas is a great host  I hope we could come back sometime and that the place keeps its magic!

576002487041317086,Christiane September 2022 The studio is well equipped and the place just fantastic. Quiet  stunning scenery  the sound of the waves and changing colors offer such relaxing moments. Swimming is very pleasant. Thank you Axilleas. Translated from French  Show original

576002487041317086,Silvia September 2022 A little paradise - this proposal is our ideal beach vacation: quiet  directly on the beach  very nice and curated by the owner. Spacious and comfortable space  simple  but with all the necessary comfort  we were welcomed by Axilleas and his friends with simplicity and warmth; we appreciated their products   offered with spontaneity and courtesy: oil  wine and fish caught on sight  in addition to the charming place  which allowed us to spend 15 days of absolute peace and well-being  surrounded by the sea roll and the summer wind and to walk inside the wonderful forest of ancient olive trees and cypress trees  which surrounds the house inland. In the immediate vicinity is the excellent Petrakis Taverna  which in addition to the local food  also offers a beautiful equipped beach and several pleasant and quiet places: Lefkimmi  along the river  with a choice of typical restaurants and shops  and Kavos  on the west side  more touristy  in addition to the beautiful beach of Arkoudilas Highly recommended!

576002487041317086,Pierre July 2022 I was shared between the desire to keep this Paradise's address secret and share my enthusiasm to others  at the risk of not being able to return  as this rental is likely to be taken over quickly. To keep it brief  and to paraphrase some other reviews  we have the ultimate Airbnb! Quiet  secluded in a beautiful forest  but shops are still within walking distance  if you like to walk a little  and the sea view is idyllic. Axilleas  the owner  stays discreet during the few moments of daily presence  but full of small touches (thank you again for the tasting of sea knives from the last night!). A big thank you also for picking us up when we arrived and bringing us back to the village on the last day in her pickup! The fisherman's house is very well equipped  everything is there  even valuable masks for diving! We will surely come back very soon  if this Paradise is not taken over and therefore made inaccessible! It was a dream vacation for both of us! Thanks again to Axilleas!

576002487041317086,Malte June 2022 Axilleas' apartment is absolutely unique. It is a quiet place in the middle of a beautiful forest and right on a secluded beach with turquoise water. The sound of the waves accompanies you to sleep and wakes you up in the morning. If you open the door  you have to walk two steps and stand in the water. The apartment was excellently equipped and Axilleas has been an exceptional host who has accommodated an earlier check-in than usual  provided homemade wine and even offered a transfer to the next connected places. I've never experienced such hospitality before. I highly recommend staying at this place and would like to come back myself  best regards to Axilleas! Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Thorsten May 2022 This was the highlight of our Corfu trip for us! I would even say our Airbnb highlight so far. A unique place to stay with unique impressions that we will never forget. The sea noise  the clear water on the shallow beach  the sunset and and and...if you are looking for peace and seclusion  you will find your place here. Unique!!! That's all I want to give away at this point  everyone has to experience this for themselves:) In my opinion  you should have a car  quad or the like for self-sufficiency  as the supermarket is about 2.7 km away. It is about 2.0 km to the nearest tavern. We definitely want to go there again. Axilleas is a lovely and great host who gave us so much impressions  simply indescribable:) Great  great  great...!!! Translated from German  Show original
576002487041317086,Robert May 2022 We were warmly welcomed by the two brothers. The house is fantastically located directly on the beach and you can fall into the water from the bed:) and you are rocked into sleep from the sea. The old house has been completely newly renovated but kept its charm. We especially liked the open fireplace. We also liked the location  the garden and the secluded beach also very much. The swimming facilities are great it goes into the water very shallow and you can harvest mussels if you know how to do it. We enjoyed walks in the vicinity. We would like to book this accommodation again  on our next stay in Corfu. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Linda September 2022 We stayed at Kiriakos’s place at Glyfada. We loved the views. He left us coffee for the morning which was a nice touch. If his place would have been available we would have stayed longer! I highly recommend Kiriakos’s place for your stay on Corfu Island.
6224037,Innokentiy August 2022 Great communication  incredible view. Spectacular apartment . Highly recommended
6224037,Gordana August 2022 We had great stay at Kiriakos apartment. The balcony view was amazing. Kitchen was well equipped. Just few minutes walk from the lovely beach. Wi-Fi was working perfectly. Great hospitality from Kiriakos  he greated us with tasty home made red wine and few fresh home eggs for our liitle daughter :) Thank you!
6224037,Georgina July 2022 We had a lovely week staying here. The balcony view is priceless and it was so nice to be able to hear the sea. As others have mentioned  you can also hear the beach bar but it wasn’t loud and on the one evening it was louder the kids enjoyed dancing along. The apartment is really clean and well equipped and as a family of four it was fine with the one bedroom. It’s a short walk to the beach and with two young kids we spent most of the time at the right side of the beach as the water is super shallow  little or no waves and it’s only sand in and out the water. Perfect! We also found a nice taverna with a pool which the kids used almost everyday. The Green Bus runs in the summer and we took a lovely evening trip to Corfu Town for the price of 6 euros! Kiriakos was friendly and helpful including organizing our luggage storage when we had a long wait for our flights home.
6224037,Arbri July 2022 Amazing host. Answered any questions we had very quickly. The apartment is very clean and in a great location. It's a short walk from the beach with a great sea view!

6224037,Angelica May 2022 Very nice apartment in a great area  close to many beaches. Kiriakos and his dad have been kind and helpful with us. The flat has a super view  priceless! We had a great stay - I definitely suggest this place to everyone!
6224037,Sándor April 2022 The view is amazing  just like in the photos. The kitchen is well-equipped. Glyfada is a secret calm place and you can easily reach every part of the island by car in 30 minutes. Highly reccomended.
6224037,Maya April 2022 Incredible view! The apartment has everything you need for your stay. In the off season you have the beach just for yourself! The host gave us a tasty self made wine as a welcome gift
6224037,Olesya October 2021 Wonderful stay at the apartment! Kiriakos was welcoming and kindly explained how everything works. Very convenient if you have a car as there is a dedicated parking spot with gates. The apartment is quite (we stayed in the end of October) and you can hear the sea from the bedroom. Plus  great sunsets from the balcony. Would totally recommend!
6224037,Antonia September 2021 Very nice Appartement on the seaside. As the restaurants are all rated rather poorly  we decided to cook for ourselves which is a pleasure in this Appartement. Everything you need is there and the terrace gives a stunning view.
6224037,Selena September 2021 👍
6224037,Snjezana August 2021 Hristos (Kiriakos‘ dad) was really helpful. Picked me up  drove me back  left wine in the apartment and provided tips. You can hear the sea waves at night in the apartment when it‘s calm. So relaxing. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
6224037,Gregor August 2021 A very nice apartment with a great view! 3min walk down the hill to the beach. Great sand beach. Sun shades available at the balcony  which are totally necessary!  There’s is only one con: - the Beach Club pazuzu is playing music the whole day (august) which is a little bit annoying - there is no real supermarket- they are just small and super expensive  so you need to rent a car to get to a normal priced supermarket  Overall we recommend a stay at this apartment! It’s a lovely place to be!
6224037,Tine July 2021 Very happy with our stay in this little paradise. The beach is next to the apartment and very kids friendly. Most amazing view from the balcony and many things to do and explore in the area. We will defiantly come back!

6224037,Karel June 2021 Nice and simple apartment close to the beach. Perfect communication with host.
6224037,Angela May 2021 Great location on a long sandy beach  perfect views from the balcony. The appartement is located in a lovely resort  but there is no village closeby. The appartement is as shown on the pictures. We had a magnificent time in kiriakos appartement.
6224037,Thomas November 2020 Very nice place with everything you need in an amazing location right on the beach!
6224037,Matthew October 2020 A fantastic location 2 min walk from the beautiful beach. Great beach sea views from the balcony and responsive hosts will great local knowledge. They even saved us when our boat broke down and we were adrift and I couldn't get hold of anyone else!
6224037,Petr September 2020 It was excellent. Glyfada Beach is a beautiful place.
6224037,Laura September 2020 We had a wonderful time at Kiriakos‘ apartment! It was really pretty and equipped with everything you need. The host was so friendly and dedicated to help us with everything. We enjoyed our stay at Corfu so much!
6224037,András September 2020 We had a wonderful time at Glyfada. The view from the balcony was amazing. We absolutely liked the atmosphere. The apartment was well equipped  the host was very kind and he was really helpful.
6224037,Sophie August 2020 Thank you
6224037,Janeta August 2020 Very nice and clean apartment with a spectacular view over the sandy Glyfada beach. It`s located in Menigos resort - gated community with free parking. Kiriakos and his family were very nice  polite and easy to reach and communicate with. If you want to visit the villages near by  to shop or to explore the island a car is a must. The only minus is that there is no washing machine  which is a problem for longer stays. Thank you for everything!
6224037,Kyzzhibek August 2020 Nice and tidy apartment  ideal for 2-3 people  basic but decent equipment. The view from the balcony is spectacular! The host is very nice and helpful. The beach is 2-3 minutes walk.
6224037,Yalda February 2020 Kiriako's place was really nice. Just by the water  we ran on the beach in the mornings  and there was a nice private beach close by as well. The kitchen is equipped so we could cook. They have a private parking lot so it was very convenient to park our car. Overall everything was great.
6224037,Marianna July 2019 The host canceled this reservation 356 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6224037,Wojciech July 2019 Lovely place.worth recommendation.
6224037,Anita May 2019 It was the second time we chose this apartment. And we are still in love with it. :) the apartment is just perfect as it is. We had everything we needed  even more. The communication was always fast  easy and kind  the whole apartment was very clean and comfortable. We got a surprise gift for Easter :) and loved it :) in our last phone conversation I said thank you but I say it once more  thanks for everything  we had a perfect time♥️
6224037,Hubert April 2019 Location is an uniqueness of this place - beautiful sandy beach and stunning view of the half rocky  half green hills descending to the blue waters. We were able to taste extraordinary Greek nature but the sea in particular being not disturbed by the crowds as it was still out of the season. The apartment is what you ask for the money  basic but cosy  rather recommend for a couple than full family. I'd definitely recommend it and consider to come back some time in the future.
6224037,Tony March 2019 Our stay in Glyfada at Kiriakos’ place was unique in ways more than one; mainly because of the time of the year that we chose to be (early March). We had Glyfada beach to ourselves  or at least as much as our eyes could see. It’s just a 2min walk down the pathway/stairs to the beach from the apartment. View from the balcony is amazing. House was clean and well equipped. Can’t comment on how it is during the summers  but we definitely enjoyed the solitude this time of year. So if you’re coming during the low season  remember to get all the ‘supermarket stuff’ on your way there. Kiriakos’ father was kind enough to give us a ride to our next stop- Acharavi (for quite a reasonable charge).
6224037,Veselina January 2019 The balcony view is unafirgettable! The most pleasant place where I can hear only the sea waves and see endless sea horizons! Our host Kiriakos was very kind and was always ready to help us. Glyfada is very beautiful and green village and our apartment was just perfect for my family to have a wonderful holiday. It is sutuated in just a few steps away from the beach!
6224037,Christopher October 2018 We had a perfect time in Kiriakos Appartement!
6224037,Nasirai September 2018 Apartmentequipt as descriped. Beautiful balkony. Nice view. No mounting for the showerhead. Check in welcome was not the best.
6224037,Desislava September 2018 The view is just the best! Having your breakfast at this balcony with the awakening sun on Glyfada beach makes your stay unforgettable! Very nice and sweet place! It is very well equipped - the host has thought for everything  even coffee and anti mosquito device. The host waited us close to Corfu town and has guide us to the place even though we arrived a little bit late. Thank you very much! Perfect place for vacation!
6224037,Peter August 2018 Very nice place. Same as described. Flat is situated in Menigos Resort. Nice view on the beach. Quiet place. We enjoyed sunrise and sunset from the balcony. Near are small shops with everything you need but for higher prices. Beach is sandy and clean  without algaes  you can go in to the sea 50 meters and water is still not very deep. Kiriakos answers fast and was prepared to help all the time. I recommend this Kiriakos`s place.
6224037,Anastasia August 2018 The flat has a very nice view and it is 2-3 minutes far from the beach. It is fully equipped for a family with a baby ( a baby bed and chair was provided).
6224037,Carol June 2018 Great place in the Menigos resort. Though it is high up in the hills  the views are fantastic. The place was very clean and had a wonderful balcony. Nice bedroom and bathroom. Enjoy Glyfada in this beautiful apartment.
6224037,Milda May 2018 The apartment was lovely with better views out of the balcony than the pictures. We enjoyed our stay in the apartment and the beach was fantastic. We came during low season in Mid-May when there were not too many people so it was very peaceful. The water is crystal clear and the apartment is well decorated. We were greeted with fresh flowers and homemade wine. I hope to return here soon!
6224037,Marek May 2018 The place is really nice. The apartment is situated in the small village. It’s really close to the beach (5min walk) which is very beautiful. Some say it’s one of the best at Corfu. The only disadvantage is that it’s hard to get anywhere without a car. The closest village it’s about 2h walk. But if you just want to enjoy the beach or you rented a car I think it’s perfect place. We’ll definitely come back.
6224037,Marloes April 2018 Beautiful location and a clean house. Also the hospitality of the host was amazing! We were out of season  so in Glyfada were a lot of things closed. But with a car you can see everything and it is nowhere too busy!
6224037,Anita April 2018 The house was awesome with beautiful view  we had everything we needed. The beach is also beautiful and it's really close to the apartment. Kiriakos and his father were both really kind and helpful. :) It was not my first time on the island but it was the best accommodation where I've spent my time. :) I can just highly recommend for a perfect stay :) (for shopping and traveling around the island - especially before and after the summer season - a car needed but to have a relaxing week on the sandy beach  perfect without it :))
6224037,Tamas April 2018 Perfect location with fantastic view from the terrace to the see!! Communication was very easy. We got everything we needed for our stay including coffee  sugar  salt  juice  and also a bottle of good wine!! Thank you! We had a very nice stay in the apartment!
6224037,Sanne October 2017 Lovely apartment  in good condition  beautiful sea view and really quiet. Nice place to stay with two kids. The only problem we experienced in october  was dat the holiday season was over  so all the supermarkets  beach bar/ restaurants in Glyfada were closed.
6224037,Melanie September 2017 We spent a realy good time in Kiriakos' flat. The vew from the balcony is just wonderfull ! The appartment is clean and well equiped. You can access to everything on walk (supermarket  restaurant  beach). We met his father  he is realy great person ! ;-) We hightly recommand this flat.
6224037,Dafinka August 2017 Wide sandy beach and crystal clear water of the Ionian Sea plus the great hospitality of Kiriakos and his father makes Glyfada beach magical place for your summer holidays.The apartment is just a few minutes walk to the beach  very clean  equipped with everything you need to feel like home. The view is breathtaking!
6224037,Elize July 2017 Great stay! Amazing location  close to the beach  market  restaurants. We went with our 10 month old and it was very easy and manageable. Would definitely stay here again.
6224037,Jana June 2017 We enjoyed our time in Kyriakos's apartment. He and his father are very friendly and helpful. The apartment is very nice (like on the pictures) and close to a beautiful sandy beach. The view from the terrace was stunning too! We will recommend to anyone travelling to Corfu.
6224037,Dobril June 2017 Great place to stay may be even with two kids. Close enough to the wonderful beach. The host has made all the effort to provide a comfortable and unique accommodation. Personal touch in every detail helps. Gated community - safe and pleasantly quiet. Beautiful see view. We would gladly stay there again.
6224037,Kevin May 2017 Lovely location right on the sandy beach. (Many beaches in Corfu are stoney) Location is quiet area  away from tourist center (good for us) Rental car is needed.  Apartment is clean and comfortable  in good location with private parking. South facing balcony with great views of the beach and coastal scenery. Comfortable bed with airco. Furniture is basic but totally functional. Good value for the price (we paid around 50 euro a night)  Wifi was good enough  worked most of the time  a few blackouts for a few hours. Fast enough to stream Spotify but not Netflix in our experience.  Only suggestion is to improve some of the kitchen equipment. The pans are hardly usable  and lacking knives and chopping boards. (We had to buy our own knife which we left in the apartment) Also a basic stock of some kitchen fundamentals is expected: salt/pepper  oil  sugar etc.   Show more
6224037,Laurent & Kathleen April 2017 Fantastic place with a wonderful view ! Kiriakos was very flexible about our arrival et departure time.
6224037,Ali April 2017 A very pleasant stay. Great beachside location. Excellent communication with Kiriakos throughout.
6224037,Emily April 2017 We had a great time staying in Kiriakos' apartment it was very clean and the view from the apartment was beautiful. Great location  beautiful beach and very easy to explore other beaches and the town from Glyfalda. Thank you so much:)
6224037,Hugh October 2016 A lovely place. Very peaceful just out of season.
6224037,Aliyah October 2016 We had a lovely time in Glyfada  we only stayed for two nights as it was part of a longer trip in Corfu and Albania  but would definitely like to come back and stay for longer. There were four of us staying in the apartment and there was plenty of space to accommodate us all. It was lovely inside with a great balcony and only a few steps to the beach. The beach was beautiful and there were plenty of bars and restaurants. If you are self catering it pays to be organised and stock up on food before you arrive in Glyfada as there aren't many food shopping options in the resort. Kirakos and his dad were incredibly helpful  providing us with all the information that we needed and arranging transport for us back to Corfu town on our last day. We ended up going for a big walk to Pelekas and had some delicious food on the beach and drinks in a taverna at the top of the hill in the town. Would highly recommend this trip and apartment!
6224037,Aleksandra September 2016 Everything was wonderful. The apartment is just like in the fotos. The hosts were very helpful  beach is right under  and it is great!
6224037,Christina September 2016 We have just returned from a lovely stay in this apartment. The views are wonderful  it was peaceful and very clean. The kitchen was very functional  the bed was large and comfortable and the apartment included all of the basic amenities you would expect. Kiriakos has been delightful to speak with and his father met us from our taxi to show us around the apartment and give us useful guidance on the local area which we really appreciated.  For those who have not been to Glyfada before  beware there are only 4 places you can eat in the resort (all within 5 minutes walk)  two of which are not great. If you want a wider selection  be prepared to take a bus to Corfu town or a taxi elsewhere. There are two small mini-marts which sell essentials but other than that  it is just a lovely beach with very calm  shallow water.  Overall  a very comfortable and enjoyable stay and we would love to return again!
6224037,James August 2016 Great spot - clean had all we needed for a nice 2 night stay
6224037,Anna August 2016 The apartment was great  big enough  very clean and close to the beach. Kiriakos answered me quickly and his mother helped us a lot when we arrived there  I totally recommend it!
6224037,Daniele July 2016 Kyriakos and his father Christos are very reliable and nice persons. The description of the house is exact and accurate. The house is really as it looks in the photos. The beach and the sea are wonderful. However the resort and the surroundings are very poor in terms of shops and restaurants (low quality and very expensive!). Moreover the wi-fi connection is very bad and should be improved  but probably this depends on the overall resort's network.
6224037,Hollie July 2016 Loved our stay with Kiriakos. His father welcomed us and was very patient while we got lost and took a bit of time to find him. He showed us everything and had great instructions. We were very close to the water  which made it so easy to take our little girl. The AC worked amazing and we did not have to worry about the heat. One of the best things was the soundproofing which is so important if you have a little one. Apparently there was a large celebration (this only happens once a year we were told) on the beach  but we had no idea this was happening until we walked outside. We couldn't hear the music from the beach until you walked outside  but even then it was not at all bothersome. We would definitely stay here again. Very clean  great hosts  and family friendly!
6224037,Pamfili July 2016 Kiriakos and his father were perfect hosts. Very easy to reach and eager to make sure everything is going well for their guests. The flat has a beautiful view  was very cleaning and provided for everything you need  including Coffee and Juice and Kiriakos father's homemade wine (thank you again!). The resort was very quiet and the sea very beautiful  so perfect if you're looking for something quiet in corfu. There is a very beautiful Mountain village nearby that has a few restaurants and bars and even corfu town is only a 20 minutes drive away. I recommend warmly
6224037,Kerstin July 2016 We really appriciated the stay in this cute and nice flat. Especially the balkony with the sea view is just wonderful - we used to have breakfast and dinner there. Kiriakos as well as his father and mother were really helpful and kind with everything. We had a great time and missed nothing in this fully equipped place. The beach of the resort is really nice even if we recommend to rent a car and visit different beaches - there are a lot around. Furthermore  we suggest to buy the foodstuff in a supermarket outside which is a lot cheaper than in the resort. In summary it is a really nice place to stay and we felt really comfortable. Thanks a lot for the hospitality!
6224037,Deborah June 2016 Lovely little apartment  big enough for our purposes  very clean and tidy with everything we needed. Very nice balcony with sea views. Peaceful resort  just what we were looking for. It was wonderful to wake up and fall asleep to the sound of the sea. Shop a few minutes away. Sandy beach with umbrellas and sunbeds for 8 euros  also just a few minutes walk (down a very pretty little path full of flowers  with swifts flying overhead). Couple of tavernas right on the beach  a fabulous bar for evening cocktails and a super restaurant at one end of the beach. Just enough for a perfectly enjoyable and relaxing holiday. Kiriakos kindly helped with arranging airport transfers. Sheets and towels were changed and apartment cleaned during our stay. Problem with the drains on arrival but Kiriakos was very responsive and helpful and his father arrived with a plumber almost immediately. His father also brought us the most wonderful homemade wine and gave us a lift into Corfu Old Town one day. I would not hesitate to recommend both the apartment  our hosts and the resort and would happily return. Thank you very much!!
6224037,Richard May 2016 Fantastic appartment. Clean. Nice view from balcony. Close to the beach and restaurants  supermarket  greetings Richard and family
6224037,Callum May 2016 Kiriakos is very responsive and quick to offer assistance. He answered all our questions throughout our stay. The apartment is situated in a relatively remote holiday resort  which we weren't entirely expecting but otherwise enjoyed. The apartment was clean and very comfortable and overall we are delighted to recommend Kiriakos and this apartment.
6224037,Sarita May 2016 The house was better than in the pictures  the area was amazing relaxing and the views you need to be there just to imagine. The landlord was very nice! Hope to meet again!
6224037,Frank April 2016 Wonderful accomodation hosts father came late at night to greet me and was very friendly. Fantastic views spotlessly clean appartment. Beach looked clean and inviting.
6224037,Stefan September 2015 We enjoyed staying at Kiriakos place a lot. Glyfada was the perfect spot to explore this beautiful island or to relax at its wonderful beach. The apartment was as in the pictures and the environment quite and Kiriakos as host always reachable. Thank you and your family for these great holidays!
6224037,Saskia September 2015 It was absolutely a great place. In the apartment there was everything we needed. One of the things we loved was the sound of the sea. And ofcourse the view.
6224037,Elena September 2015 Nice and cosy apartment on a lovely beach! We really liked it and enjoyed our stay. Apartment is nice  just as you see it on the photos. Clean. Kitchen well equipped. Just few minutes walk from the lovely beach. Wi-Fi was working perfectly.  There is a bar on the beach and sometimes the music is loud but it doesn't happen all the time and never after 22h at night.  Lovely setting  nice villiges to go around  good location for exploring Corfu. I recommend it!  We would like to come back :-)
6224037,Tina August 2015 Kiriakos' apartment was perfect for our stay in Corfu. It was clean  well equipped and had an amazing view. The WiFi signal was strong and much appreciated. We loved that the kitchenette was so well equipped and that the apartment was furnished tastefully. We were lucky enough to find a bottle of homemade wine and fresh eggs in the refrigerator  both courtesy of Kiriakos' parents and their hens. Such lovely hosts  and the apartment was perfect. After visiting every coast in Corfu and many different beaches  we still felt that Glyfada beach was the best! The restaurant on the beach (near the rocks and private residence on the hill) was top notch and consistently good. I would highly recommend Kiriakos and his apartment.
6224037,Marija August 2015 The apartment looked exactly like in the photos. The location was perfect the beach with an amazingly blue sea and golden sand could be reached in 2 min by walking. The host was super friendly and helped us as much as he possibly could in all the situations. Everything was pretty much perfect and our holiday was unforgettable. The only minor disadvantage could be a really poor internet connection  but even that didn't ruin our stay because if needed you could always find proper internet connection down at the beach. Would recommend this place to everyone  especially if you're looking for a quiet getaway with a possibility to travel around Corfu as the apartment is located right in the middle of the island.
6224037,"Xabier August 2015 My wife and I originally intended to stay at Kiriakos' place during our 2 week honeymoon but we simply couldn't stay. The apartment was clean and as in the pictures. Kiriakos also kindly organized a Taxi to take us from the airport to Glyfada.  Upon arrival we were dropped off by the driver with a set of keys and nowhere was Kiriakos to explain anything about the apartment. Internet was not working and we couldn’t even find how to turn on the water heater to take shower. After sending a text message Kiriakos agreed to meet and explain a few things about the apartment.  One big problem is that internet doesn't work. In itself that's no problem  but here what is advertised as WIFI  and paid for  is not the apartment's WIFI but a resort wide internet which never worked.  Secondly  we have never encountered such a dishonest and misleading advertisement. Quoting directly the description:  ""between 14:00 to 17:00 you are in a lively atmosphere  after 18:00 you enjoy absolute tranquillity of the Mediterranean seaside.""  ""at post evening hrs you can only hear the sound of the waves.""  Well  every night you hear music until 9pm from the bar  so you can’t enjoy the ""absolute tranquility of the Mediterranean seaside"". Every Sunday there is a huge party which lasts longer and also on other nights (for us Monday  but after moving we saw that big parties were also held on Friday and Saturday too  it was advertised on posters all over town and on the bar's facebook page). Even if you close all the windows and doors you can still hear the music inside  therefore we couldn't even enjoy the terrace. If you enjoy listening to electronic music above the waves then it's ok  but when you look for a place defined for its absolute tranquility and hearing the seaside it is horrible.  The worse was Kiriakos  when we asked him about internet he said he would fix it with an alternative solution and then we didn’t read from him for 2 days. Considering the above points and not having any news we decided we had enough and would cancel our additional days to look for a different place to enjoy our honeymoon. Of course within minutes we are graced with news from Kiriakos who very passive aggressively demanded how we could dare cancel the days (flexible cancellation policy Kiriakos has chosen!). He blamed us for spending his money fixing WIFI and that it was ready to install if we could drop whatever we are doing to go meet him  even demanding us ""Where are you right now?"" and ""Where are you exactly?"" to talk. 2 days later internet was still not working (we see later guests still had the problem)  Overall the place is ok but we would urge Kiriakos to honestly describe the noise and WIFI so he can attract the right type of guests and also to learn how to treat people respectfully (being honest and reliable). Show more"
6224037,Dániel July 2015 Kiriakos and his whole family welcomed us replay warmly  his Dad even gave us some home made presents  such as melon  which was growing his own garden! The apartment is awesome  everything is as you can see on the pictures. Kitchen fully equipped  the whole apartment is extremely clean (they even cleaned the apartment during our longer stay)! Kiriakos even brought some fish for us  since we couldn't by fresh fish to cook ourselves nearby...! Thank you for that again! The beach is just perfect and it is about 2 minute walk from the apartment. The host even arranged us taxi from and to the airport! The whole island is precious and can be easily explored by renting a little car at the reception  where the apartment is located. If you are looking for a place in Corfu Island  Glyfada is the perfect beach and Kiriakos's apartment is just perfect. Greatly recommended!
6224037,Christian July 2015 My girlfriend and I stayed at Kiriakos's place for a week and we were made to feel very welcome. When we arrived we got a bit lost and Kiriakos made the effort of coming to meet us where we were and take us to the apartment. He even showed us round explaining how things worked.  The apartment itself is great and has everything you need for a short stay  but we were a little disappointed to find that it is actually on a resort as this wasn't mentioned in the listing. Menigos Resort is reasonably nice and has mainly families and couples  however  we would have preferred a more authentic Greek setting.  The best bit about the apartment has to be it's balcony that looks over Glyfada beach  this was one of the main selling points for us before we made our decision of where to stay. It is much bigger in real life compared to the pictures  however  it does look over a rather busy sun-bedded area which is not shown in the pictures. There is also music coming from the bar very close most evenings  but it is normally at a low volume other than on Sundays when they have a beach party.  The only other issue we had during our whole holiday was the fact that the resort wifi had extremely bad signal in the apartment. We would have to go out to the beach to get any wifi most days and this made it very hard to communicate with Kiriakos  receive and send some necessary work emails and also plan our day trips around the island.  Glyfada beach is in a beautiful location and is very sandy with crystal clear waters. When in Glyfada we spent most of our time towards the right hand side of the beach where it is a little calmer and has no music playing. The middle area is quite busy and definitely has a younger crowd. We were in Corfu to relax and so didn't go there much.  All in all we had a fantastic holiday and would definitely recommend Glyfada beach as a destination to visit  however  if we were to holiday in Corfu again we would probably not stay there as we prefer a more quiet  less touristy location.  Show more
6224037,Steven July 2015 Our stay in this flat in Glyfada was great. It's located right in the beach resort  a short walk to the beach. The view from the balcony is beautiful  looking right over the sea. The flat is perfect for a couple  or like us with a small child. The sandy beach has an ideal area at the end for small kids and families. There are a couple of good food options with one mini market with some fresh groceries. We'd definitely recommend the flat and the location. We look forward to our next trip to corfu!
6224037,Ash June 2015 Perfect location to enjoy Corfu! A stone throw away from the beach and close to Corfu town. The host was inviting and very helpful with recommendations!

6224037,Gabriele September 2022 A great holiday in Corfu on one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. The apartment is minutes from the beach with fantastic sea views. An ideal starting point for excursions. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Lukas September 2022 A lovely stay and great location on the beach! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Christos September 2022 Everything is fine. Good location on the beach. Kerkyra can be reached quickly. The streets of Corfu are just extremely poor. This has nothing to do with the listing. Very satisfied overall. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Isabelle August 2022 Very good stay in Kiriakos apartment. The sea view is breathtaking  the beach is beautiful  very lively during the day. Kiriakos is a thoughtful host. I would recommend this property. Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Tetyana August 2022 Host is very nice and friendly! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Florian June 2022 A really nice apartment with everything you need for small meals. Wonderful view from the balcony. Even in the high heat  you can tolerate it superbly there. An easy way to the beach is available  where back up is a bit more exhausting;-). The communication with Kiriakos was always given and quickly accessible for questions. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Paul October 2021 A beautiful small apartment with great views of the lake. The furnishings are a bit older but it is clean  cozy and finds everything you need. If you are looking for party or nightlife  you have to drive a little. There are a few bars and taverns  but unfortunately they were already closed at the end of September. However  if you just want to go on a beach vacation  it is ideal. In Pelekas there are a few very nice tavernas. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Andrea September 2021 Very nice place with a great view of the sea and easy access to the beach. Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Pascale September 2021 Very nice location  quiet. Charming apartment. We arrived late but welcomed without worries with 2 bottles of homemade wine and water in the fridge. On the other hand  the village is far from everything  it takes a car to visit the rest of the island. Convenience stores are very expensive but the owner is nothing. We recommend ! Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Julia September 2021 Beautiful apartment with fantastic views of the bay - the balcony is larger than expected and offers sun protection on all sides. The communication with Kiriako's father was very nice  we were even allowed to check out later and received a bottle of his wine as a gift! Great location for a beach vacation  but car is a must for further excursions and shopping (small mini markets on the beach offer everything but expensive) Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Nadine August 2021 It was very nice. However  we were a bit surprised by the other reviews  as the information about the surroundings is not quite right. You are quite cut off from the surrounding villages and you need a rental car if you want to get out of this bay. The bus only runs every hour and otherwise you can get anywhere by taxi  but is quite expensive. The supermarket is extremely expensive there and it is worthwhile to drive towards Corfu city to shop in a large supermarket. The 2 taverns that are there are also in the complex and are therefore expensive! So if you want to see something of the island...definitely organize a rental car. The beach  on the other hand  was one of the most beautiful we have visited. And the apartment was also okay. The bathroom does require renovation  but otherwise everything you need was there. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Majcol August 2021 it is a paradise both the sea view and the location of the house in the residence ..... kilometer beach with sand and the possibility of renting sun loungers or going to the free one you will not find large gatherings anyway. Highly recommended Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Paul June 2021 Very good stay in Corfu at Kiriakos apartment!  Check-in was smooth in the evening  around 11: 00 p.m. The apartment is good  but it can only accommodate up to 3 people. It is generally well-equipped  even if it was missing some items maybe (a large stove  garbage bags for example  deckchairs for the terrace). Nothing that has forced us to honestly.  Kiriakos' father came to change the towels for us in the middle of the stay  which is very nice.  The apartment was very clean. Air conditioning is a real plus.  Glyfada is a beautiful place. All of them were there in June  so there weren't many people. I imagine it must be a little less friendly in July/August. Proximity to the sea is a real plus (it takes 3 minutes to get to the beach). Fine sands on the beach and in the water.  The beachside beachside/restaurants are not amazing  but the views are nice.  For departure  Kiriakos and his family were very accommodating  so no problem with that.  I highly recommend this apartment and its owners ! Show more Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Ryan October 2020 We had a very great stay in Kiriakos's apartment. The contact and communication was very good and we could easily contact him with questions. The location is great  the beach great and the view from the balcony is simply beautiful. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Pascal August 2019 Cozy apartment with a great view of Glyfada Bay. Close to the beach and parking. Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Stine July 2019 Super lovely little apartment. Good location and beautiful area. We enjoyed the beach which is 5 min from the apartment. We stayed 2 adults and 2 kids (it went fine) You definitely need a car if you want to get around the area. The apartment was as pictured and we had a lovely stay. We highly recommend it. Translated from Danish  Show original
6224037,Marie-Chantal June 2019 The apartment is small but well appointed in the colors of Greece in blue and white. It's well located if you have a car. We highly recommend the Spiros 97 restaurant near Vatos. And the value for money is exceptional and the decor under a pergola of vines   very Mediterranean. For bathers   this apartment allows access to a pool and the sea... with stunning views. A good choice! Translated from French  Show original
6224037,"Hanna June 2019 I loved staying with Kiriakos. Everything is well-organized. If you don't want to rent a car or take a bus  you can get help with cheap transportation. And Kiriakos was lovely all around. We came with our baby and he arranged us a crib and high chair  and even beach toys. The apartment has a terrace with beautiful views of the sea  the beach  and the ""green"" rocks. We don't like it when it's loud  so we choose off-season trips. We were recently in October (warm water and 27-28 degrees  now we were on the turn of May and June - a little colder). Recommended! Translated from Polish  Show original"
6224037,Anja October 2018 Kiriakos' apartment is so pretty and well divided and is in reality as seen in the photos. Plus a fantastic view of the bay and  if you look a little side  also of the sunset (we were there at the end of September/ early October  in summer this is probably different). The furnishings are sufficient but above all very cute and tasteful. The apartment is located in a complex  but which is very nicely laid out and very green. The individual houses and apartments are arranged offset from each other so that you are not very close to the neighbors and it was also quite quiet and pleasant. However  if the whole bay is fully booked in the height of summer  it could be different  as there are several restaurants on the beach in front of the complex  some of which were already closed. There are convenient mini-markets in the bars  but of course they are a bit more expensive than in Kerkyra. There is a reception service that has always helped with advice and action. And there are buses to Kerkyra and back several times a day  travel time about 45 min. Price 2.40€ Overall a nice place in a beautiful bay with beautiful clear sea and we would come back and can recommend the apartment. Show more Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Sebastian September 2018 Perfect for a few days of relaxing on the beach! The apartment has everything you need  even a small parasol for the beach was included (and also necessary). Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Александр August 2018 Very kind and attentive host  excellent location of the house both in the complex of the apartment and on the island. This is probably the best beach on the island. A limited number of shops and restaurants around. Everything is fine inside and matches the photos  but for a vacation with children it is necessary to understand that there is no washing machine and microwave. Translated from Russian  Show original
6224037,Enrico June 2018 The apartment is located on one of the most beautiful sandy beaches on the island. Obviously you need a car to get around and even do some basic shopping. In my opinion  it is not suitable for a family larger than two people  although since there is a sofa bed  there may also be a child. But the size is very small. The residence is very nice and quiet (at least in June). Translated from Italian  Show original
6224037,Hanna October 2017 Kiriakosa's apartment was a lovely place to stay. The terrace gave us views of the beach and the sea. Going to the beach was convenient. The apartment was quiet (we were in the off-season) and the decor was nice  fresh for the eyes  and had lots of space for our things. Because it was the low season  the shops were closed and it was nice that there was a bus (the GreenBuses) from Glifada to the city of Corfu (almost 1 hour 2/3 buses a day  stop near the hotel). It's a really nice place to unwind during the off-season. It also has very good wifi. Translated from Polish  Show original
6224037,"Otto September 2017 Kiriakos' apartment was a real happiness for us and significantly participated in the success of our first project ""2 weeks beach holiday"". The apartment is located in a lovingly designed  quiet and very well maintained holiday home settlement with winding streets and paths. The photos describe the apartment perfectly  but they do not give away the indescribably beautiful view of the bay - especially in the evening sun. We never knew whether it was nicer on the beach or at the evening beer on the balcony.  The apartment is friendly and thoughtfully equipped. Unlike many apartments in the neighborhood  great awnings are installed on all sides of the balcony  so you can protect yourself from too much sunlight if needed. The kitchen is tricky  so it is not overcrowded and we were able to prepare everything the market in Corfu city so wonderfully. There is no microwave  but instead a super stove with ceramic hob and oven. The communication with Kiriakos  his dad and his mom was always very spontaneous and informative (personal/email/mobile).  We can't wait to spend a wonderful holiday in Kiriakos' apartment again! Show more Translated from German  Show original"
6224037,Eldar September 2017 After other hotels on Corfu island  this one seemed very even good. The apartment is located in the Menigos condominium  among many similar houses. The apartment is on some elevation and this is a plus because it was damp in the morning (August). It is not difficult to get up to the house  even with children  but it will take a few minutes. Without a doubt you might need a car. Parking is available (located downstairs) and it has a personal space. A convenience store with some groceries (not very large) is available on the territory of the condominium. As for the apartment itself. It's okay. Clean. Some tiles are broken  the tap in the kitchen is a little old  etc. Well  all the little things are of course shabby  but this does not distract at all from the fact that it is spacious  cool in the heat  light spaces in which only the sea surf can be heard. And the view of the sea and the horizon  which opens from the loggia  covers all shortcomings. There (on the loggia) you can have breakfast  lunch and dinner quite comfortably  because the apartments have everything for such comfort. Keep in mind  however  that in Corfu  you may find wasps in the dining spots. They are here. Flying to eat. You can easily lose their interest if you add incense to your lunch. Overall we enjoyed the place and would recommend it to my friends. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original

6224037,Martine July 2017 Charming apartment with lovely views. Kiriakos is attentive and available for its hosts. Glyfada offers a beach with turquoise waters. Very good stay! Translated from French  Show original
6224037,Tatiana June 2017 Stayed as a family with a child of 7 years in an apartment in Glyfada. All of the information posted on the site is consistent. The apartment is within walking distance from the beach  as well as the bus stop. The view from the balcony to the sea is magnificent! At night you can hear the surf  during the day you can watch the bat of swallows. Reconnecting with nature!))) Satellite TV shows the main channels in different languages  but they are not necessary when there is such a beauty around! Transparent sea  sandy beach  fish. The kitchen is well equipped  I used the oven actively - works great! The apartment is clean and bright  has everything you need  even an insect picker. The grounds are well landscaped  there are showers to rinse off from the sand after the sea. Kyriakos  thank you to you and your mom for a comfortable stay in the apartment! We would love to come back to Greece again. Translated from Russian  Show original
6224037,Mark August 2016 Kiriakos' apartment was great: clean  bright and equipped with all the necessary things. The communication with Kiriakos was flawless  he responded very quickly and was very helpful. He organized taxi for us and also came as soon as we called him once. His mother cleaned our apartment after five days and changed the bed linen and towels. When we arrived  wine and juice were available in the fridge. We were very happy to accept it. We would book the apartment again! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Laura June 2016 The apartment looked exactly like the pictures. Great view of the beach from the balcony. Beautifully furnished apartment with all comforts. This location is always recommended. Everything worked out great with Kiriakos and his father. We will be happy to come back. Translated from German  Show original
6224037,"Peggy November 2015 The accommodation is as shown in the photos: well arranged  beautiful view  and clean (towels and shower products provided  as well as dishwashing products). On the other hand  we stayed there the last week of October  the season was over and nothing was open: no convenience store or restaurant... The advantage  we had the beach for us! Nice hikes to do around too. For us who love tranquility  I don't know if it would have suited us in the middle of the season because there is no soundproofing. And located at the top of the residence  the return from the beach can be ""difficult"" with little ones. Translated from French  Show original"
6224037,Bea October 2015 I stayed at Kiriakos's apartment in Glyfada with my family (two kids aged 4 and 7 and my partner) for a week. The apartment is part of a settlement of similar apartments  is close to the sea and you have a great view. The apartment is extremely practically furnished and you really have everything you need. Kiriakos and his father welcomed us very warmly (with their own wine) and answered any question within the shortest possible time. Kiriakos also sent a taxi driver to the airport who took us to Glyfada and explained everything. We had a great week  especially eating in the restaurants and shops of the Glyfada Bay and bathing in the crystal clear sea. I highly recommend Glyfada especially in the fall and Kiriakos as a host is a good luck! Translated from German  Show original
6224037,Laurence September 2015 WE realy appreciate our stay in kiriakos' flat. The flat is like the pictures. The apartment is very well equipped  comfortable and quiet. It comes with everything. The wifi is strong. Comfortable bedding. The view is splendid and the hosting was very pleasant. The owner is very attentive. Translated from French  Show original
591663219903205010,Margaret November 2022 Quite a large resort  we were travelling out of season  so mainly closed  but think it’s good in main season. You should have quite good mobility.
591663219903205010,Josephine October 2022 The location is very good. You walk to the beach in 1 min  it’s only down a few stairs. The terrace is nice to sit at. Do keep in mind though  that if you’re allergic to cats  it might not be for you  since there are roaming cats sneaking onto the cushions. The apartment is rather small but enough. The kitchen is sparsely equipped but doable for some easy meals. If you’re traveling off season you will definitely need it though (same as a car!!!) since the restaurants and supermarket in the village are closed. The bathroom is very musty since the ventilation hood doesn’t work well  but if you air it out it’s ok. Both hosts are really nice and even provide you with many recommendations (: Overall a nice stay in corfu!
591663219903205010,Soléman July 2022 Great house  great host  great beach In one word : perfect
591663219903205010,Hugo July 2022 Maria and Stavros' apartment is like described. A little gem  a few steps from an amazing beach. It is a little bit old  but well keep. Maria and Stavros are very communicative and promptly to help us. We had a problem that was repaired in a few hours. A top notch reaction.
591663219903205010,Will June 2022 Amazing place right by the beach  everything you need for a lovely stay in Corfu :)
591663219903205010,Julia May 2022 We had a great time here. The apartment is exactly like in the pictures and really cozy with beautiful view. Maria and Stavros were wonderful. They picked us up from the main gate of the resorts and it was no problem  that our flight was delayed. It was always possible to contact Maria and she even gave us some really good recommendations for corfu. Glyfada beach is beautiful but you really need a car here. Only thing that was different than expected is  that the neighbor of the apartment is the owner of it. And they sometimes had to go through our garden to get to their apartment. So it wasnt as privat as expected  but for us it was no problem. Overall we can highly recommend to stay here!
591663219903205010,Anne-Sophie May 2022 We had a great time in Glifada. Maria met us at the main gate and showed us the house. The apartment itself was exactly as described and had a wonderful ocean view. We really enjoyed the garden and terrace. The kitchen was fully equipped (there were basic amenities like oil and spices) and we even had a second terrace next to the sleeping room. The ocean with a nice sand beach is maybe 15 meters from the apartment. We had a designated parking spot  so there was no need to worry about the car. A mini supermarket and restaurants are in walking distance. We really enjoyed the stay!
591663219903205010,Lyle May 2022 This is a nice  cozy apartment with a lovely garden and great view. Good decor and furnishings. Easy and short access to the beach. We loved sitting on the terrace enjoying the garden and sea veiw. The host was excellent and we would definitely return!
591663219903205010,Natasha May 2022 Glyfada beach is hand's down the best beach we visited in our lovely time in Corfu. Staying at Maria's was a treat  simple  tidy and lovely details in the place. She gave us a really friendly check-in and when our flight home was delayed was gracious to let us enjoy the beach a little longer. I would strongly recommend staying at Ionian Senses!
591663219903205010,Nicolas April 2022 Great location great hosts. I would 10/10 return and recommend
591663219903205010,Colleen April 2022 Great little apartment with all of the basics you will need. It’s located steps away from the beach and the apartment is positioned in a way that it has a great view but it’s also very private. It is located 30 minutes driving from the old town of Corfu but we loved the idea of having a relaxing peaceful place to go after the busyness of being a tourist. Maria is very responsive  fantastic!
591663219903205010,Firdaws April 2022 Maria was a great host. She made sure we had everything we needed. The place was beautiful and a few steps to the beach. Book this place if you want a relaxing time away! You won't be disappointed. We enjoyed the beach and the hikes. The location was beautiful.
591663219903205010,Ricarda October 2022 We stayed at Maria and Stavros Airbnb towards the end of the season (October) and had a great time! The apartment is perfectly located to explore the island with a rental car  because every corner is wonderful to reach as a day trip. The nearby village of Pelekas is also really nice and offers a few nice places to eat in the evening. The hospitality of Maria and Stavros was really great! Every question was answered promptly. We would definitely recommend staying here! Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Nora October 2022 The stay with Maria and Stavros was absolutely outstanding! The location  right on the sea  is simply fantastic - the apartment is exactly as described. Maria is a great host  communication was excellent in advance and also during the stay. Even with a small water damage in the bathroom  she was on site in less than 1 hour with a handyman. In addition  she has provided us with her best island recommendations  which I can also recommend ;). Ionian Senses is definitely worth the trip! Thank you :) Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Max September 2022 Maria and her husband are pleasant and responsive hosts.  For the property  the property is located a little further from the waterfront than the photos suggest.  Neighbors must walk through the garden to access their accommodation (specified in the listing now) but photos are not representative. This reduces the expected privacy of the property.  Half of the stay was a problem with the hot water  but the hosts were responsive to address it.  The place is amazing  actually one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. As mentioned in many reviews and in the listing  it is best to rent a car. Translated from French  Show original
591663219903205010,Isabelle September 2022 The stay definitely deserves a 10 out of 10:) Translated from German  Show original

It is only a few steps to the sandy beach and restaurants and mini-markets are also within walking distance. Maria was a very friendly contact and gave us helpful tips for excursions and restaurants. Thank you for everything. Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Horst June 2022 Super nice hosts who take care of you! There are only a few steps to the beach with the super nice clean crystal clear sea ideal for snorkeling! For the sunset you have to choose another point  there are many beautiful places nearby!! The accommodation is in a great location  provides shade . .. You should adjust to two things: you are in a complex with many houses  the neighbor is left and right and up right next to you . . It is quite quiet there. . Yes and from 23 degrees the cicadas go to the alarm clock  you get used to it ;-)) or try to distribute it. . And the story with the air conditioners . . There are always people who overdo it  we were three days passing through here at 35 degrees and turned them on for 20 minutes in the evening  thanks to the constant breeze it was for sleeping OK. Thank you Maria+ Stavros😎 Translated from German  Show original
591663219903205010,Franck June 2022 Very good rental  magnificent sea views with lots of greenery. We were 50m from the beach. Maria is a very friendly and responsive host. Everything was very well organized  beautiful decoration. Translated from French  Show original

38667437,Katharina October 2022 The appartment is really beautiful with an amazing view from the balcony. It was really tidy and clean and we could feel at home right away. We loved our stay there and Effie is an especially great host. She was super friendly and communicative and she even found a solution for us as we had problems renting a car. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that wants to visit corfu!
38667437,Lihi September 2022 We had an amazing stay at Effie's apartment in the lovely village of Pentati. 1. Apartment - spacious enough for 5 people and designed very nicely. A home away from home with a gorgeous view from the balcony. Kitchen is fully equipped and we cooked a lot. 2. Location - perfect for exploring the whole island and getting to the best beaches. 3. Effie - the best host ever! Caring  nice and answers immediately to any question or request. In summary: we highly recommend. 5 stars :)
38667437,Martynas (Marty) September 2022 amazing property with all the things you may need. the views are astonishing and the host is super responsive  friendly and just overall awesome. The location is a very charming village - however  if you're not used to driving in mountain roads  take it slow!
38667437,Anna August 2022 Perfect apartment in a perfect location. Effie was a fantastic host who did everything possible to make sure we had a great stay. Thank you!
38667437,Loredana August 2022 Effie was an awesome host and she helped us with everything we needed. She was very responsive and very kind the whole time. The view from Effie’s place is so pretty. There is also a bus station very close to Effie’s place but it is better and easier to rent a car. Effie helped us to rent a car and so we could visit a lot more from the beautiful Corfu island.
38667437,Brad July 2022 What an amazing view! This place is a vacation in itself just hanging out on the deck and walking down to the little village for an authentic Greek taverna experience. Host met me on-site and was extremely helpful  communicative and friendly.
38667437,Lynne July 2022 What a view! A beautiful apartment in a great location. Very homey. Effie is a wonderful host  so friendly and accommodating. She had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival. We had a small amount of difficulty locating the apartment but Effie walked down the road to meet us! There is a good parking spot  quiet location  unbeatable view  friendly neighbors  well appointed apartment with everything we needed. Thank you Effie  we hope to return in the future!
38667437,Bálint July 2022 excellent sea view and impressive location

38667437,Sammy July 2022 Such a stunning apartment in the mountains of Pentati! There was 2 local shops (5 min walk) which sold everything you need and 2 gorgeous roof top resultants/bar also within less than 5 minutes  would recommend renting a moped to go to other beaches as they are maybe an hour walk but we walked and was a lovely walk  but there is a beach vertically down from the apartment and it’s almost a private bay with crystal blue waters and stunning backdrop views!!! House was equipment with everything we needed including some lovely bits from Effie!!! The views from this place I cannot even describe it’s beautiful 10/10 recommended
38667437,Nitish June 2022 Effie's place in Pentati is amazing. We had a great stay there. Effie was at the apartment to help us check-in  and explained us everything (parking  supermarket etc.). I would highly recommend this place if you want to experience Corfu away from all the tourists.

38667437,Clinton June 2022 Effie has a beautiful home. She gave us the best recommendations in the area. We enjoyed every moment of our stay in Corfu. Do not hesitate to book this accommodation!
38667437,Stephanie June 2022 the place is so pretty  in such a nice location. Pentati is worth the detour and Effies house was a highlight. everything is as described and communication was excellent.
38667437,Malte May 2022 Great place in a lovely mountain village with an astonishing view at the sea. You'll find everything you need for a relaxing stay in the apartment. Two beautiful taverns with great food  nice roof gardens and very hospitable owners are just a couple of minutes of walking away. You'll also find a mini market in the town  which offers all necessary groceries as well as freshly baked bread. Due to its central location  the apartment is ideal for day trips to discover the island. Effie is a courteous host  has always a good hint for a day trip or a restaurant visit and responds immediately to all your messages.
38667437,Lionel May 2022 Good welcome  quietness and very nice view in this typical small village. Good for 4 people or a family. Response from Effie May 2022 thanks a lot for your truly rate
38667437,Ralph May 2022 We enjoyed our stay at Effie's place a lot. The apartment was very clean and has everything you need. The view from the balcony over the coast is amazing and Pentati is a wonderful little village. Away from the tourism it feels very authentic. And Effie was a wonderful host  whenever we had a question she was quick to answer.
38667437,Laura April 2022 The place is exactly as described  beautifully located in a small village 30 minutes from Corfù Town.  The house is comfortable with an astonishing view. It is clean and full of utilities.  A special mention goes to the host  Effie; she stands out for her warmth  kindness and prompt communication.
38667437,Mark April 2022 Outstanding welcome and hospitality from Effie - and members of her family. We were made to feel like one of the locals and received lots of top tips on things to do and see on the island.
38667437,Hugo October 2021 This house is perfect if you want to discover corfu  well placed in a beautiful village with an awesome vue on the see. Effie is always available if you need advice or help.
38667437,Janosch September 2021 We enjoyed our stay at Effie's place a lot. The apartment was very clean and has everything that you might need. Most amazing was the view from the balcony over the beautiful coast. Pentati is a wonderful little village. Away from the tourism it feels very authentic. Lastly Effie herself was a wonderful host. Whenever we had a question or needed something she was quick to help.
38667437,Bohdan September 2021 A great place for a quiet holiday. We visited the whole island being close to the North and South. A few minutes by car to the nearest beach where you can relax  rent a boat and enjoy a delicious lunch. Very nice and friendly Effie gave us delicious fruits from her garden and eggs from her own hens. The apartment has everything you need and you can only come with hand luggage. My wife and I recommend this place.
38667437,Kevin August 2021 Everything was great. View from a balcony was fabolous ! Clean apartment  heartily recommend !
38667437,Benjamine August 2021 Very confortable house with view**** Super taverna angela’s at 5’  as well as small supermarket Trip*****
38667437,Wolfgang August 2021 The charming apartment on the edge of a small village  with a unique view of a large bay of the sea  offered everything advertised in the description. The reception was personal and Effie has responded immediately to queries. One bedroom overlooks the bay and the living area is spacious  the second bedroom has a good double bed. Enough space for four people. Both bedrooms have aircondition what was indispensable in the hot nights in August.  The location is close to beautiful beaches and has two tavernas and a small grocery store. It is important to be mobile  either a car or a motorcycle  as the place cannot be reached by bus. Narrow romantic roads allow only smaller vehicles. The usual noises of a village are acceptable sometimes a bit too early.  We especially liked the personal contact with the grandmother  an active and sprightly woman who provided us several times with fruits. Maybe this is not the normal service but we enjoyed it.  Thanks Effie for your hospitality. Show more
38667437,Josephine July 2021 We had a beautiful stay at Effie‘s apartment in the small village with a beautiful view over the sea. Effie was a very kind and friendly host! The apartment is simple but has everything you need for a perfect stay! We also got some fruits and vegetables from the garden. We would love to come back!
38667437,Edgaras June 2021 We enjoied staying at Effie's! The view through the balcony is amazing (mountains and the sea). At this place you will find everything you need for a comfortable stay! Effie is a very kind and helpful host. We arrived late in the evening to the place but she took care of the coffee  water  fruits and traditionnal desserts for us for the next morning!We do recommand Effie's place!
38667437,Gerrit September 2020 The house with the apartment is beautifully situated in 200m height on the slope of the west coast. The view from the balcony is fantastic. Having breakfast here is great.  The people of the village are very hospitable. By car it takes 15 minutes to reach a wonderfully quiet beach in Paramonas. If you like more life  you should go to Agios Gordios.  The hostess was very friendly and answered every question with pleasure. Thank you very much.
38667437,Rutger August 2020 Effie’s house is very comfortable and has everything you need for a great time in Corfu. The view from the balcony is beautiful indeed. A bit off the main road on a olive tree covered hill in the best (Western) part of Corfu  the village of Pentati is quiet  friendly and has some nice restaurants with super friendly people and home cooked Greek food.  Effie is a fantastic host  very responsive  helpful and friendly. She really thought along with us on how to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Plus her grandmother gave us fresh figs from the garden below the house and is the sweetest!  Would simply recommend this to anyone.
38667437,Stevie August 2020 Effie’s apartment is a great place to spend your holiday with the most gorgeous views you could ask for. We took a nice short hike to Agios Gordios from the apartment - it’s wonderfully situated for this and the hike is a nice way to explore the coast. Effie was able to be flexible with our arrival and leaving and is a really lovely person :)
38667437,"Anna July 2020 Effie is a great host. She always had time to answer all of our questions. We visited the apartment during covid-19 pandemic - she had a mask on  kept her distance and even provided us with a disinfecting gel. The apartment is spacious and has a lovely view from the balkony. There is a secluded beach within the walking distance but I wouldn't recommend it to families with young children. There are 2 great tavernas in the village. Our children prefered ""Angela's taverna"" (the owners has dog  cats and turtles and the kids loved playing with them)."
38667437,Anna October 2022 Enjoy your stay. She was so helpful. We were greeted with a nice surprise in the form of wine and snacks. The house was spacious and comfortably arranged. The kitchen has all the necessary appliances. Beautiful view from your patio. This is a peaceful and welcoming neighborhood. Nearby three taverns with delicious food  each worth a recommendation. We drove to the beaches because we wanted to get to know them closer and further  but we were happy to come back to our house and village for a true relaxation. Translated from Polish  Show original
38667437,Johannes August 2022 Our hostess was very nice and supported us very much during our holiday in Greece after two of my daughters got sick. Nevertheless  this vacation remains a good memory for us. Family NussbaumerJohannes Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Ioan July 2022 Very welcoming house... dream location Translated from Romanian  Show original
38667437,Adam July 2022 The house is beautiful  with a unique view! It is equipped with everything. Many beaches accessible by car and nice opportunities to eat in taverns. Perfect for a nice holiday on Corfu!! Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Carolin June 2022 We enjoyed our holiday in Effie's Apartment  with fantastic sea views. The apartment is clean and well equipped. Two very good taverns are within walking distance. Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Michael April 2022 We had two relaxing weeks in Corfu and a nice time in Pentati. Effi is a good host and took care of us. We say THANK YOU  also to her grandmother. We only met friendly people in the village and felt very comfortable. The kids could deal with the cats  dogs and chickens. The mountain roads require brave drivers and passengers...  Greetings from the Hunold family Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Jean-Paul October 2021 Effie is an exceptional host  both very present (welcome in the middle of the night  always reachable) and who does everything possible to welcome you. It remains discreet  but can move around if there is a problem  and this happened to us with a big storm. She's very responsive. Thanks to her. Translated from French  Show original
38667437,Marat September 2021 Nice apartment located in a quiet place with a beautiful view of the sea. Translated from Russian  Show original
38667437,Kerstin August 2021 We spent 4 days in Effie's apartment and felt very comfortable. Some of the furnishings are outdated  but it was very clean and the location is perfect with this view. Sofia's tavern below the house is especially recommended. Effie is quick to respond to questions. Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Julia July 2021 A very well maintained holiday home with fantastic views!  Fully equipped with everything you need  comfortably furnished and also pleasantly cool without using the existing air conditioning.  The hostess makes a great effort to ensure the well-being of the guests and is helpful with every question.  The neighborhood is located in a small village in the hills  a mini market and two highly recommended taverns are around the corner.  A perfect place to escape the stressful everyday life and unwind. However  a car is recommended  as the paths in the area are usually very steep.  We are very happy to have found this place and would love to come back! Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Angela October 2020 We felt completely comfortable in Effi's house and in the village. Effi is literally a Superhost. We can only agree with all the very good reviews  which were left before us by Effi's guests: very clean  well-equipped house  great views  a perfect hostess (not to mention her warm grandmother!)  a still really authentic Greek village with recommended tavern and a very good location for excursions to all interesting parts of the island. Translated from German  Show original
38667437,Martina August 2020 We had a wonderful quiet time in a beautiful mountain village. The accommodation is equipped with everything you need  plus fantastic views from the balcony. Effie is very nice  accessible at any time and her grandmother spoiled us with fruit and vegetables from her garden. You can eat very well in the village. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Charlotte October 2022 This property is just as stunning as it looks in these pictures. The inside has been renovated and looks absolutely great. You really can’t beat reclining on those sun loungers in the morning and kayaking after breakfast. Spyridoula is an absolutely brilliant host who could not have done more for us during our time there. The property really felt like a home away from home and we are certainly very keen to come back! I really can’t recommend this place more!
10722043,Georgia October 2022 Not too many homes with the sea at your front door. This area was very quiet when we visited in Oct. The weather was beautiful. The home was a little difficult to find as the GPS brings you to several in a row and you need to look for signs to find the home once you are in the drive. The home was very clean with great space. The pictures offered do need updating as it has changed. Over all I am sure it was a great picture of life on Corfu and the laid back atmosphere with the beautiful sea surrounding you. Easy access to the ferry (make sure you pick the one that is closer to the home. We thought we had but found out the ferry we used brought us to the town of Corfu which was very nice to see. We also stopped in small town near the home to shop and eat. Great people and great time. Wish we could have stayed longer to see the island as it seems to have everything from beaches to shopping to great eating places.
10722043,Rosey October 2022 We loved our stay at the Summer House. It was a perfect week for us. The location was fantastic  the house has everything you need and the position of the house near the sea was magical. We will be back!
10722043,Caroline October 2022 We had a fabulous week at The Summer House. The accommodation is comfortable & the location is fantastic. Waking up to the sound of the waves with the sea just past the end of the garden was wonderful. We relaxed in the garden   swam in the sea lots & chilled. Food supermarkets locally were well stocked but you need a car to get there. Lefkimmi has some nice tavernas & it was v easy to get a boat trip to Paxos from there. The Petrakis Taverna just round the corner is great & super easy to walk  canoe or paddle to!
10722043,Philip September 2022 We spent an amazing 11 nights at Summer House. The location is very private  often swimming on our own in the warm sea. Beautiful sunsets and a tranquility that took us a million miles from city life  almost like a retreat. A friendly Taverna a few minutes along the beach gave us a pleasant alternative to sunset bbqs. Spyridoula is an amazing host  very helpful  responding immediately and great for advice. First class holiday  we left with heavy hearts.
10722043,Sarah September 2022 Great place to stay  has everything you will need. Local driver recommended to us was great.
10722043,Harry September 2022 We arrived and it was pure bliss from there. Beautiful setting  there’s only one close restaurant but if you like cooking at home and just enjoy sunsets then this is the perfect place for you
10722043,Fozia August 2022 Feel so relaxed after our stay at the beach house. It was such a special and magical place to stay. The sunsets are brilliant and the stars too. The walk to the taverna was fun and its a great spot to eat by the beach. Lefkimmi town was lovely- not touristy even in August. l loved this part of Corfu and really like the Riverside restaurant Agali and there was another lovely place opposite the bakery (which you should try- delicious cakes). It's a perfect place for kids- you can relax as the water was so calm and shallow but not too shallow that you can't go out for a lovely swim. Spyridoula was such a brilliant person- really response and great recommendations. Thanks Spryridoula for a wonderful stay!
10722043,Fang Fang August 2022 The photos are not updated  but we do enjoyed the house and the access to the sea:) very easy communication and flexible with arrival. I recommend.
10722043,Nicola August 2022 A wonderful week in this idyllic  beachside cottage. It's really well equipped  spotlessly clean and off the beaten tourist track. A taverna on the doorstep and endless swimming (shallow sea) a step from the end of the garden. Also loads to do nearby. Sunsets looking out over the sea are breathtaking. Highly recommend.
10722043,Elliot Jay August 2022 If you like having the sea at the back of your garden (and who doesn’t?)  then this is a little piece of paradise. The sea is very shallow for a very long way out and the tide barely changes  so it’s an ideal and safe place for kids to play — and no stresses for grown-ups who aren’t strong swimmers! We spent most evenings out on the sea in the provided kayaks  watching the sun set over the hills opposite. Bliss!  A lot of Corfu has been spoiled by tourism  but this is tucked away in a little corner of seclusion — although most things are a drive away. However  if you’d really rather not drive  you can always wade through the sea to the local taverna.  We had a wonderful holiday  Spyridoula was fantastic with her communication (including getting an air con fault fixed immediately) and we’d thoroughly recommend her place. Thank you for having us!
10722043,Alison August 2022 Absolutely amazing! The house has everything in it that you need and things you didn’t know you needed for your stay! The location was perfect  so quiet and peaceful for a relaxing break. Having the sea at the garden gate was perfect  the water was calm  warm and shallow so perfect for my daughter to spend hours swimming while I watched from the hammock. The kayaks were great fun- we paddled down to the restaurant for dinner (the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and a great menu) Spyridoula was easily contactable during our stay to give any assistance needed and she arranged a local driver to bring me to the house and to the airport at a cost less than a taxi would have cost.  Perfect holiday  I will definitely visit again.
10722043,Emily July 2022 A perfect cottage  with everything you could possibly need. Spyridoula could not have been more helpful with organising our transfers and making sure we had everything we needed. Would recommend!
10722043,Chih-Kao June 2022 We have a lovely 5 day stay here : The „walk-in“ beach  the well-cared Garten  the great sea view 100 Meter away from beach the Water level are not even deeper than 1 .2meter  very safe place to enjoy the sea. we had lot of fun with the kayak! Spyridoula is such friendly and helpful  always answered in few minutes and recommended us some restaurants which indeed very tasty and with faire price. We have already recommended this place to all our friends in Germany and hope to visit here again :)  Best regards from Berlin  HSU & Li
10722043,Andrea May 2022 Fantastic house in a perfect location and an amazing host!
10722043,Mikk May 2022 Wonderful little garden with gates to the sea! We stayed in the middle of May and and we spent most of our days swimming and playing in the water. We really enjoyed our meals at nearby Taverna Petrakis.
10722043,Susan May 2022 The most wonderful location! Perfect to rest and relax with excellent local taverna a very short walk away
10722043,Ebony May 2022 Such a beautiful piece of paradise. We stayed for a week with our 6 month baby  and the summer house was the perfect location to enjoy Corfu. The property is beautiful and well equipped  and the sound of the sea lapping the shore is so relaxing. Spyridoula provided us with some excellent recommendations which were extremely helpful  and we enjoyed some delicious meals at the local tavernas. We will definitely be back again to to enjoy this gorgeous property and location.
10722043,Emma Jane April 2022 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the summer house. It was perfect for our 3 year old. Everything we needed was at our fingertips. Having the beach and sea outside the garden gates was perfect. Lots of fun on the kayaks. We cannot wait to visit again!
10722043,Christine April 2022 Though we did not meet her  she was available within the minute and always very helpful
10722043,Sarah April 2022 We stayed at the beach house early April and it was so quiet and peaceful. Nothing within walking was open but we were really happy to shop in nearby supermarkets and eat at the house  or drive to nearby restaurants. There is nothing like the sea being right outside the garden gate - so relaxing. I ventured a couple of chilly swims - not for the faint-hearted at this time of year - but it was fun to paddle up and down in the kayaks. We genuinely did not want to leave and could happily have spent a month there.
10722043,Yefeng October 2021 I have been to many Air Bnbs. However  never one whose back garden literally is next to the sea.  Spyridoula's is simply incredibly. it really is as beautiful as the pictures.  highly recommended.
10722043,Keziah September 2021 Spyridoula is an excellent host! Very communicative  the Airbnb is clean  and view is gorgeous! Thank you so much for everything!!
10722043,Vera September 2021 Beautiful property in an amazing waterfront setting. We loved the garden area and morning coffee on the beach with our toes in the water! Gorgeous sunset views as well. Do be clear on directions as first-time arrival may not be obvious for some drivers.
10722043,Paola August 2021 Beautiful
10722043,"Ryan August 2021 If you want peace  quiet (minus aircraft noise from the airport)  and your own sandy beach. This house is best! I would highly suggest for a small family as the beds and size of the home would accommodate no more than 4 people. the beach was great  having to not deal with crowds while enjoying 200 meters out from coast of ""walkable"" water is always a plus when trying to be socially distant. Communication was fast and check in was easy. helpful tip: bring mosquito repellent"
10722043,Lihi August 2021 Our family of 6 had an amazing vacation. The garden is lovely and the beach is a dream. We truly recommend staying here.
10722043,Teodor July 2021 This is indeed a lovely place to stay  far away from any distraction  in a quiet and peaceful corner of the island. We loved the calm of the sea in the early hours of the morning. The garden is very pleasant at any time. The pictures of the property speak of its' charm  so  there is no need to recount it. Before arriving here  one may better think to choose well his/her company but to bring few personal items  as many won't be needed.
10722043,Kate June 2021 It’s quiet  as beautiful as it looks and just lovely. The taverna almost next door is great too- just a few yards down the beach or (as the kids liked to do) a few minutes kayaking! Everything is provided. Even books  towels and mosquito repellent! The kayaks were a great hit with all of us too. So easy to use in the shallow warm water. Thank you xxx
10722043,Anna May 2021 The house is a gem  located straight at the beach with a wonderful greed garden. The sea is not deep straight away so the water is very warm. Everything what you need to chill and enjoy is provided: hammock  hanging chair  sun beds  kayaks  barbecue.  Spyridoula is a wonderful host  very friendly and welcoming  if anything needs to be fixed then it is done straight away.  We enjoyed our stay very much!
10722043,Matthew May 2021 delightfully out of the way the house is an idek retreat to look for some peaceful relaxation.
10722043,Colin May 2021 Dream cottage in a quiet part of Corfu  as it should be.
10722043,Henning October 2020 The house is absolutely lovely  very nice garden and located directly at the waterfront with great views. We enjoyed kayaking a lot with the kayaks being part of the property. The welcome and check in was warm and excellent. Thanks Charilaos!
10722043,Adie October 2020 fabulous chill pad on the beach
10722043,Andy September 2020 Great chill place. You need a car to appreciate this corner of Corfu. Petrakis taverna just along the beach are very accommodating. Even cooked us a corfiot special which we hadn’t tried before.
10722043,Fiona August 2020 We think this is the most beautiful spot in Corfu! The garden is a haven (and listen out for the wild tortoise scuffling along in the drainage channel) - the perfect place to relax and read and enjoy the heavenly view. The children loved swimming in the shallow  safe waters  looking for seashells and trying out the kayaks. It's also a great location for exploring the south of Corfu. The premises were spotlessly clean  and Charilaos was a caring host who checked in to see that we were okay. Just remember the mosquito repellent!
10722043,Julia August 2020 Amazing location next to the sea with beautiful sunsets! (Yes it really is as gorgeous as the photos suggest!)  A lovely place to relax - the garden  warm sea on your doorstep and beautiful sunsets make Summer House on the Beach really special.  The local Taverna is a 5 minute walk along the beach - a wonderful place to have a relaxed meal (right on the beach!)  fresh fish and other local dishes.  The house itself was clean and functional. All communication was straightforward and easy.  I would recommend some mosquito repellent for evenings outside!!
10722043,Claire July 2020 Such a wonderful stylish and comfortable house and the location is sublime. The sea is literally at the bottom of the beautiful garden. Our children loved the garden and the sea on our doorstep. We highly recommend a stay at this lovely home.
10722043,Klara July 2020 The summerhouse was very nice and just perfect for us with two kids (2 and 6 years old). The beach is sandy  the water is very warm and the garden is a dream. The apartment has everything you need. Charilaos and his family are very good hosts. They are kind and helpful. Thanks for the welcome basket! Close to the house is one other house. Our neighbors were very kind and respectful.
10722043,Ronnie October 2019 As beautiful as the pictures suggest. A near perfect spot for us and three young children who happily spent hours pottering around the garden  beach and warm  shallow waters. Views of Albanian/Greek coast and mountains are very special and taverna just a few minutes along the beach was a real bonus.
10722043,Bas October 2019 I've never written a review before  and I don't want to make it a habit  but this place deserves an exception. As it is exceptional. What a marvelous stay! There will be numerous houses on beaches  but I figure that most of them have a concrete or stone garden  but not this house: it's green and lush  with plants en trees  even on the beach itself. Furthermore  it's very convenient for kids: there're plenty of toys  and the sea is never deeper that around 50cm. Very cosy  very friendly  and a sincere recommendation.
10722043,Gwen October 2019 This beautiful home on the beach is just the nicest place you can ever hope to stay. Haris' mum and dad arrange where to meet to lead you to the house. And they are the absolutely loveliest people anyone could hope to meet. Haris' mum (Panagiota) even took the care to help me finalise plans to hire a car before we even got to Corfu. You really are in safe hands! Absolutely everything you need is already in the house. Everything that is listed is there and more. The beach is sandy  the water is warm  the barbecue has it all. Inside the bed's are comfy  the kitchen is really well equipped. The wifi is great and on a stormy night you can watch netflix on the big tv! If you want to travel round the island  Panagiota will tell you where the best spots to go are. It is a family home in the most idyllic spot you can find. But above all  it's invested with a soul that makes you feel very much at home too. We can't recommend this beautiful home highly enough and will be coming back next year!
10722043,Ashleigh September 2019 In a word: outstanding. Everything was simply perfect and exactly what we expected from the airbnb listing! The house has all the amenities you could need (including beach towels!). The beach is easily accessible and the water was lovely. We ate in the taverna (Petrakis Taverna) a number of times and the food was delicious and the best thing is it's just a short walk along the beach to get there. Panagiota was a wonderful host - very helpful and quick to respond to messages. I would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful place. Many thanks Panagiota and Haris!
10722043,Mark August 2019 A truly lovely little spot. The kids were in the sea from morning to night and we could watch them from the garden. The house has everything you need and Haris is at hand for help and advice.
10722043,Elena August 2019 Haris and Panagiota are the hosts of outstanding hospitaly  warm and caring  very responsive. Their summer house on the beach is highly recommended as a private paradise escape  where one can forget about the noise and stress back home. Just have your bathing suit on and charge your battaries with sun and sea power :-))) We hope to be back soon  Haris  thank you so much for a lovely week at your house this year. Our kind regards  Elena with family
10722043,Janet August 2019 If you value peace  privacy and a fantastic location  you will enjoy this house. We arrived in the early hours of the morning  even later than expected due to a delayed flight  but Haris was waiting for us. There was a bit of a mix up before we set off  as I thought he might be able to pick us up at the airport  but we were able to book a taxi instead. Be aware that if you arrive after 11pm  you will not usually be able to pick a hire car up at the airport. I was glad about that  however  as the hour-long drive is a bit hair-raising and I would not have wanted to attempt it in the dark. The best value taxi was Travelco of Corfu  which is pre-bookable online. It was expensive  but worth it. Summer House is exactly as you see it online  only I thought it felt a bit smaller - plenty of room for us though! If I had one criticism  it is that the kitchen area needs updated - counter space is very limited and everything is crushed into one corner. There is  however  a great big fridge-freezer. There was a lovely welcome package of food and the air conditioning was on  which was much appreciated  since it was a very warm night. The house was very clean and included everything you could think of  from games and toys  to rain ponchos and maps. Best of all  30ft down the garden and a step beyond the back fence was the beach  with the water going 300ft out at waist level. There is an airbnb next door of similar size  but apart from that and the odd passerby  you have the beach and a wonderful view of the bay to yourself. You can walk through the water  shoes in hand  up to the nearby Petrakis Taverna  which is what we did several times for lunch or dinner (Christos and his uncle Spiros  are lovely  helpful hosts). A car is a necessity  since the village of Lefkimmis is 2km away and the nearest supermarket is 3km away. We hired our car from Christos Fonteinos of Drivibe  Lefkimmi. I asked for the petrol tank to come full  but it came less than a quarter full. Apart from that  though  the rate was good and the car was fine for our needs. You need to take care driving through narrow village streets and pot-holed roads in Corfu  so I would advise taking out additional insurance coverage for any excess before you go. Once you go through the village  you reach the main road connecting Kavos to Corfu town. There is a JetOil petrol station down and across the road to the left  or a Shell petrol station a bit up the road on your right. We shopped at Dimitra's supermarket  where the staff were very helpful and which offers everything you could possibly need - it is just across the road to the right  on the bend. Lefkimmi has several good restaurants which are reasonably priced. It is worth searching out for the ones which offer traditional Corfiot dishes like Sofrito  Stifado  Pastisado  Pasticcio etc. While our house was virtually bug-proof  you need plenty of mosquito spray with you as I got quite a few bites sitting outside. We did not drive much  but we visited nearby beaches Boukka and Marathias  Petriti for dinner at a waterside taverna  and a drive through Kavos (yikes!). Since our flight did not depart until midnight on the last day  Christos at Petrakis Taverna was able to arrange a room for us for showering and an afternoon nap. His uncle  Eugene  drove us back to the airport for half what it cost us coming in! We had a lovely  quiet relaxing time at Summer House  away from the bustling tourist crowds. It was a little bit of heaven and I would certainly return and recommend to anyone. Show more
10722043,Emily June 2019 Certainly recommend! Pick up a rental car and stay here  you won’t regret it  Taverna within walking distance on the beach  and everything else a short but beautiful drive away.
10722043,Adie June 2019 Paradise in a little corner of heaven
10722043,Katriina June 2019 The house is everything the add promises or maybe even better. The house was clean and cosy  the garden is green and pleasant and the beach is shallow  water is clear and warm and the house is located in a very peaceful  quiet and private spot. The house really is at the beach - the waterline nearly touches the garden gate. Our holiday there was very relaxing. Evenings were very nice sitting at the porch watching the sea and listening the waves. The beach is ideal and very safe for small children - we were accompanied by a three-year-old who spent her days swimming and as the water is so shallow and the waves weren't big it was very easy for us to guard her. The hosts were very helpful and answered quickly to our questions. We would love to come back some day and warmly recommend this place.
10722043,Mattea June 2019 The private beach just outside the tiny green garden is a rest for the soul and a true gem for any sea/beach lover. It is a highlight of this property and a true private oasis.
10722043,Mieke May 2019 We had a very nice stay at the Sunny house at the beach. The weather was not always good. But we drive a lot in our rental car. From south to north. From east to west. A lovely island. Panagiota is very friendly kind and caring!
10722043,Gary April 2019 This is an ideal beach location. The house is the cleanest we’ve been in over many years of using air bnb. Hospitality by the host was excellent. It was a wonderful place to stay.
10722043,Radim September 2018 Great appartment filled with anything you may need including washing machine and two bahtrooms. Quiet place with sea on your frontyard (!). Great for kids as the bay is shallow with warm water. Panagiota quickly helped us with any of our needs.
10722043,Anja September 2018 It was a pleasant stay....and we wish to come back soon.
10722043,Monika August 2018 Panagiota's place is exactly as on the photos and a little better on top of that. It is in a very quiet part of the island. One taverna walking distance and 2 big supermarket within 10 min. drive. We even got some fresh fish from the nearby dock in the morning when the fishermen came back from the sea and made use of the outside grill in the garden. There were mosquitoes and quite a few wasps when we ate outside. But nothing that would spoil the relaxed feeling of the place  beautiful sunsets and amazingly warm and shallow water - perfect set up for the kids.
10722043,Anna August 2018 We spent two amazing weeks in this lovely house. Panagiota helped us so much with the instructions and we visited a lot of interesting activities. The location is perfect - it is very quiet here  very nice neighbours. You can easily get fresh fish or shrimps in the morning or afternoon. Lefkimmi is very peaceful village and Panagiota provided us with all necessary contacts.  We enjoyed our stay here very much.
10722043,Max August 2018 The house is everything described in the listing - quaint  private and well accoutered. Plenty of sheets  towels  soaps  etc. Directly on the water and a short walk from a nice taverna  the location is really fantastic. Would recommend a rental car to be able to get to the food market and other parts of the island during a visit. Panagiota is an excellent host who kindly left us fresh food to start our stay and provides recommendations for things to do. Highly recommend it - we spent about 10 days there with our two-year-old and had a fabulous time.
10722043,Elena July 2018 This is a great place to stay at for a family holiday. We love to travel and do it as frequently as we can  this is definitely one of the best places we got to stay at. You get nearly a private beach with shallow  clean and warm Ionic sea waters. Safe for the kids and good chance how to learn to swim. We enjoyed the paddle boat rides and had a fantastic relaxing time in the garden  where you have plenty of space to eat breakfast while watching the calm sea  read a book in the hammock  grill fresh fish from the harbor on the grill or just open the fence gate and enjoy the sea. A very nice Petrakis taverna is at a 2-minutes walk distance from the house along the beach. Try their greek salad  you will not be disapponted! They have free table tennis as well. You will find two grocery shops   which are Lidl and Dimitra market at a driving distance of around 5 minutes. More tavernas and places to get a lunch / dinner or just get a coffe and an ice-cream can be found in Lefkimmi  around 5 minutes by car. Panagiota and her son Haris are great hosts  they respond quickly to any needs and are very helpful. They welcomed us with fresh fruit  cold water  wine and a chocolate cake - the charming Greek hospitality. You will need a car to get around and experience the nature and small villages around. When you do that  please  rent a boat for a day! It was a magical day for us  when we anchored the boat and went swimming 2-3 km away from the shore in the same shallow magical waters of the Ionian sea! It was an unforgettable week  we do hope to come back and can recommend it as your next vacation place. Show more
10722043,Inken July 2018 A very special and beautiful place we can highly recommend.
10722043,Stuart May 2018 This is a great place to stay in the rustic south of Corfu. The location is awesome and we all (teenagers and parents) felt so privileged to be able to step from the house into the sea. There are barely any neighbours  so it’s really private. The outside hot shower was perfect. Shops are a short drive away  and Pelakis’ taverna on the beach just a short stroll through the surf is excellent. If you choose a time when the weather is baking hot (most of the time!)  you’ll love this place; there’s abundant open sky for sun worshipers and plenty of shade for those of us prone to overheating! The shallow sea is just divine  as is the house and it’s owner  who deserves a special mention for the special welcome we received.
10722043,Sarah April 2018 Panagiota is a wonderful host and available whenever needed! The house is very cosy and directly located at the beach so it is the perfect place to relax. But (due to the fact that the island is small) also central. The house comes with a lot of lovely details like flowers  games  and even binoculars to explore the neighborhood:) so you have everything you need. We had a great time and felt at home right away!! I would love to come back some time and would recommend the house to everyone who likes to take some time off and relax during their holidays. Thank your very much Panagiota:)
10722043,Tony April 2018 Wonderful private location. Accommodation very homely with everything you need - home from home. The whole family loved it here from our youngest children to our teenagers. We will definitely be back now we have discovered this little gem of a property. On arrival we were made to feel very welcome and was pleasantly surprised that everything we could of needed during our stay was available to us. Would not hesitate to recommend to others and have already done so.
10722043,Karina October 2017 Very cosy beachhouse in a very quiet area of Korfu. The beach is perfect for kids. The nearby restaurant is very good
10722043,Deborah October 2017 This was already our second stay at the summerhouse on the sandy beach and it was as wonderful as last year. The house is very cute and cosy and has everything you need. The location is perfect for being at the sea with children who cannot swim yet or for anyone who loves shallow warm water. We spent a very relaxing lazy two weeks there. This house is a hidden treasure! :-)
10722043,John August 2017 We had a great time here. The location is wonderful and perfect if you want a quiet beach holiday. Its ideal for young children as the sea is shallow and the kayaks were great for the older children too. The house is well equipped and the garden perfect for cooking and relaxing in. We really enjoyed being in south Corfu its much quieter and more traditional than the north and we particularly enjoyed our trips to nearby Lefkimmi.
10722043,Espen July 2017 The house is very nice  the area quiet  beach just 2 meters away  and all in all an amazing place. Two canoes comes with the house  and they were in constant use. Panagiota was easy to communicate with  and met us planned. We also really appreciated the fruit  vegetable  bread  wine and water she had left for us. Would recommend this house to anyone.
10722043,Alexandra June 2017 This place was incredible! Such a perfect quiet location - almost felt like our private beach. The house is very cute  and has everything you need  including board games! Panagiota and Harris were super helpful and very quick to respond. Really I can't wait to go back  and have already recommended to friends.
10722043,Efrosini June 2017 We had a magical time in Panagiotia's home by the sea. Such joy to wake up to a beautiful sea. The house was very comfortable for our family of 4. Panagiota's son met us at the house and gave us a thorough tour. He was very friendly and helpful. The kitchen was well resourced and thoughtfully stocked. Kids had lots of beach toys to play with. The beach was also secluded  which was a bonus and very calm  perfect for the kids. We also had a lovely dinner at the tavern 80m away. Thank you Panagiotia.
10722043,Katja June 2017 The house of Panagiota is fantastic and can not be described with words.We were there with our sons 18 16 and 12 years. And we had a very nice holiday.The sea was very warm. We loved the barbecue with sea view and sunset. It is a quiet location. The house is well equipped. Panagiota and their family are very nice and always approachable.The island has very nice places and all were very nice. The try the different taverns with the local cost is recommended. Panagiota- Thank you for everything. We will be back definitely.
10722043,Jaime May 2017 We had a wonderful time at Panagiota's place. The house is in a beautiful setting  is well equipped  the food and drink we were provided with on arrival was wonderful and Panagiota and her son were such attentive  generous  kind  helpful people - their hospitality was amazing.  We travelled with our 19 month old baby who had a ball - she loved the house  the garden  beach... I wouldn't hesitate recommending this place to families or couples. The house isn't situated in a touristy part of the island but it was even better for that I think!  A special mention must go to Vaso and her fantastic family run taverna about 50m along the beach. Such a friendly  welcoming place  in a great location. Do try the Gofos fish and prawn saganaki when you visit!
10722043,Peter May 2017 Lovely accomodation  great hosts  a place called Paradise! Don't bring lots of stuff as everything is there. Rent a car for your own convenience as the place is somewhat out of town.
10722043,Deborah October 2016 We spent 2 fantastic weeks at the summerhouse on the sandy beach! The sea is very shallow  and therefore the water stays very warm -> perfect for children. We  a family of four with children aged 4 & 6  stayed there the first half of October  and this was our best holiday at the sea ever. You are not near the beach  you are AT the beach! So whenever you feel like  you just jump out of the garden door  into the water. Paddeling along with the boats was also great fun. The garden is great for relaxing  reading  BBQing  and the children loved climbing in and out of the hammocks and up and down the tyre on the rope. The house is equipped with everything you need and furnished with great love and care. Panagiota and her husband gave us a very warm welcome at the house  including fresh vegetables  olive oil and homemade marmelade and wine! They explained us everything about the house  Lefkimmi and the region. Panagiota let us know when the flamingoes arrived at the saltpans  so we could go for a walk there and spotted them. The petrakis family restraurant is highly recommendable if you don't feel like cooking yourself  very children friendly. (Everyone LOVES childeren there!) I had the best Tsatsiki ever!!! We definitely would love to come back again! Response from Spyridoula October 2016 Dear Deborah  It was a pleasure to meet you. Welcome you back anytime! All the best to you.
10722043,Yana September 2016 Panagiota is a very friendly and welcoming host  she greeted us with all the information we needed about the locality. She'd also left some bread  home made wine and preserves for us  as well as some lovely olive oil. The house is very cosy  it has everything you might need on a Corfu holiday and more. The garden is amazing with lots of space for relaxation and a bbq which we took advantage of. Being right on the beach  the house is in a perfect location with a friendly taverna 3 mins walk away. The village of Lefkimi itself is a short drive away and has all you might need including supermarkets and places to eat.  Panagiota is very quick to react to any questions that might arise  I'd definitely recommend her place and go back there again.  Yana
10722043,Kerry September 2016 Panagiota made us feel very welcome and was a lovely friendly host. The house is everything it says on the tin and is in a very beautiful tranquil setting. A car is essential if you wish to explore the local beaches/area. You must also be prepared to carry luggage shopping etc 80metres along the beach from the car park.. This only added to the adventure for us. The outside hot shower was a real treat after a sunset swim  the wifi was good and the local taverna provided great morning coffee. All in all it was a very relaxing holiday on a beautiful beach away from the crowds and hustle and bustle of life. Many thanks to Panagiota for being such a gracious attentive host.
10722043,Alexandra August 2016 A great location for a beach vacation  whether for couples or families with children. God willing  we would love to come back to explore the beautiful island  because this time all I wanted to do was to stay in the garden  on the beach or in the sea. While it is true that one needs a car to do grocery shopping (the hosts gave us a ride to the local supermarket once)  it is quite possible to plan and shop for the entire stay. The kitchen is well equipped and there is ample space both in the fridge and freezer. We also walked to the village a couple of times. The Petrakis Taverna is very close  offering decent breakfast  lunch  dinner and drinks at reasonable prices. We particularly appreciated being picked up at the airport at 4.30 am. Arriving at 5.30  we were delighted to find fresh vegetables  bread  milk  coffee  wine and watermelon awaiting. The house is otherwise very well-eqiupped  including board games and art supplies  as well as the even more important first-aid kit! The bed linen and towels are of superior quality. It is also possible to get help from a cleaning lady  and she does a great job  too. The internet connection worked fine even for streaming videos (one device was perfectly fine  while streaming to two devices could get a bit tricky)  but uploading large files did not go as smoothly. I did  however  succeed in uploading large photos on Dropbox eventually  but these huge work files might have to wait. In other words - a totally adequate internet connection. The hosts are well-organized and efficient. We didn't experience any emergencies  yet  on one occasion  Panagiota and her family acted immediately when we needed. Show more
10722043,Peter July 2016 The perfect relaxing beach getaway. As a pairing of two couples  the beach house offered a wonderful opportunity to get away from it all. Panagiota was able to answer every question we had before we flew out and was there at the airport to guide us to the beach house  having recommended the best car rental for the week.  Idyllically situated right on the shoreline  we had to walk through the surf to get to the door  a lovely way to start the holiday  in addition to fresh watermelon  bread and tomatoes to greet us. We had the entire beach between ourselves and the residents of the neighbouring beach house for the week  and the calm waters were perfect for swimming  snorkeling and kayaking. Furthermore the garden offers the perfect mix of shady spaces and sunny spots  with hammocks  deck chairs and loungers as well as the beach itself. Furthermore the set up of the beach house was perfect for two couples  with two spacious bedroom areas and two separate bathrooms  plus the communal kitchen / dining space. While we spent most of our time outdoors  this made for a cosy indoor space for the end of the evening  before passing out in the comfortable double beds.  The local shops were a short 5 minute drive  from which we were able to source all of our bbqing needs  having made the most of the garden grill on a number of occasions. Further afield in the car we enjoyed dinner in Lefkimmi and took a boat trip to Paxos and Antipaxos from the port. We also made use of Panagoita's local guides to visit the beach at Gardenos  and would recommend everyone to go for at least one drink in the secret paradise bar along the beach; a bit of a walk  but the breathtaking view  brilliant barman and isolated beach loungers make it more than worthwhile.  Overall the holiday was absolutely brilliant. Panagoita was an excellent host and was there to answer all our queries beforehand and during our stay. The beach house itself is fantastic  it isn't every day you get to wake up to a deserted beach all to yourself  having fallen asleep to the sound of the sea Ideally situated to get away from it all  but still be within a short drive for shops  places to eat and drink  and other places to explore. However  I imagine just like us you'll simply spend it enjoying your own private beach for the duration of your stay  simply unbeatable. Show more
10722043,Le June 2016 We had such a lovely time at the summer house. Thank you so much  dear Panagiota and your family  for your hospitality. See you and all the best!

That cute little house in the Greek style💙  with a green garden💙  right on the seafront💙  in a small town away from the tourist hustle and bustle of the rest of the island💙  embraces you with calmness  its coziness and the gorgeous blue views of the sea and the oranges of sunsets. On the beach in front of the house no one came foreigners. The very hot water and it's not deep at all in a very long distance. It is a place where you rest on the truth. Host Spiridoula very nice. He met us warmly and intervened/promptly responded every time. Thank you so much! 💙 Translated from Romanian  Show original

10722043,Sabine October 2020 A true paradise to relax! The quiet  direct beach location  the beautiful  very well-equipped and clean house and the small garden with the hanging chair I particularly loved leave nothing to be desired. Panagiota and Haris are extremely attentive and friendly hosts. I was very warmly welcomed  provided with many helpful tips for exploring the area and as a welcome there was a basket with delicious  regional products. Efcharistó polý. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Matthias August 2020 Charilaos is a great host  the place is really uniquely beautiful for a relaxing beach holiday right by the sea in a shallowly sloping bay. We relaxed very well and enjoyed bathing in the warm water as well as the great sunsets. Thank you!! Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Chantal September 2019 I spent nine nights in this wonderful place. If you are looking for peace and quiet  this is the place to be. The sea right in front of you  what's more beautiful... If you don't feel like cooking  you can take your feet in the water to the Taverna Petrakis  the food there is great! I hope to come back soon.... Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Dorien August 2019 The house is nice  but not very large. Everything you need is here. The strength is especially in the fantastic garden and the location by the sea. I found Lefkimmi and its surroundings little interesting  but we had enough of a stay around the house  it was extremely relaxed  a bit atmosphere like in the tropics. Translated from Dutch  Show original
10722043,Doris July 2019 The Summerhouse is great in its naturalness  its proximity to nature and its comfort. A wonderful place for people who love a little individuality and are happy not to have too much tourism stress. Haris is a loving and understated host. Always there when you need it. We will be back. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Isabel May 2019 The house is really great! The beautiful garden is right on a small stretch of beach. The amenities were more extensive than we expected! Great place to relax! Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Undine October 2018 We had a great time in Corfu. The house was clean and cozy  the location by the sea was just fantastic! It is a place to feel good and relax. Panagiota is a great host and explained everything to us perfectly and answered our questions directly by email. Translated from German  Show original
10722043,Natalia June 2018 We were very happy we chose this house! We had a wonderful and relaxing vacation there. The warm sea at the doorstep of the house is like in paradise! The house has absolutely everything for living. Panagiota is a wonderful host and nice person. Many thanks to her! Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Jacobien May 2018 This cottage is a little paradise. Right by the sea  a beautiful spacious garden with sun and shade and a veranda. From the house  it is a short walk along the water to Taverna Petrakis where you can enjoy your meals. You can buy fresh fish directly from the fishermen. Kerkyra is a short hour drive. Furthermore  there are beautiful beaches nearby (we found Gardenos a nice place) and also the coast between Petriti and Notos is very beautiful. Panagiota is very helpful and nice attentions upon arrival. Bottles of wine  strawberries  tomatoes  etc.  were displayed on the table. In short  a very nice place  located in a quiet part of Corfu. Translated from Dutch  Show original
10722043,Harold May 2018 Panagiota was waiting for us a few blocks away to guide us to the cottage accessible by a sandy road. Once there  we got homemade delicacies and told them about the area in good English. The cottage has one bedroom  separate area in the living room with 3 beds and two sofas on which you could sleep. The kitchen is well equipped. The two bathrooms were very convenient with our two daughters. The house is fine to keep at temperature with air conditioning. Outside there are many types of chairs and hammocks to enjoy the sun and the fantastic views. In the garden there is a good BBQ and the garden looks well-kept and cheerful with the flowers. Right behind the garden is a mini beach of a few meters. Perfect for lounging. The water hardly rises at high tide. There are two canoes with which everyone can get on the water. It is quite a bit of rowing or swimming to reach the deeper water. So ideal to play in the water. You can stand very far in the water while the water comes to your center. The area was a bit quiet in May. It is a small village with nice Greeks who open a restaurant if you want to eat there. It is an environment to relax and unwind. We ourselves hardly made it to the garden and the beach. The view is unforgettable; a paradise. Literally a few steps from a quiet beach is pure luxury. Definitely a place for us to come back.

10722043,Sarah April 2018 Nice house on the beach  fantastic with children. The house has everything you need (also lots of scoops and other beach gear). The house is otherwise quite basic  but fine!

10722043,Павел September 2017 Great place ! Small beach that was instantly warmed up in the sun . And - a step to the beach   wear floats and go ! Fantastic place. Flying in like a day for two weeks! For those who will relax there  I recommend visiting the town of Chlomos  the fish restaurant in Petrikis Limnopoula  Marathias beach  this is one of the things nearby . Be sure to go to the marina at 8.30 and buy some fish to grill it in the evening and open a bottle of white wine to the sound of the raining waves . There is a baby cot and high chair in the house. At the back of the house is a wardrobe full of children's toys . Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Bastien July 2017 We had a lovely holiday at this beautiful house by the sea. It is a cozy little house with a garden that directly overlooks the beach. It's a perfect spot for families. Kids can enjoy the garden and sea (little background for a long time). The place is very quiet and relaxing. Translated from French  Show original
10722043,Roberto June 2017 The stay was pleasant and without worries. Panagiota and her son are very caring and gave us great advice. The accommodation is spacious  well equipped  simply and tastefully furnished  equipped with a beautiful garden that overlooks the beach  with hammocks  deckchairs  shower  barbecue fireplace and every comfort. Everything is set up for families with children  but the house is also perfect for a couple on an evergreen honeymoon! Translated from Italian  Show original

10722043,Olesia August 2016 My family and I had an amazing vacation. It was an unforgettable vacation. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. It turned out to be exactly as it appears on the website. Panagiota  was very attentive. Always ready to help. Her home is so warm and cozy you don't want to leave. It has everything you need for two lovers and families with children. It's a place where everyone can find something to do. In the morning the sea  in the afternoon a hammock in the shade of cedar and olive trees. You can just lie down to read. The child never wanted to leave the sea. There are books  board games and everything you need for the sea (air mattress  bucket with sand and water supplies)  as well as for adults two small boats with paddle boats that anyone can control  never even a person doing it. It was lovely. And in the evening the sunsets are magical. There are shops nearby that have everything you need (fresh fruits  vegetables  meat  fish). My husband and I walked to the port in the morning and bought freshly caught fish from the fishermen. There is a large oven in the yard  where you can make barbecue. If you don't want to cook  there is a tavern Petrakis within walking distance  where you can taste fresh fish cooked by you. Again  thank you very much to Panagiota and her family for this wonderful vacation! I think I'll go next year with my family. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
10722043,Vincent June 2016 We had a fabulous week at panagiota's place! The accommodation was even better than we imagined  a real break  quiet facing the sea... We only had very little to visit the surroundings so much we were well at home. Panagiota welcomed us warmly with her husband  available when we needed her. I highly recommend this accommodation  for families (ideal with children) or friends. We keep a very nice memory of it. Translated from French  Show original
657108834476555452,Calum September 2022 Villa is spectacular  with amazing views of the beach. Lots of sunbeds and outdoor seating suitable for everyone  pool is large and villa is comfy and homely. would advise having a car as the area is incredibly hilly but you can make do without a car as we did. great facilities and incredibky helpful hosts.
657108834476555452,Kosta September 2022 Cannot find words to express my satisfaction - everything was perfect
657108834476555452,Roxana-Geta September 2022 Our stay at this wonderful house was exactly what we were looking for. The location of the villa is perfect if you want to visit the best of Corfu  most of the island’s highlights being a short drive away. The Agios Georgios beach is 5 minutes away and it provider everything you would need  from taverns with great food to supermarkets. The house was clean and it’s very spacious. All the rooms have air conditioning which was much needed. The kitchen is very well equipped and has everything you would ever need. That being said the highlight of Villa Delfini is the exterior. Multiple seating areas to relax  enjoy a drink and get lost in the beautiful scenery that the islands has to offer. We arrived quite late and we had a very nice surprise seeing the lit pool that looks even better in person than in the pictures.  Overall i highly recommend staying if you visit Corfu.

24556512,Sabine September 2022 one of the best hosts we ever had. Debbie is very cute  super helpful and soooo funny. Staying at her place is staying closer to the nature. We loved it and will always remember our time there. Thank you. And remember: We are doing nothing and haven't finished yet. Miau Sabine and Sven
24556512,Christoph September 2022 Very relaxing place  built with love! We had some great days  everything was working fine (kitchen  water  solar  toilet - very clean) Debbie was very friendly - lovingly! Strong recommendation for people who like glamping!
24556512,Amanda September 2022 Debbie is a wonderfull person with great tips on what to do on your stay. The place has some really nice views. the road there is a little difficult but totally worth it in my opinion.
24556512,Isa August 2022 It is a great experience if you want to get away from city life for a while. Debbie is super helpful and sweet! Location wise  it might be difficult to reach if you don’t have a car. Carefully read the instructions before heading there!
24556512,Chiara August 2022 Such a great experience. Debbie is truly kind and so helpful. Would definitely recommend!
24556512,Magdalena August 2022 The site is beautiful! in the middle of nature  with a lovely view. Is an affordable way to see Corfu. We had a bit of trouble finding the location  maps sent us to another road. Once we found the right road  we damaged the car  be careful! is a bad road. When we arrived  there was no sign nor anyone to ask if we were in the right place. Luckily another guest confirmed it was the glamping site. There is little parking on the glamping  I recomend you leave your car parked on the road. The entrance of the glamping is quite steep. Maybe best to go by motorbike  we rented a small car that suffered a lot on this road. There is only one bathroom  but we had no problem with this. At night there was no light in the bathroom or kitchen. We got woken up a few times; by other guests  by a cat. But over all was a nice experience! our only issue was the road  which we didn't expect to be so bad.
24556512,Régine July 2022 Debbie and Nicholas were so kind  giving good advices and very helpful. It was really pleasant to meet such great people! We loved everything about the Olive Oasis. Amazing view and everything perfectly functioned. Sleeping and being in nature was a gift! See you soon! ❤️❤️❤️
24556512,Libbi June 2022 At Debbies’s we felt we’d come home. A beautiful place with beautiful people!
24556512,Kathrin June 2022 Debbie and her family have created something really special with this place. I left recharged and at peace. The bed was very comfortable and the treehouse offers the most amazing view over to the Mediterranean Sea. What is even more special is Debbie who was incredible welcoming and caring. She really thought of everything and offers everything one can wish for. I highly recommend staying here!
24556512,Milena June 2022 A really lovely place and very unique! Debbie and her family are really nice (as well as their dog is) and give you great recommendations for the area. Of course you can not expect too much luxury - but I thinks that’s not what you are looking for when you book this place. Everything you need is there. A lot of little details make this place really familiar and cozy. I would recommend you to rent a car to explore the area and all the great beaches! Try out the bakery and the cocktailbar (Zanzibar) in Pelekas - both are great! And don’t forget moskitospray!!!
24556512,Nils September 2021 Debbie and Toni created a really wonderful space with nice views and lots of places to chill. Also they are really lovely and helpful hosts. It was a great experience to stay in there camp!
24556512,Sebastian September 2021 Oh my god! This was the best stay we had in years! Debbie is such a lovely host  you have to meet her  to understand  what I mean: She is so dedicated to this site  built it with mind  heart and hands and is very committed to environmental protection. And you can always have a chat with her. From the tent or the lookout tower you have the most georgeous view on the sea. The kitchen is perfectly equipped with dishes  gas fridge and solar panels and even made from pallets. For all you travellers  who love to be in touch in nature  but don't want to miss out on comfort: This is your eldorado!
24556512,Alexander August 2021 Thank you Debbie & Tony !!! It was a great impression and wonderful experience of living in such amazing place !
24556512,Niklazz August 2021 nothing better  than waking up with seaview  hearing the cicades and having breakfast in the lookout tower we really enjoyed our 9 days stay at this beautiful and well-located campsite with an amazing and incredibly gracious host
24556512,Anna August 2021 I would definitely recommend visiting this beautiful place Debbie and her husband created! They both are really welcoming and always helped out when having struggles or by giving advices where to go. They provide drinking water every day  shampoo and towels and lots of love for all their guests. We stayed for 10 days and had the best time! For everyone who loves nature  wants to get away from their phone (which can charge with solar batteries though) and just relax on Korfu  I would definitely recommend going there.
24556512,Sarah July 2021 We've spent a whole week at Debbies place and definitely would recommend it! Its so beautiful! You can enjoy nature (cicada and birds are your background-playlist)   have a wonderful view at the sea from the lookout tower / balcony. Bathroom and kitchen are well prepared - in the kitchen you find more than basics to cook (lunchboxes  a lot of spices  … ). Debbie and Tony are so kind  attentive and open-hearted. They will do everything to make sure you have a wonderful time.  We did half a week without car (you can explore different beaches and restaurants  a monastery  or for example just stay half a day in the camping site and relax in the shadow of olive trees). It's about 20 minutes to walk to the beach. Also with a car it's a perfect starting point for tours in the north and south.  So if you still uncertain: Go for it! :) Otherwise you will miss something really unique and beautiful.
24556512,Lea August 2022 Highly recommended! Debbie is an incredibly warm person. She has created a paradise with her family! From communication to accommodation  which is truly heavenly  everything worked out. We will definitely be back! Thank you! Translated from German  Show original
24556512,Caroline July 2022 We had an unforgettable time at the campsite. Debbie is the kindest host I've ever met! She brought us homemade baklava  banana bread and ice cream  provided us with many tips about the island and welcomed us with a delicious wine. It was just great! Translated from German  Show original
24556512,José Luis June 2022 My partner is in love with the campsites  and I've never been to one.  After the experience  I can assure you how much we have enjoyed even more than I have.  Debbie is a wonderful person and her son even more. From the first moment they have been very attentive sending us directions to the campsite. On the day of check-out Debbie surprised us with a Homemade cake to say goodbye  amazing!  Regarding the campsite  it has everything. The bathroom is in good condition  the tent is spacious and has a huge bed. And best of all  the campsite has a treehouse to make the experience even more impressive.  We highly recommend staying at this campsite and wish Debbie and her son the best.  Guti and Drew Show more Translated from Spanish  Show original

589603277750201893,Robin October 2022 My husband and I spent four nights in Nina's lovely studio unit in October and had a lovely time. We loved the privacy of the back unit  the beautiful view through the trees of the Ionian Sea and the stunning sunsets. Lots of comfy seating outside was nice  but we didn't have enough time to enjoy the awesome hammock.  Nina was an excellent host and was so helpful  very responsive and able to help with our requests. The studio was spacious with a comfortable bed and a very well equipped kitchen. Nina provided a thoughtful welcome gift  coffee pods for the coffee maker  several very useful items in the refrigerator  and a bottle of wine made by her father. We loved it! Nina also recommended a couple of great nearby beaches and two restaurants in Pentati - Angela's and The Strofi Taverna. Both were amazing.  My husband grew up in Greece  and the small remote villages on the west side of the island including Pentati and Agios Mattheos reminded him of the old Greece from his youth and young adulthood  and we spent of time exploring these and other small villages  as well as the beaches.  In short  Nina's Mantzaros House and her hospitality are top notch. We highly recommend the studio and will look for it when we return to Corfu! Show more
589603277750201893,Katrin October 2022 We had a very lovely stay in Ninas cute little house amongst gorgeous old olive trees. It was super clean and had everything you could wish for. Nina also was very concerned about our well being and checked in on us regularly via text. She even filled the fridge with some stuff for breakfast  since we arrived quite late on our first day. The garden and the view was beautiful and we had a very lovely stay  that even the mosquitos couldn´t disturb.
589603277750201893,Jason October 2022 It's a magical retreat  perched on a cliff where we could watch the sun set in the sea through the olive trees below. Nina and her family gave us the warmest of welcomes and were generous in every way. We would love to return.
589603277750201893,Carole October 2022 Nina made us more than welcome and went out of her way to make sure our stay was a moment to remember- she advised us on restaurants  beaches etc and was always available to offer advice. Cannot recommend her higher as everything was just perfect 👍
589603277750201893,Nicole October 2022 Absolutely exceptional! If every host could be like Nina  and every place as well equipped as hers  I’d live in airbnbs! I cannot wait to return. Nina (and her father) are amazing and made my time in Corfu better than I could have imagined. Someone else said that this is what they imagined when they decided to come to a Greek Island and it’s exactly right!
589603277750201893,Lydia September 2022 This little paradise gave us 2 wonderful weeks. In the middle of nature  very private and absolutely lovingly furnished  with really everything you could need. We can only confirm the positive reviews. Nina and her family are magical  friendly people who looked after us in a helpful and open manner. Nina picked us up from the airport and brought us there  so that we only had to rent a car for 10 days for 2 weeks. But you need a car if you don't go on a hiking holiday. As others have mentioned  ear plugs are recommended at night as the neighborhood roosters and dogs sometimes get really crazy. Now  back home  I even miss that😅 Dear Nina  you are the best hostess I've ever had and if I ever come back to Corfu  then to your house 🥰
589603277750201893,Lena September 2022 We spent a week at Nina’s place. The apartment is beautiful and has more than you could ever need  like the outdoor shower or the swing chair. It is very calm and there are barely no people around. Nina was the most precious host  she welcomed us and set up the fridge with some food for the first day. She was always there when we had a question and gave us information about the local food spots or beaches. We would definitely come back. Thank you  Nina!
589603277750201893,Airam August 2022 Staying at Nina’s place was a pleasure  not only is she the best and nicest host   her place is great. The view is marvelous and the house has everything you might need. Its close to beautiful beaches and to any Durrells fans  many locations of the tv show are close by  always fun to discover. Nina is probably the best host we have ever had at airbnb.
589603277750201893,Véronique August 2022 We absolutely loved our stay at Nina's lovely little house. It is amazingly well- equipped  Nina has thought about every single detail to provide her guests with what they might need during their holiday. The views are also even more beautiful than in the photos and the yard is a mere wonder.

589603277750201893,Jean-Maxime August 2022 The house was really looking like the pictures  and was the perfect place for a break of few days. Nina our host was always available to give us tips  much appreciated!
589603277750201893,Sean July 2022 Our stay at Nina’s place in Corfu was lovely. The house was beautiful and well kept and Nina was an extremely gracious and helpful host with lots of useful suggestions. I would highly recommend it.
589603277750201893,"Bettina July 2022 The cottage is really amazing... in-between olive-trees  lovely decorated  perfectly equipped. We arrived and were surprised to find a ""first day survival kit"" in the fridge (food and drinks) - wow! It is just wonderful to sit outside and enjoy the view and the peaceful atmosphere....  Nina  the host  welcomed us warmly and gave us plenty of tipps - thank you again for your outstanding hospitality! :-)  P.S. As already mentioned there are dogs / roosters in the neighborhood - if you are a sensitive sleeper take earplugs along :-)"
589603277750201893,Aigijs July 2022 we did like our stay at this nice and cosy little home.. wonderful sunset  sea breeze right into your window  lovely sounds of cicadas  shade of olive trees.. i believe this is authentic Greece   at least this is the way we felt during our stay in Pentati..
589603277750201893,Phillip June 2022 Nina was a super lovely host which made us feel right at home  she even put some food for breakfast in the fridge  since the next day was a sunday  and prepared a little welcome gift for us. The house is beautiful and so is the view from there. Perfect for a holiday getaway.
589603277750201893,René June 2022 Nina is a great host! We really enjoyed staying in Mantzaros little house. It was really clean and perfect for two persons. We would definitely recommend it! Thanks Nina :)
589603277750201893,Francesca May 2022 Beautiful outdoor space  all the amenities you could need. Its a peaceful  relaxing retreat in the mountains. I would recommend you having a car to get around  or be a strong walker.

589603277750201893,Franck October 2022 A place away from it all in a stunning little house amid olive trees and with sea views. If you want peace and quiet  this is the place to be  you will be allowed to enjoy stunning sunsets. The house is spacious for 2 and very well equipped with a very well-equipped exterior. Nina was really very nice with a very good welcome and some little gifts. She was a great source of advice for our stay. I would recommend this place for lovers of calm and nature.

589603277750201893,Vanessa July 2022 This place was all I needed. A beautiful little house  garden  hammock  sea view and above all a lot of nature. Large olive trees that provide shade and a large spectacle of animals and insects to watch when lying in the hammock. Curious about who will be visiting. Nina was very helpful and caring  I felt completely comfortable and safe. However  it is important to have a car to go shopping or to go to the beach. This is too far on foot  at least in the heat. Oh yes  the neighbors have dogs and a rooster. Of course  they bark and crow. It didn't bother me  but there are more sensitive souls. I highly recommend this house  the value for money is unbeatable. Translated from German  Show original
589603277750201893,Betty May 2022 Nina is an exceptional host and her studio is amazing: - very well located and easy to reach (40 minutes by scooter 90cc from the airport)   at the edge of the cliff with sea views through olive trees  secluded and quiet  shady garden and very well appointed. - the equipment provided exceeded our expectations  there is everything you need on site! - Nina is very available and generous. - I recommend the experience of a meal at Angela'sTavern in Pentati: Makis  the chef is exceptional.

We were greeted at 1am following the very late flight  and Nina was there for us  with everything you need for breakfast in the fridge! direct sea view from the bed through a large bay window  and through olive trees. Strategic location for sunsets. Nina was really adorable and attentive  absolutely impeccable welcome! The place is rather secluded and away from mass tourism  very authentic. A mini market nearby in the village of Pentati. You can come without so much as a second thought. Translated from French  Show original

It was really easy to communicate with Dafni and Sofia (her mother) really helpfull and reative. We did not know that Sofia was living near the house but it was not a probleme at all  we were free to live as we want to be and Sofia was very helpfull for all our questions and asking during the stay.  Thank you so much both of you ! Pauline"
21941910,Julia June 2022 We had an amazing stay at Da Sofia! Sofia was a lovely host and gave us great recommendations for tavernas and sights to see. Incredible views and a great space to share with a group. Thanks so much! Response from Dafni June 2022 Thank you Julia for your kind words. Hope you enjoyed your holidays to the fullest and made the best memories! See you again soon 😃
21941910,Georgia May 2022 We had a lovely stay at Da Sofia. Mrs Sofia was lovely and very helpful but it wasn’t clear in the description that she lived on the property (downstairs). The pool area was beautiful and as described but the kitchen was very under-equipped. There were great restaurants within walking distance but you’d need a car to get to good beaches. We had a fab stay and thank you for having us!
21941910,Franz September 2021 Perfect stay  thank you!
21941910,Björn September 2020 ....highly recommended!!  We had an exceptionally nice stay in the villa. The hospitality was incomparably good. (Sofia  thank you very much for your help and tips) We have rented some houses from AirBnb before (Spain  Italy  etc.) but this is where we liked it the most. You feel that it is important to the host that you have a great vacation and a great time. The house is clean  modern  spacious and well equipped. The environment is perfect for getting anywhere quickly.  There is absolutely nothing we can say negatively....  Thank you for the many beautiful moments in Corfu and that we were able to live in your beautiful villa. Response from Dafni September 2020 Thank you so much Bjoern for your kind words. We are very glad you enjoyed your vacation. Hope to see you again soon in our beautiful island!
21941910,Seleena August 2020 Amazing place - Dafni and Sofia worked well together to ensure our stay was perfect. Sofia gave us some incredible recommendations for restaurants. Thank you!
21941910,Magali October 2019 What a beautiful house! The view is spectacular and the terrace is lovely. Very clean all around. pillows and bedding could be a notch comfier and more towels could be provided at no additional cost. Would have been nice too to have basic cooking ingredients but we were welcomed with a bottle of wine which was a nice gesture. There were many mosquitos inside the house on the first night so make sure to keep doors closed at all times! Host was very helpful to all our questions and was always available to check on us as she lives downstairs.
21941910,"Oscar August 2019 First  thank you for having us and our 4 dogs. Our personal experience was not as expected  but we all are different  yours may be to your expectations. We stayed mid August  Daphne and her mother are animal lovers  just like us. However  the amount of bees in the pool area did not allow us to spend much time. We use at home a garlic product to repel  but that is to the discretion of owner. True that the place does not have ac  and that is what states  it was my mistake not to look that big detail. Also true that you may not need ac  weather-wise  but the amount of mosquitoes and bugs during our stay  and a couple of days really hot  will make you think twice. Again  to the discretion of owner is she adds ac in the rooms at least. Distances to beach and Corfu town is true in kilometers  but if you have never driven this roads  will take you twice the time. I would suggest owner to add a mirror exiting the property  so you can see the ""one road  two car"" if someone else is coming. First let me say that Sofia is a very personable person  and really trying to assist you The detail that was really inconvenience for us and host I assume  is that she lives in basement. We assumed that she was on premises (usually separate house)  normal like many rental properties  and you are never aware. Since we did not have washer as advertised or at least noted  we had to impose and be imposed  every time we needed laundry  since we had to use Sofia's. Like I said at beginning  some people will be fine with this  we like our privacy. Also  and with total understanding (she lived in the house)  she would knock on door at her leisure if she wanted to communicate  and would do her garden activities  and daily life  yes she would ask first  but then it was not our place for that rental period. If you are fine with all this  the place is great  I made the mistake of not asking the right questions before booking  and that is 100% my fault. Pelekas is a nice town  and good restaurants/cafes  enjoy it. Show more Response from Dafni September 2019 We are unfortunate that you had this experience....unlike all our other guests. nevertheless thank you for your feedback. it helps us to improve. a mirror is of paramount importance. i will contact the municipality to install one as the mirror is not part of the premises. as for bees and mosquitoes  it's summer in greece. your feedback will be taken into consideration. perhaps keeping the nets on the windows closed at all times would help as well. Sofia is at our guests' disposal at all times  in case she is needed. thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Don't hesitate to contact us for further communication should you wish to do so.  Best regards Show more"
21941910,Ruairi July 2019 Lovely villa in a beautiful location. We were well looked after by our hosts for our holiday
21941910,Taryn June 2019 This villa was even better than expected! The home is very large with a beautiful view! The pool was great. Sophia was very nice and met us in the village because we couldn’t find the house. Then she provided us with many ideas of things to do and places to eat. Her suggestions were all wonderful! We loved the visit and would come back again. We felt very spoiled!
21941910,Katie June 2019 We had a wonderful stay. The host lives on site and prepared us a delicious meal on our first night  and she also gave us lots of local recommendations which were all great. The villa is beautiful with stunning rooms and a gorgeous pool area. We’d love to come back  it’s a great base for exploring Corfu by car.
21941910,Susanne August 2022 We really enjoyed our stay in the house. The villa was very clean and furnished as described. The owner Sofia  who lives in the basement  was very attentive and caring during our stay. We did not find this disturbing  as she always asked in advance by phone if she should change towels  for example. It's on site  though  so you should know. This does not really bother the privacy of my experience. To the previous notes about wasps and mosquitoes  I can only say that everyone (!) Windows are equipped with high quality mosquito repellent. Very positive! In addition  mosquitoes and wasps were not more common than at our home in Germany. There is no air conditioning  it was not really necessary due to the exposed location on the mountain - although it was hot in August. Translated from German  Show original

For this price you get everything you need - the interior is really lovely and Anastasia has thought of everything! However  the location of the apartment is a lil bit complicated in case you have no car - then it’s not that easy to find a way in the city even if there’s a bus. But this one comes only every 2-3 and on weekends it’s a mess. Nevertheless we enjoyed the stay  thanks for everything :)

547458275363887851,Paula June 2022 Clean and renovated house. It is located in a quiet place +/- 20 minutes from Corfu. However  there are not many restaurants or attractions in this area. Response from Anastasia July 2022 Nearby   in 1-2 klms there's a thematic aquapark  a golf course and places for a naturalist to see. Not to mention the lack of traffic u usually find on the eastern part of corfu. As far as restaurants are concerned  there are quite a few very close by  u probably didn't notice. Show more

The drawback is weak wifi signal (which can't be substituted by data  as there is no signal in the ground floor). The data and sometimes wifi were working in the first floor. But in general  really nice experience! :) Response from Anastasia June 2022 I'm sorry to hear about the internet connection  but it's not up to me. Internet services can be slow at times.

The place is one of the locals  which adds to the giant charm. The smells of neighboring homes are picking up and getting hungry right away. The apartment is a 5-minute drive from the stop which will take you to Glifada or Kerkira. Also  there is a cheap tavern next to it  but the food is of poor quality.

604337875585247007,Henry September 2022 We were there for two nights. Our 1 and 7-month-old son loved it there. There is chicken and sheep near the house. The first evening when it was getting dark he wanted to see sheep up close and started to scream if he couldn't go there (sheep went to the barn or away from a house)  hope we did not make too much noise while staying there.  There were a baby chair and bath which is a nice thing to have. The host and their family are really kind  they let us take a bunch of grapes and gave a gift to our son.  I would say the location is quite good. Both Lidles were 16-17 minutes car drive away from home  and there is a mini market in Pelekas but more expensive than Lidle's.  House wad everything you need  There is a TV with many channels and you can cook yourself to save money.  Recommended places near stay: Bella Vista Sunset Restaurant (book tabel advance) Paralia Mirtiotissa beach is a nudist beach  but you don't have to take close off. The view is amazing and go early in the day because parking there was quite hard. Kaiser William II Observatory - you can see how small Cofu is :)  To the hosts - Thank you!  Henry with family.

604337875585247007,Sergey September 2022 Nice house that feels like home. Good and friendly neighbors. It was very quiet  the little kid calmly went out onto the playground and we didn’t really worry about him. We stayed for 10 days and it was a very pleasant time. Be sure to buy something from mosquitoes  there are a lot of them.
604337875585247007,Mári August 2022 Great host  beautiful apartment. We loved staying here!
604337875585247007,Lukáš August 2022 Alex and his family are really great people  very friendly and hospitable. He was adaptable to our check-in and check-out time  responsed very quickly. The village house is situated in a quiet place  there is also available space for parking. The house was clean enough  well-equipped  we didn't miss anything except of a microwave but it is not a big deal. I appreciate there was an aircon  smart tv  large rooms  washing machine and fridge. We didn't have any problem  I liked our vacation in Corfu as well as in this appartment. Thank you.
604337875585247007,Klára July 2022 Our stay was really great. Communication with host was without any problem. We were missing few stuff at the accomodation but the host immideately got it for us. I recommend it.

21807694,Gary July 2022 Villa senses was perfect for us - three air-conditioned floors encompassing amazing views of the sea and Corfu Town from the balcony of the master bedroom at the top; a great 3 bedroom space for the adult kids on the lower floor; and a communal lounge  dining area  and kitchen on the middle floor. Garden was lovely with spacious pool area and wonderful pool itself. Plenty of places to sit outside both in and out of the sun. We liked the 2k walk down to and then back from Gouvia in the evening (you could also get a taxi/drive) with lots of nice restaurants and bars and a fabulous harbour with more restaurants/bars a little further on. It was also handy that the big supermarket was on the way back  near to where you could also catch an air-conditioned bus into Corfu Town (roughly a bus every 20 minutes).

21807694,Tui September 2021 This is a great house  perfect for groups and the pool area is stunning. It's reasonably well equipped (few kitchen items missing as well as having to buy our own wood and coal for the BBQ and pizza oven) but otherwise we had everything we needed. The location was a little remote and we definitely needed a car to just go to the shops  otherwise we organised minibus transfers through a contact recommended to us which was quite easy. The villa is managed by a property management company who were a little slow with responses when we asked queries (sometimes took hours or up to a day) but the owner was very lovely dropping by to say hello and even leaving a homemade cake! Thanks very much for the stay Sofronios  we'd definitely come back! Response from Sofronios October 2021 Dear Tui.

21807694,Stephen August 2021 Don't look further  just book this beautifully  well kept villa. From initial enquiry  the very helpful  prompt and friendly responses from the owners agents were truly professional and hit the perfect note. Do use GPS coordinates via Google Maps to find the villa if arriving at night. On arrival you realise quickly that it is a stunning villa  very well kept and super clean with everything you could possibly need plus many extras. The owners clearly have thought of everything and care about their guests. The welcome parcel of goodies was very much appreciated along with a giant  home made cake that arrived during our stay  thank you. The pool was just perfect with it lovely seating areas  BBQ and shaded area and gorgeous views. Inside the aircon was effective and quiet  the beds very comfy  the kitchen very well equipped and the WiFi excellent. The whole villa inside and out is kept in perfect condition and very obviously cared for closely by the owners. We have stayed in my parts of Corfu in the past as we just love this Island and this location was excellent  being quick and easy to get into the stunning Corfu Town as well as over to the sandy beaches of the west coast and up to the lovely coves of the North East Coast. Food recommendations were very well received and we loved all of them we went to  thanks so much. The owners were so friendly and helpful and we knew nothing would be too much if we had asked. Highly recommend and hope to return. Show more Response from Sofronios September 2021 Dear Stephen.

21807694,Clara October 2019 Our holiday at Villa Senses was nothing short of idyllic. The property is stunning - I would say the interior is even nicer than the photos  and the outside definitely lived up to expectation. We spent our holiday lounging by the pool and hanging out in the amazing spaces both outside and inside the villa. The entire group (we were six but the property easily fits 8) felt so relaxed and at peace.  This was despite the fact that one of our party slipped down the stairs and had to go to hospital on the first night. From the first minute  Eos staff and the landlord went above and beyond. The landlord arrived 15 minutes after we called to help communicate with the ambulance staff  and the Eos team sent a representative to the hospital to check in on us. They also followed up with us twice in the following days on how we were doing. It was truly outstanding and beyond anything we could have expected.  The wonderful landlord and his wife also helped us immediately with any issues we had  and even baked me a cake for my birthday! This was in addition to a lovely welcome basket with local delicacies  Truly exceptional holiday. One piece of advice is to definitely rent a car: we dithered about it but truly it makes your life so much easier r.e. being able to get to Corfu Town  although there is a local supermarket which delivers.

21807694,Vicki May 2019 We had an amazing stay at villa Senses. It truly is an outstanding villa. The inside space is lovely and modern and spacious. The outside space is fabulous and the pool is wonderful. The pool is just the right size that the sun warms it up and is large enough for plenty of inflatables. The owner explained that the pool was installed last year and it looked like no expense had been spared. It was beautiful. Everywhere was spotless and the owner came half way through our stay to clean the pool. If you dont wabtvto sit in the beautiful sunshine there is plenty of shaded places to sit outside and the villa is nicely elevated to get a small breeze. The pizza oven and bbq are a bonus for alfresco dining. The view is beautiful and uninterrupted. We stayed for 5 nights and the villa was cleaned to an impeccable standard twice during our stay. Towels were provided to use by the pool  which was a bonus along with plenty if towels for inside. The Villa is gated  not overlooked  with plenty if inside snd outside space. There is a well equipped kitchen and dishwasher tablets  washing up liquid and t towels were provided. The owner kindly left us a welcome basket  which was a lovely surprise. He also came to visit us to check if we needed anything  to give us some local tourist info and brought a delicious cake. Thank you!

21807694,Luke June 2018 I’m honestly not sure where to begin. The whole experience of staying in this Villa was perfect. We were greeted by both the villa owner  his wife and our contact at Eos Travel (who rent out the villa through Airbnb for the owner) with a plentiful amount of fresh fruit  local produce  information and smiles. They were all on hand throughout the week for anything we needed  whether that was help with booking taxis or finding a hotel for us to leave our bags/ relax at on our final day (we had to leave the villa earlier in the day before a flight late at night). As for the house  it was better than we could have imagined  the pool and accompanying sofa area were incredible. Perfect for relaxing and enjoying the sun. Inside the villa  the rooms were spacious  facilities were amazing and the finish to the property is of a higher standard than I’ve ever experienced in a European villa. We didn’t choose the villa based on the interior decor but it enhanced the trip more than we realised. The villa was cleaned twice professionally during the week stay (by an incredibly conscientious cleaner) to a very high standard which is again something I’ve never experienced in a European villa but puts this property in a class above the rest. Having your bed freshly made with clean linen and the communal areas cleaned and bins emptied (as well as cleaning the pool area) certainly enhances the trip. Finally  the owner was the highlight of the trip. He was the kindest  loveliest man we met on the island and his generosity made us feel so welcome. The little gestures like showing up with an Ice Cream cake when he came to clean the pool for a second time (as we were his first Airbnb customers!) just helped solidify our love for this wonderful man! This villa is suitable for a group of friends (as we were)  or families with children  as there were things such as wooden stair gates and a gentle decline into the pool  as well as lots of family friendly activities in the surrounding beaches and towns. It had good access to the North East part of the island which is considered the most beautiful  as well as just along the main road from Corfu Town. Would 100% recommend this villa to anyone looking to visit Corfu! Show more Response from Sofronios July 2018 Dear Luke   Good evening from Eos.

21807694,Aitor May 2018 Really nice house. It has a beautiful barbacue and an elegant swimming pool which is cleaned twice or three times during the week. The house is big and beautiful. Perfect place for a group of 8 people.
21807694,Martin May 2018 The accomodation was way more than what we actually expected - especially because of all the nice people that took care of us the whole time. They were there when needed: it was like staying in a hotel as for the services  but felt like home as for the attitude and willingness. We also got a lot of great advice about what to do in Corfu. Thanks all members of the stuff for everything! Also the quality of accomodation was very very high. Love at first sight - very close to the airport (cca 15 minutes ride) and oh  the view is trully gorgeous! It is up on the hill  so the whole neigbourhood appears clearly. It has a pool long enough to take a solid swim. 🙂 Besides all of the advantages mentioned above  the best thing - for us as a group that included small children - is that the house is completely children friendly - and children-proof:-) so that we didn't have to worry that anything bad would happen. There are lockable fences everywhere - the stairs  around the pool... Almost all of the rooms have their own 'private place' - a terrace or a balcony just for the two that stay in there  but there are also four larger places where you can easily chill out together (including f. e. grilling area) - which is more than enough considering that the capacity is 8/9 people (although I think it would be comfortable for at least four more). In short: the complimentary description of the Villa Senses suits it perfectly and we'll be really pleased to come back next time.

21807694,Jeremie July 2021 Very nice pleasant villa where we stayed for 4 adults and 4 small children. Communication was great. Cleanliness also with a cleaning once a week with the owner's cake as a bonus  where we spent the day outdoors. Only small downside  the kitchen is not very well equipped with cooking utensils if you like to cook on site. On the other hand  great barbecue also cleaned mid-week  very clean swimming pool and suitable for children because there is little background. The view is lovely too. Absolutely recommended.

43597921,Colin September 2022 The apartment had everything we needed…. The view and the peace were amazing…there is a small shop and we visited two restaurants  including the family one  both were good. You definitely need a hire car to get there and the steep walk up the hill past the church leads to another super viewpoint.
43597921,Andreea September 2022 This accommodation is even more beautiful than in the pictures. The entrance is not from the main street  but from a small alley. The view of the sea and Corfu is just magnificent. We loved everything here (except the road from Agios Gordios): the village  the sunset and views  the food options. You can also walk to Agios Gordios and Paramonas if you want to exercise after too much Greek food :) The accommodation was very clean  well-equipped  the bed very comfortable and the views magnificent. It was very refreshing to have an outside kitchen and to enjoy the views while eating. Thank you Jutka and Sofi for your hospitality and helpfulness!
43597921,Gunnar September 2022 This accommodation is so lovely and has a view you'd die for! A perfect place for relaxing and observing the sunset. Jutka  her husband  and Sofi are such lovely people. They were always there for us. Once our WiFi was lost because of a thunderstorm. They managed it alright after we'd informed them. We appreciate all your efforts. Thank you very much for hosting us. We really enjoyed our stay. We would have stayed longer if our holiday on Corfu Island had not come to an end.
43597921,Julia August 2022 We had a very enjoyable time at Jutkas place. The view from the terrace is stunning and we loved the town cats. Inside the apartment you can find everything you need. Beautiful town and nice beaches within reach. Thanks a lot for having us.
43597921,Jérémy August 2022 The accommodation is spacious and clean with eveything needed inside. Located in an authentic Greek village and the vew from balcony is amazing !! Jukta is a very kind person and helped us to find the best beach spots!
43597921,Richard En Audrey August 2022 A beautiful house with an ameezing view! We had wonderful dinners at the taverna!
43597921,Aleza July 2022 It was a great experience in Jutka‘s Villa. The view is breathtaking. Very clean apartment  everything you need is there. Sofia was great help!
43597921,Brian July 2022 Place was more or less faultless. Beautiful views from the balcony. Although we are cat lovers only thing I'd change would be putting something in place to keep the cats out. Better pillows as well maybe.
43597921,Lea July 2022 This place is absolutly beautiful ! we had an amazing time and Sofia is super kind.  Please note that it is quite excentred  I would advise to rent a car or a quad (as the road are a little difficult)
43597921,Daniel June 2022 Sofia was very kind and helpful wherever it was possible :) Communication was fast and easy
43597921,Isobelle June 2022 Amazing place to stay! So peaceful and quiet with amazing views. Only thing I could say is make sure you get a bike or car to get yourself up the hill!
43597921,Guy June 2022 Jutka‘s place is as fabulous as you can expect from the pictures! We spent a lovely (but too short) time enjoying the spectacular view from the terrasse  including the sunset  and the well equipped outdoor kitchen. We also enjoyed the quiet location  the friendly village people and the local food in Pentati village. Communication with Sofi was excellent. I can highly recommend this place for a perfectly relaxing holiday stay.
43597921,Adam June 2022 Jutka’s space is the perfect place for traveling solo or as a couple. As an up front warning  it’s a little confusing to find (30-40 min drive from Corfu town) but Jutka is always available by phone if you do get lost. Pictures don’t do this property/view justice. It is honestly breathtaking and worth a stay of at least 5 days. We were crushed to have to leave after 3.  The room is clean  the kitchen is fully equipped (even has a a juicer which we made fresh mimosas with) and the wifi was strong enough to take video calls which we both utilized since we work remotely. In all  this was a lovely home to explore an even more lovely island. We will stay again.
43597921,Katja May 2022 Most beautiful place we ever stayed in. Like paradise! Super comfy bed  the view (!!!)  outdoor kitchen <3 Cutest village  nicest people  not touristy  we felt like living in the neighborhood :) Car recommended. We hope to come back one day
43597921,Julia April 2022 Villa Scarlett is perfect for anyone wanting peace with a stunning view  even from the bathroom the view is breathtaking. The place is spotlessly clean and there are lots of extra bedding and towels should you need them  everything you would require (and more) to cook meals. Although there are 2 excellent Tavernas ( one of which is no.1 on Tripadvisor) in the village within walkable distance. Watching the sunset sitting in the egg chair with that panaramic view is unbeatable  we even saw dolphins swimming in the bay. Book this place  you won't be disappointed!
43597921,Dana April 2022 Staying at Scarlett‘s Villa was a true pleasure! Sofi and Scarlett were super friendly and the Check-In worked well. The apartment was clean and waking up to that view was awesome! Pentati is a cute little village with two tavernas and a mini market you can reach in a few minutes by foot. By far one of the most beautiful places I‘ve stayed so far!
43597921,Michaela September 2021 What a beautiful and quiet place! The perfect spot for sunsets! Very comfortable bed and nice seats outside. Highly recommended if you just like looking at the sea for hours :)
43597921,Annika September 2021 THIS VIEW!!!!! The apartment is perfectly clean  has cute interior and the view is the best ever! Beautiful sunrise/ sunset! It is very secluded though  you need a scooter or car to get to the village but it’s really authentic. Two nice restaurants in the village. Communication was great  I had anlogt of questions and Sofia was always quick to answer. Thank you so much for this stay!!!
43597921,Max August 2021 We had a really nice stay. Thank you very much! :)
43597921,Desirée August 2021 Great location  absolute tranquility and very well equipped apartment! The terrace is the perfect place to wnjoy the sunset and the beautiful scenery of the western coast! Would definitely recommend the place & would love to come back. Parking was outside of the village bit was not a problem even now during high season.
43597921,Cas August 2021 very good !
43597921,Mihai July 2021 A quaint and very clean place
43597921,Johannes June 2021 Its a really nice and cozy Apartment with impressive view over Agios Gordos Bay. The terrace ist really nice and has a lot of space to eat  chill  rest.  We loved it and will come again for sure :) Response from Jutka July 2021 Always Welcome!
43597921,Gilbert June 2021 Great view. Great location for exploring central and southern Corfu. We loved the outdoor kitchen. Everything is Close by while sitting on the terrace. Great Communication with Jutka.
43597921,Isabel June 2021 We had the best stay at Villa Scarlet ! Jutka and her husband are the kindest and very welcoming. The apartment has the most beautiful view and is super cozy! It’s located in a sweet village with the best Greek tavernas and the friendliest people ! :-) We will definitely come back ! 🥰 Thanks for our beautiful vacation ♥️ Response from Jutka June 2021 Always Welcome ❤️
43597921,Nicole June 2021 This was a wonderful stay in small village on Corfu. The balcony has an amazing view of the ocean. The hosts were very nice  responsive  and helpful. I highly recommend this stay.
43597921,Jorien May 2021 What a great place!! Clean  nice shower and bed  all the things you need are there  nice small village with two good tavernas  10min driving from Agios Gordios and most importantly: an amazing view right from your own terrace! Jutka and Sofia were very friendly and helped us if we needed anything. We will definitely be back! Response from Jutka May 2021 Good Evening. You people are always welcome to Pentati. God bless both of you.
43597921,Hugo May 2021 We had a very good time in Pentati village.  The view is stunning  the bedroom is all you need to relax. The place is a bit tricky by road but you can find beaches  restaurant and any kind of activity for less than 20 min ride by car.  The host are very friendly and quiet  and can be of any help if needed.  We really recommande this stay.
43597921,Margot September 2020 The apartment is all you need! Perfect view  perfect host and perfect equipment! Located around 35min to corfou center  it is perfect with a rental car.  Thanks jukta for your welcome in Pentati!
43597921,Thiana September 2020 This place is a beautiful place to stay for a few nights. It’s a small place but very comfy and sparkly clean. The view is amazing and it is close to the beach. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. It was a joy to stay there!
43597921,Denis August 2020 It was the best stay of all Airbnb’s that I have. The owner was ready to help everytime and gave us tips to travel and to eat. The place is fantastic in a very quiet and safe area. stunning view! Super! Just one advice: maybe so write down on the airbnb page the local coordinates or the meeting point before check in (Café bar and bus station or in my opinion it will be better to meet at a place that google maps has like one of the tavernas for example. Good food in this area as well. It was a fantastic time. The equipment of the room was perfect. Even towels  drinks  Desinfektion ... was available. Thank you for everything ! Would come again if I visit corfu again.
43597921,Thaneshan August 2020 It has magnificent views from every corner of the house. Jutka and her husband are very helpful and provided useful hints on travelling around  eating out and buying things (fruits  vegetables and daily needs). Pentati has it own beauty of quite surrounding and friendly people  one could also try some traditional food there  and buy local products like vegetables or eggs from local shop at Pentati. I had a wonderful stay there  if I will have another opportunity to come back to Corfu  I’ll definitely think about stying there again.
43597921,Annika August 2020 Amazing view and perfect for sunsets!!! Great outdoor space!! Super nice little village with two restaurants  we only visited one of them because we fell in love with it the first evening  so there was no point of checking out the other. :) We rented a Scooter so we could go directly to the house but if you rent a car you have to park it on the Main Street and walk for like 2 min. Only annoying thing are the wesps but they are everywhere and not that aggressive. Also Jutka gave us some stuff against them so it was fine.
43597921,Kate August 2020 Jutka's beautiful place and the incredible view from her balcony made our trip to Corfu. We enjoyed the peaceful vibe in Pentati and left rested and happy. Response from Jutka August 2020 What's important to me is that my guest enjoys their stay. God bless ! Translated  Show original
43597921,William July 2020 This place is very peaceful and the view is splendid  jutka and his husband are so sympathic. I recommend this place.
43597921,"Annette October 2022 A jewel in the absolutely quiet ""panoramic zone"" of the mountain village of Pentati far from the tourist hustle. Here  the Greek village life still works: a mini market and 3 taverns are available! We ate extremely well especially with Sofi and her family at ""I Strophi"".  Various beaches are easy to reach as a hike or by car. However  it is also recommended to rent a car (as small as possible!) at the airport.  We will be happy to come back!

43597921,Samuel August 2022 We recommend this accommodation 200% with my partner  a superb apartment with a breathtaking view like we have never seen in our life  the accommodation has all the possible and expected options to feel good  a beautiful village and a note to tell you that the host Sofia is a great person with a heart on hand  who holds a restaurant a few meters away or we eat in an excellent way  with a very wide variety of dishes and a family atmosphere. Translated from French  Show original
43597921,"Jessi May 2022 Reviewing the apartment is not so easy  if you would rate the terrace on your own  you could smoothly distribute 10*. It doesn't get any better than this. The apartment itself is more of a ""room""  measured by a standard hotel room with shower. It is functional and has everything you need. The kitchen has been placed to the outside. We had 14 days of great weather and so also enjoyed the time with the outdoor kitchen. In bad weather it becomes difficult  but when do you have it in Corfu? The communication with Juttka was always very fast and if you had wishes  these were quickly fulfilled. Parking in itself is not available in the village  as is common in the mountain villages  you have to squeeze yourself somewhere to the side. The two tavernas in the village are highly recommended  with Angela's taverns being a little more quaint. You can choose to eat in the kitchen and the host is super hospitable. ATTENTION  one should be mentioned. There are several cats in the house that you can't escape  they are sweet  but if you don't like that they are there all the time or have a cat allergy  you should consider this well. Because of the terrace we had fantastic hours and experienced enchanting sunsets. All in all  a beautiful accommodation in a mountain village with the best views ""ever.""

50967191,Alexander October 2022 we can highly recommend Dimitra's apartment. if you want to relax and love the sea  this is the place for you. Dimitra is a very friendly and personable hostess. 5 Stars!
50967191,Naomi September 2022 A wonderful experience in Corfu! The house is wonderful! Perfect location  clean and tidy. Dimitra was thinking about every small detail  helped us with every question  and were available every time we needed her. The hospitality gave us the feeling of visiting a good friend and the room high maintenance made us feel like in a five stars hotel  Hope to come back soon!
50967191,Kinga September 2022 Dimitra’s place was one of the most amazing places we stayed in. Adding up Dimitra’s great heart this is the must stay location. It’s just right next to the beach  has an amazing view  and the sea is just few steps away. It is so close to the beach and sun beds yet you have all privacy you may need. Just right the corner there is a restaurant where you may have nice dinner and in a short walking distance you have few small markets. All you need is around. When we came Dimitra welcomed us  showed the house and told all the details regarding the neighborhood. House is so well equipped that all you need is your clothes:) If you are starving after a journey no worries - Dimitra also took care of the welcoming food:) All thought out. All the small and big things that are done by this host made us feel great. From the flat furbish and equipment to the process of welcoming and saying good bye to the guests: everything was great. Thank you Dimitra!!:)
50967191,Yannis August 2022 saying everything was perfect is an understatement! thank you Dimitra you are the best host!!!
50967191,Anna August 2022 Dimitra is a very kind person who took really care of us. The apartment is brand new rebuild  the terrasse is well furnished  everything was prepared for us four  even food for the next day as we arrived late on Saturday night. The apartment is convenient as it gives on the beach. The beach is very big  quite wild  really worth it  with restaurants along the beach and one very trendy.
50967191,Johannes June 2022 We spent our Honeymoon at this beautiful apartment and had a fantastic time. The apartment is even more beautiful in real as the pictures can show. The garden is beautifully taken care of and offers an amazing view and you can be at the beach in no time. The beach is very beautiful and sandy and was not too crowded during our stay in June. Great restaurants are near by and the beach also offers lots of water sports options. Dimitra is the nicest host you could imagine  she gave us many great tips for sightseeing  restaurants  beaches and so on and really helped us easily find the best spots. The apartment was very clean  and is very stylish. If it gets too warm the AC works great. We would stay here again any time.
50967191,Charlie June 2022 Our stay exceeded expectations from the second we arrived to the second we left!  Before we even arrived  Dimitra was so helpful and responsive with questions we had about our stay. When we arrived we were greeted and shown around. The apartment was very clean  and the views were amazing. Dimitra and her parents have thought of everything that we would possibly ever need! The thought of traveling with a 14-month old was slightly overwhelming  but our hosts made it as easy as it could be. There was a baby bath  shampoo  toys  a cot and blankets for her.  The location itself is amazing! Just 30 seconds from the beach was perfect with a baby.  All in all  our stay was perfect and we have been recommending it to everyone we know! We would jump at the chance to stay again.
50967191,Christoph June 2022 We had such a great time at the Melody house. It is so close to the beach that you hear the waves from the living room. The house has everything you need and it’s so beautiful watching the sea from the terrace. Dimitra and her parents are really nice people. We stayed there with our 5 months old son and they had everything we needed for our baby like a baby bed and a small baby bathtub. And they even bought baby books just for our little baby. So nice and attentive. The beach is beautiful and not too busy. Great for a relaxed family holidays. But you’ll better have a car for restaurants and groceries shopping as the places on the beach are too expensive and not so good. But you can find good restaurants in Pelekas only 10 minutes by car and Corfu town is not that far neither. We highly recommend this house. Thanks Dimitra and Georgia for the hospitality!
50967191,Juste May 2022 Apartments was really wonderful! Lovely place to stay for calm holiday with a family or friends. Everything was great-place  beach near apartments  garden and especially many thanks to the host! Thank you one more time! :)
50967191,Daniel November 2021 the location is wonderful  but you should have a rental car. the accommodation is as described in the pictures and so we are very satisfied.  the hosts are friendly and there were even a few small gifts. we would come back anytime  which is the biggest compliment.
50967191,Uladzislau October 2021 A wonderful and stylish house. Everything is done with taste; there are many things for your comfort (even a flashlight for walking along the shore at night  board games  toaster  etc.). The hosts are very hospitable and friendly. When they asked for ideas for improvement  we couldn't even find an answer. The sea view is lovely  thanks to the terrace you can enjoy it even in bad weather.
50967191,Charlotte October 2021 I am not sure what is better - the location or the apartment. The property has been beautifully renovated and every last touch has been considered. From the bed linen to the garden  the beach towels and beach gear to the cooking utensils  games  sun loungers  deck chairs - you name it  it is there. There was water and fresh fruit for when we arrived and two umbrellas including one for our toddler as there was some rain forecast. The host went to such trouble for our little one  a lovely little cot ( not travel cot)  bath products and towels / linens for her and a new high chair…really we were blown away. And the apartment is literally on the beach. The sound of the waves  out the gate and you are in the sea in a minute. The hosts father dropped off some home made red wine which was brilliant and they were all so welcoming and helpful. I could not recommend this place highly enough for a single  couple or couple with a little one. It really is a little piece of heaven.
50967191,Devlin September 2021 We loved our stay at this special spot! Dimitri and her family are great hosts and the location was perfect - from verandah to swim in about 10 seconds! The photos listed are just what we experienced.  Everything was very comfortable and clean with good quality bedding and towels.  We appreciated the extra attention to detail in the beach mats  umbrella and kitchen extras and toiletries. Our host even dropped off home made wine 🙌🏼  We will never forgot morning coffees in the deck chairs and sunsets out of a postcard.  Thank you!
50967191,Will August 2021 This place is what Airbnb is all about. It is an amazing place which has just been done up to the highest standard. The garden is amazing. You never really need to leave other than to walk the 10 metres for a swim. The beach is great here and the sea is beautiful and calm. We stayed with our 9 month old and it was perfect for her. Demetra and her family could not do anymore for us and even bought a little toy for us. It is right next to a really nice restaurant. There is a decent shop with all the essentials and fresh bread in the mornings. A little down the beach there is a beach bar that is more lively with an amazing ice cream place behind. Overall we had the most amazing week here and would recommend it to everyone. Such a special place!
50967191,Thies November 2022 Dimitra is a wonderful host and she also catered to our children. Her apartment was very comfortably furnished and very clean. The location is perfect because you can't get any closer to the beach. In November we had the beach almost to ourselves.

50967191,Boaz September 2022 Dimitria's place is the perfect place for a family vacation. We were with little kids and the apartment was incredibly equipped for us. Games for children Sea equipment Light refreshments and a bottle of wine. Dimitria's mom even dropped off her souvenir shirts for the kids from Corfu. Excellent tavernas in the nearby village. Thankyou so much Dimitria for an amazing stay. Translated from Hebrew  Show original
50967191,Bárbara September 2022 The apartment is beachfront  you go directly to the sand. Super well equipped inside  it has everything and everything works perfectly  and the owners add everything you can imagine (small appliances  water and fruit  personal hygiene products  even some toys for the children!) Dimitra is super friendly  she always offered to help us organize our stay on the island as best as possible. We would repeat it without hesitation! Translated from Spanish  Show original

23939683,Chris July 2021 We occupied the ground floor unit for a week  which includes a seating area to the front of the house  but not the lovely rear garden which belongs to the first floor apartment. The place was clean and well equipped  and we enjoyed eating outside watching the village life. there are some derelict units on both sides which might put some people off but semi derelict buildings seem to be everywhere in Corfu  as are feral cats. We really enjoyed our stay. The locals are friendly and you can walk to the bars and restaurants and so on. you'll need a car  and therefore nerves of steel to navigate some of the minor roads. overall we had a great time and would heartily recommend this apartment Response from Ioannis July 2021 Thank you  Chris  and thanks for taking such good care of the house  also! We are happy you and your family enjoyed your stay at my place and in Corfu  but it's a shame you didn't get to enjoy the backyard at all. It isn't exclusive to the other apartment and maybe we should put a second table and chairs to make it more obvious. Hopefully  if you return  you' ll enjoy it next time! ☺️ Show more
23939683,Felix July 2021 very nice place Response from Ioannis July 2021 We are very happy you enjoyed your time at our place and I hope we see you again!
23939683,Oisin June 2021 I don't know if the stay at Ioannis' place could have been better. The welcome from his family  the warm conversations  and the beautiful terraces made my month-long stay a dream. It was very laid back  very easy going  and had everything I needed. Response from Ioannis June 2021 Thank you so much  Osh  for your kind words! Looking forward to meeting you ourselves next time you come and spend some time together  as well! 😊
23939683,Joanne August 2020 Ioannis is indeed a superhost! Communication fantastic  helpful tips for the area & apartment and he even picked us up from the airport. We had the ground floor apartment. It has a big terrace at the front which gets the wonderful sun in the morning. Also a quieter rear terrace at the back. It’s a spacious apartment with very efficient Air con. Lots of storage space  big fridge freezer (inside they left us some wonderful home made jams and a bottle of homemade wine) washing machine if you need. Great shower. Everything you would need. Ioannis parents were on holiday too staying in the apartment above and were also super friendly even baking us an apple pie cake.... just lovely.  Location is in the village centre with restaurants & bars literally up the street. Pelekas has several great restaurants so make sure you follow the road up & around the hill. Amazing 360 degree views from the Kaiser’s chair at the top and THE best place to see the sunset from the restaurant next to it.  A few beaches close by to the town (we went to Pelekas beach) and they had bars/ restaurants on them for lunch/ drinks & plenty of sun beds. Be warned it is a very steep road down to the beaches. It is walkable in good shoes (25 mins?) but the walk back uphill is a little hard going in the heat. Perhaps rent a scooter or a small car? Parking is possible down the road from the apartment too. Bus into Corfu town is cheap & efficient - departure times are random & many changes because of Covid so check local notices. Get your bus ticket from the shop around the corner and it’s cheaper.  All in all we loved the mountain village of Pelekas and would happily recommend and return. Show more
23939683,Aaron August 2020 Ioannis's apartment is brilliantly located in one of the most beautiful villages in Corfu. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything you could need. The terrace overlooks the bustling main street of the village and you can even have your dinner delivered by the Pelekas Grill next door. We decided that we definitely had the best table in Pelekas!  Ioannis gave us some great tips for places to eat  beaches etc and we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with him and his wife. I'd have no hesitation recommending a stay at Ioannis's apartment. Response from Ioannis September 2020 Thank you so much for your enthusiastic review! We were also very glad to host you and your family and hope we have a second chance to meet again at a covid-free time  where we would be able to have a bbq competition! 😉 Best wishes to you all  Yannis & Fani.

23939683,Christa September 2019 Even we were in this appartment only 2 nights we had a great time there. the appartment is really nice  lot of space  a wounderful garden and also a really nice sitting area in front of the house. and on top Ioannis was one of the best host we ever had. one highlight we didnt expect was spending an evening with him  his girlfriend  aunt and uncle with lots of great food and interesting conversation. And also the fridge was filled with nice things to eat. we can really recommend this appartment and would love to come back. Pelekas was a nice little village with lots of restaurants around. but we really recommend a rental car for getting arround. Response from Ioannis September 2019 Thank you so much for all your kind words! It was also a pleasure for me hosting you and although I understand you don't usually return to the same place twice  it would be great to see you again sometime (maybe when Julian is a little older...)! Happy travels!!! Show more
23939683,Krzysztof July 2019 Ioannis's apartment is located in Pelekas - beautiful little town on the western part of the island. There are a few restaurants in the city  bakery and the small (a little overpriced) supermarket. It's a good starting point to visit the whole island  especially part on the west side of the coast. Plenty of little cute beaches in about 20 minutes by car.  The place itself is well equiped  all rooms have AC  there is a wifi connection as well. Apartment is based on the ground floor  though is a little dark but in 30+ celcius degrees this can be a plus for some people. It has two cute terraces that you can use by yourself - one from the front  the second one in a very nice private garden. Everything is provided  so you get full equiped kitchen (Ioannis provided us some water  snacks and fruits)  there is an iron board with ironing machine  washing machine and beach umbrella with few mats. Overally I would recommend the place if you want to enjoy local Corfu village life and you rent a car to check the island. Convenient location  big space that can easily accommodate 6 people  air conditioning and few little touches from the owners. Efharistò Ioannis! Show more Response from Ioannis August 2019 Thank you Krzysztof for your nice words! I'm happy you enjoyed your stay at my place and explored everyday a new Beach! See you on your next visit to Corfú! Best wishes!

23939683,Timm September 2018 We had a great Week in the House. Ioannis is a great Host. We are looking forward to come back.
23939683,Chloe September 2018 Enjoyed a relaxing week at Ioannis' apartment in the centre of Pelekas. The outside space is what really makes the place  particularly the beautiful terraced back garden. Ioannis is a friendly and helpful host and Pelekas is a great place to stay without a car. You can walk down to the lovely Paleokastritsa and Glyfada beaches (the walk back is definitely good exercise!) and up to the Kaiser's Throne for a stunning sunset view (especially good with an ouzo or Mythos). And Corfu Town makes a good day trip on the bus. Hope to return one day!
23939683,Lauren September 2018 Ioannis's place is located in pelakas which is about 30 mins away from the city of Corfu. it's a cute little area with everything you need   much quieter than in the bustle of Corfu. the apartment has everything you need. I would definitely recommend staying here! I would also recommend trying pelakas grill 2 doors down for the most delicious gyros!
23939683,Claudio August 2018 I came to Pelekas with my wife and my children (4 and 2 years old). Everything was just perfect: the house and its fittings  the location and  most of all  the host! Ioannis has became a real friend: for personal reasons I had to report my holidays the day I was supposed to arrive at Ioannis' place. He had been absolutely helpful and did everything to not make lost my reservation. In addition  we had a fantastic time chatting with him and his wonderful family  we even got invited for a fantastic Greek dinner together! The apartment is very comfortable and has two different outdoor spaces with tables and chairs where you can enjoy your meals. Of course the house was clean  beds comfortable  air conditioned in the bedrooms... what more can I say? I would recommend this place over and over again! I have now some very good friends in Corfu! Thank you Ioannis!
23939683,Simon August 2018 Ioannis's flat is very well located in the centre of the village. There are shops  cafes and ATM very close by. We did not have a car but were able to get around very easily. The beach is walkable from the flat (about 20 minutes downhill and a bit longer on the way back) and there is a great viewpoint above the village which we walked to. There is also a good bus service to Corfu Town from the village. We really enjoyed our stay in Ioannis's flat. It is spacious and has two lovely outdoor eating areas - one in a very nice private garden at the back of the house and another at the front of the house looking out over the village. The air-conditioning worked well and we were very comfortable. Ioannis was an excellent host - he met us and gave us lots of useful local information and some very nice homemade biscuits  but also gave us plenty of privacy. Response from Ioannis September 2018 Thank you Simon  Jo  Sam and Katie for taking the risk to book my house without earlier comments! As I understood the place exceeded your expectations and I am very pleased hearing that! One of the project's plan is to host families with kids and yours was a good test. The lack of a car did not bother you because your family has an adventurous spirit and you had the chance to explore the nature around Pelekas and also the culture and local history of Corfu. Thank you for your kind words regarding me. I try to be discreet  friendly and helpful with my guests. I am looking forward to seeing you guys again and hope we 'll enjoy a barbeque at your next visit !!! My mother is happy that u liked the jam and she says that has more home made jam to offer to you  and my uncle is waiting to give you a tour at the museum of Mon Repos  the birthplace of prince Charles.

Ioannis is the perfect host. He was there to greet us and was super helpful. We ended up spending a few nights drinking wine and chatting  and learned a lot about Greek culture. I highly recommend staying here! Response from Ioannis August 2018 Thank you Carlos for your kind words. I am very glad you liked the house and my company! I also enjoyed the nights we spend in the front yard chatting like old friends. Next time you come  we will test what you both learned about Greece. I am looking forward to seeing you soon Carlos and Cristine! Show more
23939683,Julian JuJu July 2018 Loannis was an amazing host. Helpful  respectful and very kind. Even welcomed us with Homemade wine & Fresh Fruit. House was clean  and the A/C offered in both rooms was a nice touch battling the hot summer days. Corfu is a small village with an amazing community that really embraces you as their family. Lots of great local restaurants to choose from and a beach located 5 mins from the house. Great view of the sunset at the top of the village. The centre of Corfu Town is approximately 20 mins away and about 25 mins away from the airport. I highly recommend staying here 10/10 Response from Ioannis August 2018 Thank you Julian for your nice words for my house  the people in the village and myself! I am glad that my hard work  renovating the house  satisfied you. Now you know the reason so many people visit Pelekas constantly the last 50 years. Ιts great that the appartment made you feel part of our micro-society. I hope I see you guys next summer !! Show more
23939683,Nikolay July 2018 Ioannis has recently renovated the first floor of his house which is right in the centre of the village Pelekas. Thus one can admire the movement of the people there while sitting on the spacious verranda. We particularly enjoyed the restaurant that is next door but first of all the hospitality  flexibility and open-heartednes of Ioannis. He met us personally on arrival and was waiting for us at 2 o'clock in the night ;-) Thank you Ioannis. Response from Ioannis August 2018 I thank you Nikolay for choosing my place and your comments. I wish all following guests will behave like you and your family. I am glad that I met you guys and I wish we had more time to discuss several issues that would bring us closer.

23939683,Anita Joseph June 2018 If you are a traveller  you value hospitality  cleanliness and value. Of course  having the perfect holiday location is the most important. The Village of Pelekas has the most beautiful of Corfu's summer sunsets over a sandy beach. Yes  sand! The apartment is located up the hill from the beach and receives pleasant breezes throughout the day and night. Breakfast in the back garden  under the lemon and kumquat trees  with the fragrance of jasmine  and sip a glass of wine while people-watching on the large front patio gardens in the mid-afternoon  and before an evening trip to the beach. We had 5 in the apartment and plenty of privacy. A fully stocked kitchen and many nearby restaurants  cafes  bakeries and markets helped us while away the evenings with delicious food and great conversation with friends. Enough comfortable outdoor chairs for 12! Bring good walking shoes  because you will to explore. Our host went to great lengths to add small touches that make a big difference  but nothing can replace how friendly  responsive  honest and inviting he is. House rules to remember: Rinse sandy shoes outside and be gentle and respectful with appliances and fixtures. This was a family home and the fine dishes are generously provided for tenant use. Air conditioning in every room and good water pressure in the shower are added features that we didn't find at other lodgings. A washing machine and a drying rack (plenty of sun) was also helpful. The life is easy in Pelekas and we immediately felt like we lived there. There are regular buses to Corfu town and a tour office by the bakery  but we really found everything we wanted in Pelekas. We will definitely return to this place  again and again. Book early! Show more Response from Ioannis June 2018 Wow Anita !!! Thanks for your superb words and all info/rules that you provided. I am greatful to guests like you and your family. Looking forward to seeing you !! Show more
23939683,Nuria August 2022 The flat is the first floor of a house  with a front porch and back garden  in the center of the village Pelekas.

23939683,Peter August 2021 A wonderful apartment on the lowest floor of a three-storey house. We stayed in the middle of the nice and authentic mountain village of Pelekas. In the front a large terrace to watch the village life. On the backside is a wonderfully green garden that smells of herbs. The apartment itself was super clean. Only the one or the other piece of furniture could be renewed slowly.  On the top floor Ioannis' uncle lives with his family - extremely nice people!  Pelekas is perfectly located to reach the whole island - in a few minutes you can reach the great beaches of the area and in 15 minutes you are in the city  at the ferry and at the airport. Despite the high season  we usually had the parking space in front of the house - or close by. We had a really wonderful holiday - not least thanks to this perfect place to stay. Translated from German  Show original Response from Ioannis August 2021 Thank you very much for the detailed and detailed review and the information very helpful for other guests! My uncle  as well as the whole family  were also very happy to have met you!

23939683,Hans-Georg October 2020 We spent 14 wonderful days in the house of Iannis in the middle of Pelkas. We had the whole lower floor of the house as well as the huge terrace in front for us and in addition seating in the back of the garden. Everything in the house was perfect. In addition to the usual service  there were homemade jams  homemade wine  water  coffee  tea  milk.... for us. The location is ideal for exploring the island even without your own car. We have reached three beautiful beaches on foot as well as the capital and other villages and beaches by bus. We would come back any time  possibly even with both grandchildren  the second bedroom we do not use is perfect for that. Our favorite place to stay was the sunny large terrace in front overlooking the sea towards the city.

23939683,Shanshan August 2019 This is a lovely house  the apartment is on the ground floor  sharing the front and rear gardens with guests upstairs  enough privacy and interaction.Comfortable room  clean environment  fully equipped  even condiments and medicine  we felt very convenient to cook our own meals there.In particular  the host is very welcoming. Due to the difficulty of renting a car  they picked us up from the airport to the house and invited us to a dinner that night  then offered to take us to the beach  help us with car rental and advice on places to visit.The recommended Chlomos and the beaches👍 in the south are very nice. The location is very convenient to go anywhere on the island by car  and it is easy to walk to the Kaiser King at the top of the hill to watch the sunset  so it is great to have a drink there for dinner.However  it is still recommended to drive to the nearest beach because it is a wonderful experience to walk along the trail of Banshan in the heat of the sun on the way back. Overall it was a very happy stay and both the owner and the house itself made it unforgettable.

53642777,Marco September 2022 Had a Great Time. I can highly recommend the accommodation! Beautiful view and nice Pool area. Just sometimes a little windy.
53642777,Josephine September 2022 Wow  what a villa 🤩  If you a contemplating booking then hit the button as this is an absolute gem!!!  The villa is gorgeous  with everything you could hope for. It’s spacious with lots of communal areas for a group to lounge around in  The pool has sun all day long  with a couple of covered areas you can sneak off too when it gets a bit hot  We didn’t hire a car and in hindsight I would 100% recommend you do. The villa is very high up a mountain with steep windy roads all the way down. If you are unsteady on your feet it may not be the best place for you if you don’t have a car  You can get taxis  but they are very expensive…about €20 euros per trip  which soon adds up (especially if you need more than one)  We’d recommend either going shopping in corfu town on the way from the airport as there aren’t any big supermarkets close. There are some small ones which have all the essentials  but they are pricey  The bedrooms were big with comfy beds and plenty of bathrooms. We were a group of 6 and had lots of space  Rita and her husband were excellent hosts who did everything they could to make our holiday special  All in all we had the BEST week away and would certainly return Show more
53642777,Ben August 2022 An amazing place  beautifully created. Every amenity and comfort has been thought about. We really couldn't have wished for a better place to stay. The location is perfect too - very close to Kassiopi and San Stefanos - in between the two. But with great shops nearby as well. Rita was incredible at looking after us  and helping us find our way around the local area. We would highly recommend this place to anyone. Perfect for both families and adults alike. We would book again in a flash (if we can find availability!).
53642777,Lisa August 2022 Amazing villa which has been beautifully decorated. The owners were very helpful. The location is perfect and quiet.
53642777,Jonas June 2022 Rita did the suggestion and also reservation for our boats tour  which was awesome! Also the house looked in reality even better than in the pictures  what is really difficult. Rita was a very great host!
53642777,Virginia June 2022 We had the most incredible stay at Sinium Villa. The Villa itself was so beautiful and had absolutely everything you could possibly need. The views are spectacular. The pool was incredible and well needed after some Corfu sun. Rita and George were amazing with information and made us feel so welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. You will definitely need a car (and one with a good clutch!) as the surrounding area is worth exploring and the hills are windy. We hired a boat from Agni Bay and that was a must-do experience. We walked down to Agni Bay a few times too but if you want a drink then you’ll need a taxi home as the hills are very steep back up! One of our best and most relaxing holidays ever.
53642777,Frederik May 2022 Absolutely amazing house with a stunning view and nice hosts. Astrit and Rita have created a truly perfect holiday stay. The house has everything you need for a nice relaxing week away. Everything was clean and in great condition. We hope to be back soon!
53642777,Felix October 2022 For my family and friends it was an impressive time at the villa. The morning sunrise over Albania  the sunset behind our house slope  the starry sky with several shooting stars  the pool area with all-day sun  very secluded and therefore very quiet to relax  breakfast and cooking in a super equipped kitchen  the luxury with a private bathroom in the sleeping area (3 of the 4 bedrooms have a shower room)  the romantic bathtub in the 4th bathroom. The ambiance and design of the interior of the house exudes so much love and passion. This is where the builder has thought about it. The lighting concept is also impressive and invites you to linger. You need/should rent a car! It makes a lot easier and more comfortable. I would shop at Lidl's in Corfu city  as the mini supermarkets are very overpriced! Wine and snapps can be found 10 minutes by car from Vino & Spirits - the selection is impressive. Rita and her husband are very loving people who do not leave you in the rain in case there are any problems. They were so engaged and accommodating to make our holiday something special!

24190849,Aidan August 2019 This is a beautiful villa which although part of a complex feels very private with wonderful views of the beach and sea. The part of the beach it overlooks is not busy even in peak times. The villa was spotlessly clean and well equipped. Hanna was very amenable and helpful. Why only 4 stars? - unfortunately there is a beach bar further up the beach that plays music between 4 and 8pm which is an annoyance  except on special events when it continues until 11pm and can be very noisy. Despite this I would still definitely recommend the villa. It was wonderful to get up in the morning for an early morning swim in the sea and to an empty beach.
24190849,Katharina September 2018 The house  garden and location are amazing!!Perfect for a relaxing holiday directly behind the sandy beach and with an incredible view over the sea! we liked it a lot! hanne is very friendly and makes everything possible (Babybed  babychair)Thank you!!

Hanne’s place is a wonderful experience and location is very strategic..
24190849,Eva October 2020 The beach house is situated in a beautiful bay with crystal clear water. We stayed here at the end of October and had great sunny weather. Swimming was a joy at 25 degrees water temperature. A stand-up board is part of the house. In the bay there is also a water sports rental  a small souvenir/grocery store and 1 restaurant. However  a rental car is definitely useful  as the bay is quite remote and the real shopping facilities are a bit away. The beach house with its garden is nicely decorated and there is nothing missing. We were able to relax superbly  enjoy a fantastic sunset every day and would come back any time.

24190849,Andreas August 2020 Anne's house fully meets expectations. You are first row walk-free right on the beach. The house is part of a larger complex  which does not bother at all. From your own lawn you can go directly into the sea  which is flat and equipped with the best sand. On site there are 3 tavernas and a club  but it is much nicer in Pelekas  which goes up the mountain by car 5 minutes! Hanne was very nice and explained everything to us. There are 4 double rooms with 4 bathrooms (2 larger and 2 smaller ones each). Anytime again! Translated from German  Show original Response from Hanne August 2020 Andreas  I'm glad you enjoyed yourselves. Come back! Translated  Show original

24190849,Olga June 2019 Wonderful house and wonderful host! Translated from Russian  Show original Response from Hanne June 2019 Hello Olga thank you so much for your assessment!
24190849,Sofia April 2019 We spent a week with our two little daughters and grandparents. The house is in a great location. You can hear the sound of the sea in bed in the evening. The house offers plenty of space and just through the two floors also tranquility. The fine sandy beach right outside the door was optimal. In the kitchen  really everything is available. Even equipped with a great coffee machine! Hanne was very helpful and always responded quickly. We felt very comfortable and thank her for it! Translated from German  Show original
17978846,Andreas July 2022 Alexandros is without a doubt the most kindhearted and down to earth Airbnb host I've ever dealt with. He facilitated our stay and helped us with everything we needed to have a perfect time in Potamos. The house itself is stunning and has a natural connection to the beautiful nature surrounding it. To anyone looking for a well-managed house with a super professional host  I highly recommend this Airbnb!
17978846,Edwin July 2022 The house really has got everything you need to make your self comfortable. The pool is lovely and the airconditioning works well. The club  supermarket  public transport and beach are all within 20 mins of walking from the house. Next to that Alex is a great host who is willing to help you out with everything. We enjoyed our stay a lot.
17978846,Mark June 2022 The house is above and beyond what you expect and see from the pictures. Its a fantastic place to stay  and our group had a fantastic time. The location is great for party-goers as well with easy access to the bus stop to get into the city  and walking distance from some of the hottest clubs/bars in Corfu.  Alex is an incredible host. Very generous and understanding. He was very easy to contact throughout the whole trip and was quick to help us or give recommendations whenever we needed.
17978846,Fabio September 2021 This is a really sweet home near Corfù  that can comfortably fit 9 people. It's roomy and clean  with a nice well-maintained pool in the backyard  a big BBQ grill in the front yard... and a pool table that we used way more than we expected to. There's a TV and AC in each room  the ones in the living room and in the backyard are smart so you can also sign in with your Netflix or Disney+ account in order to watch the movies or TV series you like.  We rented some scooters  using them the house is about 5 minutes away from Corfù city and 20-30 minutes away from some beautiful beaches. I'd honestly recommend scooters over a car as they're more agile  you can more comfortably navigate through the small greek streets.  Overall this is a very good choice if you're looking for a place to stay with your friends in Corfù. Alex is also a very nice person  he immediately answered the many questions I had and went out of his way to solve the little problems we had. Recommended!
17978846,Alania August 2021 Alexandros is the kindest and most relaxed host you will ever meet. He was always available for help. From the beginning on he helped us to organize everything we needed. He even gave us a ride to supermarkets and a car-rental place. He gave us lots of great recommendations. The house is so cute and has everything you need. When you are bored you play a round of billiard or go swimming in the beautiful pool. It is also very cozy and clean. It was the perfect location for our trip  we would recommend it to everyone!!! 12/10
17978846,Sabrina June 2021 This property was exactly what we were looking for! It was 6 of us  staying for 8 days and we really enjoyed it. Alex is really an excellent host. He made us feel welcome and takes great care of the property. The pool was excellent and the billiards table was another great bonus. I would absolutely recommend this house to everyone visiting Corfu.
17978846,Ben September 2020 Alex was great. So helpful throughout our trip  and the villa itself is nice with a good pool. Only 10 minutes or so in a taxi into Corfu town  so a decent location too
17978846,Thorsten August 2020 We had a really good time at Alexandro's place. Everything was great  the house is clean  spatious and has nice pool. Easy to explore the island from this place. Much recommend!
17978846,Viktoriia August 2020 Alex is very helpful. The villa is great! Very quiet place . Location is superb  very close to city Centre and beautiful beaches. Excellent value for money.
17978846,James June 2019 Alexandros is an excellent host with a splendid place. It was the perfect house for me and my 5 friends to go and chill out for a few days in Corfu while we take in the sun. The pool is the perfect temperature and we never got bored with playing pool or watching the smart TV. Although the nearest shop is 15 min walk away  it’s nice to stroll though the area and get some exercise. Alex answered all questions we had and made sure we had everything we needed to make the stay the best it could be.
17978846,Md Shafiqur April 2018 The property was very spacious clean and secure. The house had everything we needed. We had 5 children and they all loved it because of the extra space. The host Alex was very helpful and always was only a phone call away. The property was a bit of walking distance from the local transport/bus route. Nonetheless  it was a pleasant walk and we didnt mind. Alex provided us with initial drinking bottle waters as tap water was not drinkable. He also brought us further bottle waters during Easter holiday as we were not able to buy any from local shops. Alex was efficient in terms of picking us and droping us back to the Airport. We enjoyed our holiday and will recomend our friends and families without hasitation.
17978846,Andreas October 2020 Alexandros was a great host. The accommodation corresponded to the information we were very satisfied Translated from German  Show original
17978846,Simoné August 2020 Very nice host  great experience  house met expectations and wonderful island with a very warm population! Thank you to Alex who was very available and gave good advice throughout our stay !! Translated from French  Show original
11996314,Ella September 2022 Lovely house with beautiful views - would definitely recommend. The hosts were friendly and communication was quick and easy. I would try to stick to the larger supermarkets instead of the small local ones - very expensive :) Angi Bay is beautiful and full of lovely restaurants too.

11996314,Elle October 2021 Villa Regina was perfect and had everything we needed. Spectacular views from the pool looking down towards Agni bay. We ate at all the local restaurants and highly recommend nikolas tavern for dinner and Korina’s kitchen for breakfast or cocktails. It is a very steep walk back up the hill but worth it! After renting a boat Agni bay is definitely the best bay along the north east coast. Response from Sofronios October 2021 Dear Elle.

11996314,Lucy October 2020 We loved our stay at Villa Regina  we spent lots of time chilling in the villa during the day at enjoyed bbqing in the evenings. Going out of season meant most of the restaurants in Agni were closed  however we made friends with the locals in Kalami who were really helpful and gave lots of recommendations! We didn’t rent a car which worked for us  however the walk up to the villa is very hilly so might not suit everyone. Be sure to visit Super Mario and Dimitri’s!

11996314,Amir October 2020 The pictures do not do good to this place since the view and outdoors is by far more amazing. 1 remarkable thing you'll understand when you are there = the infinity pool is designed exactly in the shape of the BAY itself ... amazing....simple architecture at its best ❤️ Response from Sofronios October 2020 Dear Amir  Hello from Eos Villas.

11996314,Asaf September 2020 If you come with kids  don’t go there. Too many stairs and the access is very dangerous. The villa divided to 2 separate houses. Without door between- not comfortable. The bathrooms are disgusting. Water didn’t flash.
11996314,Zivile October 2019 To be short and precise we have really enjoyed our stay at Villa Regina. It gave us memorable moments while sitting outside in the evening and looking into the sea. View was magnificent and relaxing one. Also I want to emphasize that route into this villa is not the simplest one  but you will get used to it quite quickly. It has some steep hills and some sharp turns  but it's manageable. Parking space is quite narrow so consider renting smaller cars as I don't think you will place bigger one there or at least it will be some kind of a game to do that. Villa has everything you need for your stay (they even managed to get us child bed and chair). House has two floors  but they are not connected from the inside. We have considered this as an advantage - it gave some intimacy for our family. We haven't had any issues except the fact that in the last evening hot water disappeared on the first floor  but it wasn't a big deal. To sum up it was a good stay and we had a great week in Villa Regina. Response from Sofronios October 2019 Dear Zivile   Hello from Eos Villas.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

11996314,Ian September 2019 This villa has possibly one of the best pools and views of any place we've stayed in  we liked it so much we stayed there twice. The location is lovely  above Agni Bay  it has a large terrace around the pool but it is not as secluded as we like  as it is overlooked by a neighbouring property and the pool area is open to the road and can be seen from an adjacent access path  though neither are especially busy. The road to get there is quite narrow  winding and steep in places and the parking could feel very awkward for non-confident drivers. The house itself is comfortable and well-equipped but has a tricky layout  being on two separate levels with the largest bedroom in the annex by the pool. The kitchen and lounge are well designed  we personally found the style of the bathrooms and bedrooms a bit old-fashioned but everything worked well and we spent most of the time outside anyway. The management team were very responsive and acted quickly to address any problems we had.

11996314,Sylbert April 2019 We had a very lovely stay. The pictures don’t do this place justice. The highlights are the pool and the views from the property which are both outstanding. The bedrooms are a bit cozy and the layout is a bit awkward as one of the double bedrooms is separated from the rest of the house and has its own separate entrance. This didn’t bother us as we didn’t need a third bedroom. But the property is very well equipped and in excellent condition. Stefanos was really good with comms all the way through  the let was very professionally managed and our check in / out was pretty seamless. Would not hesitate to recommend. thanks guys for an excellent stay. Response from Sofronios May 2019 Dear Sylbert   Hello from Eos Villas.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.

11996314,Jane September 2018 Wonderful location overlooking Agni Bay with its 3 Tavernas and cocktail bar within an easy walk from Villa Regina  although you need a little fitness to walk back up the hill! We loved our week and walked to Kalami  the next Bay along regularly to top up supplies from one of their two private supermarkets and to enjoy their Tavernas for fresh orange juice  meals and beach/sea activities. We did our main shop at Aldi  on our way from the airport. We had noted from previous reviews that there were no basic essentials provided which we felt was a pity - having to purchase all essentials and then leave them assuming that the next guests will not benefit. Have asked that this be reviewed. We would love to return to this perfect location and comfortable Villa. Response from Sofronios September 2018 Dear Jane   Hello from Eos.

11996314,Doug May 2018 We have had a wonderful stay at Villa Regina  if anything the photos don’t it justice! The location is gorgeous  the very steep drive up to the villa is a bit nerve wracking but you get used to it  and it’s totally worth it for the incredible views. The local tavernas are all lovely  our favourite being Nikolas taverna for its great atmosphere and food. The nearest shop is about 1.5 miles away in the next bay  it’s well stocked with basics but we did a big shop in the Lidl at the airport to get stocked up. We hired a boat from Agni boats one day which is a must do  also had days out to Paleokastritsa and Corfu Town which we can highly recommend. The villa is spotlessly clean and having a housekeeper half way through the week was appreciated. It has plenty of amenities  it would have been handy to have a small amount of salt  pepper and oil but that’s a minor thing. The communication was quick and clear  we couldn’t be happier with that. The age range of our group was 11 to 67 and we have all loved the holiday  so much so that we will probably rebook for next year. We couldn’t get over the incredible pool and stunning view  we’ve all fallen in love with it and can’t wait to come back! Response from Sofronios June 2018 Dear Doug  Hello from Eos.

11996314,Michael August 2017 The villa is a very nice building with a super pool and a beautiful view. The prices are rather high for the service provided. The owner of the house  which showed up every second day  was very impolite and did not threaten us as welcoming guests. The agency should provide further services as a daily maid  pick-up and drop-off from the airport or a personal welcome with a walk-through the villa. Our stay was ok  but definitely not a good price-value-ratio.

11996314,Yigit September 2016 Fantastic experience in Villa Regina. The pictures in the listing look like a dream when you look at it. Don't doubt... The villa's view  swimming pool and its location are amazing.  Sofronios made everything self-serve and he was easily reachable. We were extremely satisfied with our stay and I'd highly recommend this villa if you are visiting Corfu. Response from Sofronios September 2016 Dear Yigit.

11996314,Alex May 2016 The photos don't really do the view from Villa Regina justice  they are breathtaking. The Villa itself is lovely. It has only recently been refurbished and was clean and well presented on arrival. We loved every minute of our stay here and didn't want to leave! The location is very remote so I would recommend a hire car to get around. Agni bay itself is lovely with three Taverna's to visit and boats to hire. Sofronios and the Eos team couldn't have been more helpful. They organised us a car  send comprehensive driving instructions beforehand and generally catered to our every need. We would love to come back again! Response from Sofronios May 2016 Dear Alex   Hello from Eos.  Many thanks for your holiday feedback.  I am delighted that your stay with us was enjoyable.

The pool and the view over the bay were amazing. There are also many ways to sit together. Since the upperand lower floors are not directly connected  you have to walk around the outside  but that is okay. The property is quietly located  so we recommend a rental car. The neighbor was also very friendly. Translated from German  Show original Response from Sofronios October 2018 Dear Janine   Good morning from Eos.

51213052,Carley November 2022 Angel’s house is a wonderful  cozy seaside cottage. We went during rainy season  and although many restaurants nearby were closed  we had all of the beaches and tourist sites to ourselves which was amazing! The rain was not too bad and there was plenty of sunshine every day too. Hearing the waves all day is such a treat. Highly recommend!
51213052,Andy October 2022 I would recommend staying at this property.
51213052,Liz September 2022 The most wonderful place in an amazing setting. We loved being the only people on the little beach  and having lunch on the terrace. The house is perfect! Sadly the taverna was not open but there are a couple of others nearby which were good. We cannot get over how kind and friendly the Greek people are. We would highly recommend a stay here.
51213052,Paula September 2022 We truly love this place! The view and the sound of the waves is amazing! The room is cozy and perfect for a couple. I have never stayed anywhere that was this close to the water. There are good restaurants nearby and all of the places we ate at were delicious. Next time we travel to Corfu  we will definitely stay longer! Thank you  Anastasia  for being such a great host!
51213052,Andrew September 2022 you have to stay here  the location is amazing  the studio perfect and the little touches left by the host are perfect!
51213052,Vincent September 2022 What an amazing location  right next to the sea. Waking up and having breakfast at the terrace is lovely. Good support from Anastasia also.  One thing that you need to take into account is that the AirBnB is next to the road  earplugs are recommended if you don’t like the noise of (sometimes) passing cars. Even though I rate this AirBnB 5 stars because everything makes up for that. Highly recommended place.  We also had a lot of tourists asking us if the place is for rent.
51213052,Sharon August 2022 Beautiful place  perfect location. So many little extras was given to us by Anastasia to make our stay perfect. My only wish was if we could have stayed longer!
51213052,Zuzana July 2022 Fully recommended great place for a couple or two friends you can’t go wrong
51213052,Harriet June 2022 Beautiful location  such a nice and quiet break. The restaurant across the road was stunning as well as all the other local restaurants we visited on our trip. The sound of the waves as you fall asleep is incomparable. Worth every penny!!
51213052,Trudi June 2022 Absolutely paradise !  The views are absolutely amazing  listening to the sound of the ocean from either laying on the bed inside or sat outside gave this particular property the edge over anything else we came across on this island.  Your literally steps away from snorkelling in the clearest of oceans.  The property is very well equipped and the host on hand if needed but also gives you complete privacy throughout your stay.  It’s everything the reviews say and more   comfy bed  great air conditioning  very clean  powerful shower and loads of outdoor space.  The restaurant directly across serves amazing food and excellent hospitality.  The host provides many little unexpected touches (so very kind and generous)  We highly highly recommend this place it’s an absolute gem!!!  Thank you so much Show more
51213052,Karen May 2022 To wake up in this lovely space and experience the sun rising on the Mediterranean Sea from your private terrace is only one of the specialness of Avaotaoia’s bungalow on the sea. Originally  It was Nikos’ master fisherman grandfathers's bungalow that they have visioned into a lovely cottage on the sea. A very thoughtful stay with all the necessities and more with special garden and added treats! I have stayed at many Airbnbs that do not go this distance- down to the soft sheets and cosy blankets  slippers and heat/air conditioning and view  view  view! The kindness  generosity and love in this sweet bungalow is felt from the first second you see the home. I traveled solo and felt safe and private and delighted to be in a more low key area. To walk right down the road by the sea was peace filled. There was tea and nespresso machine and great set up for cooking and eating on the huge terrace. I especially enjoyed sipping wine from the porch swing and lovely garden with olive trees over 100 years old. But why cook when you can go to the cousins George and Elena’s taverna right across the street for fabulous food and kind hospitality? I especially recommend visiting the traditional village Chlomos in the mountains   a UNESCO site. So many stories and treasures the kind people of Corfu share! You will fall in love with this host family  their sweet private bungalow home and this side of the island!!! Show more
51213052,Fabienne October 2021 All in all we had an amazing stay in Angel’s House! It was very clean and surprisingly we got some welcome gifts like croissants  one red house wine and so on. The terrace looked exactly as it was shown by the pictures on AirBnB. It was simply beautiful. The house itself was very clean and it had everything one could be asking for. Even though we got to say that we were really lucky with the weather  since the house itself is kind of small and we can imagine that if you can’t go outside because of rain  it wouldn’t have been such a wonderful vacation. Nikos was very kind and showed us everything at our arrival. The view and the garden lights were just another highlight of this little „Angel’s House“.
51213052,Nikita September 2021 The place is located right on the water. It feels private - if that’s what you’re looking for from a vacation home.  The owners are lovely people; constantly taking time out their day to ensure your comfort.  Right in front the house you’ll find an incredible authentic Greek restaurant.  This is definitely the spot to choose for your holiday. 10/10
51213052,David August 2021 Anastasia is the sweetest and best host you can ask for! Charmingly kind and super helpful in every way  we felt absolutely welcome from the beginning on and left with a big smile at the end. The place itself is magical- clean  spacious and quiet  beautifully equipped and designed to relax. Small surprises and a big  beautiful bunch of flowers for my girlfriends birthday made it a unforgettable experience - thanks so much  we will be back soon ❤️
51213052,Lahcen August 2022 Great stay  everything was perfect . The house is well equipped  it had everything you need and then some .

It's much nicer in person than in the pictures. Ohropax are recommended  as the house is directly adjacent to a road  but is not bad any more. Generally a place to stay highly recommended.

Had a great time at Angels House  will definitely come back! Translated from German  Show original
51213052,Christina August 2021 We had a great week in the small cottage by the sea. The location is unique and the view from the window in the morning is like a photo wallpaper.

2548093,Jane October 2022 These are fabulous apartments to stay in . The location is superb very beautiful and very quiet. The accommodation is well equipped and very clean. Nick and Anna are fabulous hosts. Nothing is too much trouble. We give 5* all round and will definitely be returning to Messongi
2548093,Antonia October 2022 Staying with Nick and Anna was just perfect. You have a fantastic view of the sea and in the cozy apartment you have everything you need for a relaxing beautiful holiday. The terrace is indescribably great  you wake up and see the beautiful ocean! The communication with Nick and Anna was great  they are the best hosts we have ever had - When my boyfriend had an accident  Nick drove us to the hospital and helped us with everything. His calm and kind demeanor put me at ease  I seriously didn't know what else we would have done without him.  All in all one can say that it couldn't be better and we recommend this gem to everyone without a doubt! We will be back definitely!
2548093,Nicola October 2022 We stayed for a week 2nd to 9th Oct in a ground floor  sea view studio. Everything was just perfect  fab location  great communication from Nick  studio was spotless with nice furnishings and the best sea views. we were lucky to have a week of perfect weather  Corfu is a beautiful Island and Messonghi provided a lovely relaxing week with great Tavernas and a few nice bars. lovely to meet you Nick  we will definitely stay again.
2548093,Holly October 2022 We had a great time at Galini Beach! The location right on the shore was brilliant and Nick and Anna were lovely hosts.
2548093,Catherine September 2022 We had a fantastic stay at Galini beach studios  the location and the apartment are beautiful  with the sea just on the doorstep. Nick and Anna are very kind and welcoming hosts. Communication was excellent and they responded to any queries immediately. As well as spending time relaxing on the terrace and swimming in the sea  we enjoyed exploring the surrounding area on foot  and eating out at the local tavernas. Thanks again Nick and Anna  we look forward to visiting again!
2548093,Laura September 2022 Amazing location and great accommodation  the sea is on your doorstep! Far enough away from the hubbub if you are looking for a quiet break  it’s a 5 minute walk into the village which has everything you need including some great bars and tavernas. Nick and Anna were fab hosts
2548093,Andreea Christina September 2022 Stunning stay. Close to everything you need. The fact that you have 10 steps to get into the sea is amazing. Very comfortable studio. Very good communication
2548093,Julia August 2022 Wow! We had such a great time at your apartment. Everything went just perfectly - from communication  to check in  corfu tips and check out. We enjoyed the view  the sea  the private area and most of all the sunrise every single morning. The kitchen had everything we needed for a great breakfast on our terrace and we even cooked at night because we loved hanging out with that beautiful view. Definitely one of our best Airbnb experiences :-) thanks!
2548093,Annabel August 2022 Great!
2548093,Heather July 2022 Anna & Nick are wonderful hosts and everything we asked about was respsonded to within 5/10 minutes. They gave us advice on tavernas  taxis and buses around the island and came to help us with the oven hob within minutes of my message. The location was amazing and everything you need is just down the road: the general market provided all the bits and bobs and all the traditional greek tavernas were minutes walk away. I’d recommend not going to the village centre for food as we personally found the best tavernas were outside the village and still only minutes walk away (Fisherman’s Haunt  George and Elena’s  Zak’s). We couldn’t fault our stay with Anna and Nick and couldn’t recommend them enough!
2548093,Gianfilippo July 2022 Literally a stone's throw from the sea! Woderful!!
2548093,Alana June 2022 What can I say…..this place is absolutely amazing! We stayed here for 5 nights and only wished we could have stayed for longer. The location is stunning. Our room was a sea view on the 1st floor  and we certainly weren’t disappointed! You only have to step out of the back door and you have your own private little area right on the beachfront. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The suit was spotless and had everything we needed. Situated a very short stroll away from the town centre  where you can find an array of beautiful little taverns to eat in. If I could give this a 10 star score I would! Anna and Nick were amazing hosts. We can’t wait to return!
2548093,Lily June 2022 Perfect apartment and location if you're wanting a chilled  relaxed holiday. Nick & Anna were very helpful and friendly  answered any questions quickly and arranged an airport transfer for us. The kitchenette is ideal for making your own meals as well as lots of food places nearby. I would recommend 75 steps (if you don't mind the walk - the view is worth it)  Romeo's (especially for the moussaka) and the gyros at Korali snack bar.
2548093,Salvatore May 2022 It was an Amazing staying  we really appreciate the apartment and the kindness of Anna and Nick who answer very soon at evey question you have. They recommend me also to rent a car really close the apartment with a discount for the guests . I ve just notice that If you would you like to spend the holiday in the northern beaches   this is not the place for you because the road in Corfu are not very comfortable. ( around 1.30 h)
2548093,Hannah May 2022 Perfect room  perfect location  perfect host - We are definitely coming back. If you want to go to Messongi  you should book your Galini Beach Studio ! :-)  Galini Beach Studios are such a nice  peaceful place. We rented a scooter and visited many places in Korfu but were always looking forward to return to the Appartement. Spent hours on the terrace.  Also Messonghi is a very cute village  nice restaurants  supermarket.. everything you need.
2548093,Lincoln May 2022 Nick is one of if not the best host I have ever had. The view was perfect  everything was comfortable and Nick was BY FAR the most helpful host I have ever had. Just an unbelievable trip and Nick and his room made it a perfect 10/10 trip.
2548093,Mollie May 2022 Absolutely fantastic place to stay  the pictures don’t do it justice! Incredible location and such an experience to stay so close to the sea. The terrace is a fantastic addition and a great way to spend a relaxing day. Nick and Anna are the bests hosts and we couldn’t have asked for anything more! Perfect place to stay!
2548093,Madeleine May 2022 A perfect gem of a place to stay in a beautiful on the beach location. Quiet  but with local shops  bars and restaurants minutes walk away. Room was excellent with lovely en suite  self catering facilities (although we loved eating out) and views to die for. The pleasure of stepping from your bedroom to your own private patio for breakfast then a few steps more to beach is very rare and special. Attentive hosts who were just a few minutes away if we needed anything. We'll be back asap!
2548093,Wendy October 2021 Nick and Anna are excellent hosts  their quick responses and helpfulness prior to our visit was really appreciated during these challenging times. Thank you Both.
2548093,Julian October 2021 Absolutely perfect. Apartment directly at the beach with a private beach and lots of chill option (hammocks  etc.). Nick is a lovely  carrying host and we would definitely come back.
2548093,Kelvin September 2021 Wow wow wow… where do I start….  This place is a little paradise set within its own private terrace which leads onto the beach.  The rooms are spotless and very modern with amazing views of the sea.  Anna and Nick are such lovely people. They could not have been more helpful and really went out of their way to name sure we had a great holiday.  We hired a car for the week and parked two houses away in Anna’s Mam and dads (who are also really friendly and her dad is so funny and made us laugh every time we seen him)  Honestly don’t look any further if you want accommodation in this area…. It’s top class 👍👍 Show more
2548093,Lucie September 2021 Comfy apartment with very beautiful sea view. Great communication with Anna and Nick. Highly reccomended.
2548093,Jule August 2021 We had a wonderful stay! Everything was perfect (the apartment  communication and of course messonghi!). We had a little problem with the tap in the bathroom  but Nick helped us immediately in the middle of the night. I highly recommend the studios for your stay  the town is great (not too many tourists and really nice restaurants) there is a bus line to corfu-town and the messonghi is well located to reach other spots on the island (maybe you should hire a car for 2-3 days to see the best ones!) Thanks for everything  we will come back! :-)
2548093,Lukas August 2021 We had such a great time staying in the Galini Beach Studios. The apartment was in a good location: more than close to the sea + restaurants & super markets near by but over all not to busy and touristy. Nick and Anna were amazing hosts - super friendly and helpful with everything we asked for. We will surely come back! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2548093,Marco August 2021 Everything was perfect. At anytime again!
2548093,Ella July 2021 We’ve just returned from our 10 day stay at Galini. Perfection is the only way to describe it!  From the moment we booked Nick and Anna made us feel so welcome! They organised our transfers and provided all the information on the area we could need. We even had assistance booking our COVID tests  the process was very easy and not stressful at all.  Our room ( Ground floor sea view) was perfect. Very well appointed and it had everything we needed. We feel so lucky to have found this gem of a place!! Our expectations were completely blown out of the water. You are literally steps away from the crystal clear sea  relaxation is completely guaranteed here.  We can’t wait to return to our new favourite place in the world.  Nick and Anna  we can’t thank you enough. Show more
2548093,Stuart October 2019 My stay at Galini was excellent - The place was not only clean and well kept  but also in an excellent position near/on the beach (depending on tide!) and on the sea front. Nick was extremely accommodating and the place is regularly cleaned (4 times a week or so) with new towels and the bed made up. Also  it is really easy to get to and from the airport (Lord Travel/Holiday Taxis do pre-arranged 45 mins bus travel to a bus stop 5 minute walk away) and near shops (a small supermarket is near the bus stop) and some nice restaurants (I recommend the one on the corner near Aquarius Hotel/bus stop called Village Taverna Marilena). All in all I can't recommend Galini enough and I would stay there again if I visit Corfu again (likely).
2548093,Michele August 2019 Great location  great room  great communication  even better than the pictures. Lovely small resort. Would recommend with no hesitation.
2548093,Shannon April 2019 Having a seaside view from your window and a place to lay in the sun at your immediate doorstep makes this place exceptional. Great value for money. The town nearby is quaint and has access to the basics with nice taverna's down the way. Nick and Anna were generous enough to upgrade us to a larger suite and were both there to show us to our room upon arrival. Response time was exceptionally fast and we always felt well taken care of. Wouldn't hesitate to come back.
2548093,Gal April 2019 Amazing place on the water. Great host!
2548093,Mārtiņš October 2017 Location is very good. The best restaurant i just 5 min walk away by seaside. If you prefer to read a book there is the best view for it on terrece.
2548093,Steve June 2016 My wife & I stayed in one of the first-floor sea view studios for a week – and I can honestly say it was probably the best studio-type accommodation we have ever stayed in - and we have been to various Greek islands several times in the past. I had been inclined not to give a rave review because we want to keep this little gem to ourselves but it just has to be shared – it’s that good! As many reviewers have said  the pictures are entirely accurate but don't do it full justice – it is in a really great location – right on the beach. Nothing could beat getting up with the sunrise and walking downstairs  across the terrace area and diving straight into the water for a swim. Snorkelling is also great and there are plenty of different fish to see even in relatively shallow water. It is quiet and peaceful  yet only a short stroll into the village with a full range of shops and there are bars and tavernas  many of them on the beach and with excellent views. There is a quiet bar / restaurant right next door to the studios if you’re feeling lazy and there are also several restaurants within easy walking distance outside of the village if you fancy exploring. The room was really well equipped and had everything you would need for self-catering – and we often had breakfast and the occasional lunch there. The interiors are well-designed and the furnishings and fittings were all excellent. The room itself and all the other areas around were spotless and cleaned regularly The bedlinen and towels were also changed frequently. We were going to hire a car to explore the southern and south-western part of the island that we haven’t been to before and then we were going to hire a speedboat for half a day to find some deserted coves and beaches – but you know what  we pretty much stayed put – it’s such a great  relaxing place to be – and we really enjoyed our stay there. Nick and Ana were excellent hosts – nothing was too much trouble and no query went unanswered. When the sad time came for us to leave  they even booked a taxi back to the airport for us. We can’t praise them highly enough for such well thought out  excellent accommodation and for being so helpful  approachable and friendly. Many  many thanks – we’ll definitely be back! Show more
2548093,Antonia April 2015 We had a fantastic week in Corfu. Staying in the sea view studio (ground floor) was a perfect decision - we loved to have breakfast on the terrace just 20 meters away from the sea! Everything was perfect.
2548093,Silvia October 2022 A little paradise. Anna and Nick's apartment is just as you can see in the photos  on the contrary  even better  more spacious and comfortable in our case. Perfect for a quiet and romantic vacation. Nice restaurants and a small market are within walking distance. The sea in front of the house is transparent and wonderful with nothing to envy to other beaches on the island  although bigger and more popular. September is an ideal time  even if it's a bit risky. We weren't very lucky because of persistent clouds and some rain. Recommended. But move ahead because it's always sold out! Translated from Italian  Show original

1210550,Rickie-Lee September 2022 Amazing. We will be back. Not much more to say. It was so perfect! Clean and quiet and beautiful. You hear the waves from everywhere! The restaurant closest is the best with melt in your mouth octopus. At the other end there is a Play ground and pool for kids close by too. Family of 3 with a 2year old. The safety  security and privacy the hedge provided is amazing. We could kick a ball and relax not worried about anyone escaping  jumping or throwing things off anything. Wonderful and 0 complaints. Exactly like in the pictures.
1210550,Sandra September 2022 We had a lovely stay at the accommodation. It is perfectly located near the beach with a lovely yard and privacy. We didn’t miss a thing  the apartment was very good equipped. Thank you Victor!
1210550,Amanda June 2022 We had a wonderful stay at Victor’s apartment with our two children (18 mo & 3yrs). The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed  and a cot & high chair & beach towers were all provided.  For us  having the garden was a huge plus and meant we could still sit out whilst the kids were asleep/napping. It also meant they had plenty of roots to run around when we weren’t at the beach.  The best bit however was it’s location  right on the beach and a few minutes walk to a couple of tavernas and mini market. If your after nightlife this isn’t your place but I would definitely recommend to any families with young kids.
1210550,Donnacha June 2022 Helpful and responsive. A great seaside location.
1210550,Isabelle May 2022 Stunning location just at the beach. Little cute house with everything you need… Excellent! We will come again….!!!
1210550,Ashni September 2021 Had a lovely stay. The apartment is in the perfect location  a stone throw away from the sandy beach and is well equipped for cooking.
1210550,Hubert August 2021 A great house in a very special location with a fantastic view over the sea!
1210550,Mylene August 2021 Well equipped  fantastic location  and beautiful view!!
1210550,Sergey July 2021 Small but cozy home in the best location in Glyfada. The perfect place to relax while gazing at the sea or the stars. A couple of steps to the beach. The best local restaurant is also nearby. The villa is located a little away from the crowded part of the village. Thus  you get an almost private beach  peace and privacy. To live in Glyfada and travel around the island  you will need a car. This village is ia little difficult to access due to the winding mountain road. But this is a great place for a relaxing stay. And Victor is a very responsive host. Would definitely recommend the villa for a stay.
1210550,Eric October 2020 Glyfada beach is a great place to stay. The beach is and the green cliff backdrop is amazing. Unfortunately we had pretty mediocre weather for late September. Victor is a very attentive and nice host. He is not around but answers all questions immediately. The place is pretty small but perfect because it’s directly at the beach. It’s amazing to wake up and fall asleep with nothing but the ocean. Make sure you store your precious stuff in the safe. We were missing two rings after our first days. Someone must have sneaked in secretly without us noticing. But I don’t blame neither Victor nor the cleaning staff. They were all extremely trustworthy. All in all I can really recommend the beach and Victors house. And we surely will come back. Response from Victor October 2020 Dear Eric  Thanks for your email and feedback. I am sorry to hear again about this incident you are mentioning however no one has sneaked in the house secretly as you are saying  We are renting this villa for the last 10 years and we never had an issue like this. Our staff is trustful as you are mentioning and the lost of the 2 rings that you are saying happened before any person came to clean the house.  And let me add the following points:  -You have asked as for the key of the safe that you have received from the begining of your stay ( don t understand why you did not put them in the safe).  - I have offered you to call the police for the incident that you are mentioning but you have refused.  - And there is no trace of any offence in the house. The house is exactly as you you have received it.  I stay at your disposal for more information you might need  Best regards  Victor Show more
1210550,Paul August 2020 The villa is perfect for a family holiday on one of Corfu’s finest beaches. A well equipped kitchen made self catering easy. Lovely light  clean space right on the beach.
1210550,Diana June 2019 Don’t miss this outstanding place for your vacation with beloved ones! With our two girls we adored the place  the view on the sea  the sea sounds and the great conditions in the house. We will return!
1210550,Alexey June 2018 This is a great place for a family vacation. The house is not big but everything is at hand. Beautiful view and near the magic beach.
1210550,Alexey June 2018 This is a great place for a family vacation. The house is not big but everything is at hand. Beautiful view and near the magic beach.
1210550,Selini & Joram June 2018 We are a family of 4 with 2 small children. We absolutely loved the house. The styling is great and the house comfortable. There were some toys available. The location is the best and convenient. Glyfada is beautiful. The 4 restaurants are good. We had fun at the beach bar Pazazu (great food) and loved the view at the Glyfada restaurant. The 2 mini markets are pricy but supermarkets are near. Nearby beach Pelekas (Kontogialos) also has great bars and restaurants. For us it was the most perfect holiday. We would really recommend it for families and also couples or friends. Thanks Victor!
1210550,Susanne April 2018 We spent a great time at Victor's house. The location and the view to the beach was wonderful.
1210550,Adi August 2017 המקום בדיוק כמו שבתמונות. נקי ומתוחזק היטב. אבזור מלא. נמצא על אחד החופים היפים בקורפו.. למי שמתכנן להישאר בעיקר במקום אחד זה מקום מושלם
1210550,Elena August 2017 The apartment was clean and as we arrived there was everything we needed (water  tea  coffee  soap). The cleaners came every other day  changing the towels as well. The Kitchen was vey well equipment and the the apartment was located right on the beach with a beautiful and very picturesque view. The location was perfect for exploring the island  also it was next to Pazuzu( a famous beach bar/restaurant)  and Pelekas village(10 minutes with the car) with really nice restaurants. Response from Victor August 2017 Thanks Elena  And hope to see you next year
1210550,Galina June 2017 The villa is as described. Amasing view and garden. Cool at night. Always shadow at the terrace. All needed is provided. The owner is very nice and helpful. Although he lives in Athens he provides assistance. He even left botteled watter in case we arrive too late to buy some. I have only one remark. Victor is not the owner bit arranges renting the place via airbnb. Communication with him was easy Response from Victor June 2017 Dear Galina   Thanks for your nice message. A small clarification. I am the owner of the house. The person you have spoken in Athens is my father Marios Camhis who is also the onwer of the house with me  Have a nice day  Victor Camhis Show more
1210550,Anastasia September 2016 Victor is a great host  contacting us with instructions and suggestions prior to arrival. There was everything in the bungalo we needed when we arrived: water  tea  coffee  soap  detergent  a much needed first aid kit. The kitchen is very well equipped with nice china  new appliances  pots and pans and very sharp knives. The children were happy to discover toys and a bag full of beach toys. Wifi glitches were sorted promptly  Victor got back to us straight away. The cleaners have missed their first visit but came every other day after that. The bungalow is located right on the beach in a secure compound. The area is beautiful and very picturesque  but lacked restaurant options and the beach wasn't the cleanest we've seen. Location was perfect for exploring the island.
1210550,Antonina September 2022 We had a very nice stay at Victor's house! The property is very well equipped  the terrace is great for breakfast  sunbathing and staying. We would definitely want to come again:-) Translated from German  Show original
1210550,Fernando August 2022 Great stay at the place. Clean  quiet and with unbeatable views. The garden is watered at night and is very well kept. 100% recommended for a few days off Translated from Spanish  Show original

1210550,Biju October 2018 If you prefer a relaxing beach vacation in an apartment/bungalow to a hotel complex  Victor's accommodation is excellently accommodated. Even if the apartment is not particularly large  it is always sufficient for 4 people. The service takes place twice a week. The apartment is cleaned  the towels are changed and all necessary things such as soap etc. are filled if necessary. Within the apartment there is a table in the open plan kitchen-living area with 3 chairs and a couch. On the covered veranda there is a dining table for 6 people as well as several beach loungers  an umbrella for the beach as well as play equipment such as children's shovels and bins for the beach but also a beach ball set  etc. Even a football gate was available to assemble. In front of the terrace is a garden whose hedge borders directly on the beach. This gives you a wonderful view of the sea yourself and is protected from views from the outside. In the immediate vicinity are shopping and dining options such as a mini market  restaurants or a beach bar. Not far within 4 km there are excellent taverns with very good food for children as well as adults. The apartment also has a kitchen including all the necessary utensils that self-catering guests will not miss. The information provided by Victor is extensive. We recommend a rental car  as this clearly facilitates the accessibility of the taverns in the surrounding area as well as excursions to the sights or another beach. We can fully recommend the place. It should be taken into account that it is not accessible. We stayed there for 10 days during the autumn holidays at the beginning of October and had very good weather except for one morning and an afternoon. Swimming in the sea was easily possible with the children even after sunset  as you are quickly back in the house due to the proximity to the beach. The apartment has a private outdoor shower  so a quick shower after the sea water is always and quickly possible. It should be noted that the waves are quite strong  so surfers will also get their money's worth and we had a lot of fun in the waves. Show more Translated from German  Show original

1210550,Mehran September 2017 It was a very nice relaxing vacation right on Glyfada beach. Place was very good. Viktor had previously explained everything in a detailed guide with tips. The house is very well equipped and you have everything you need. Sparkling water was already provided for our late arrival (02:00)  which was great. Shopping is possible nearby. The terrace and the small garden are very well maintained and you have a beautiful view of the sea. The beach practically at your feet. In the first days Glyfada beach was very restless with high waves (beginning of Sep.)  which I personally like  but also with rain and storm (1 day) the landscape is a delight. In the last few days the water was calm and the sea wonderful for snorkeling. There are also reasonable restaurants right on the beach nearby. The mountain village of Pelekas can be reached by car in 10 minutes  we were there 3-4 times  highly recommended. Kerkyra 1/2 hour  a great city. Overall very relaxing  quiet and stress-free. We will be happy to come back! Translated from German  Show original
24365804,Andrea October 2022 We had a great time in Pelekas. The house has an excellent location almost directly on the beach  and the view is beautiful. The house is basic but has all you need!
24365804,Reinhard September 2022 We had a fantastic stay in Corfu and the house was perfect for what we had been looking for. The photos really do not do the location justice  the apartment is so close to a sandy beach and had a nice  quiet restaurant close by. There is great parking (hire car definitely recommended) and the whole check-in process was very easy. Mixalis were very easy to contact and kept in touch throughout the stay. This really is a rare find!
24365804,Martin August 2022 This is a nice house close to some restaurants/ bars and the beach. We had a few smaller things that needed attention  but were quickly solved by Dimitris (thanks a lot!). You will need a car to reach the place and also to travel around as you might want some variation from the local beach. We were there in high season which comes with a big number of daily visitors and traffic on the small road right next to the house.
24365804,Elena July 2022 Nice house and awesome view. Helpful and kind hosts .
43821880,Aicha November 2022 wow best host ever🧡 it was wonderful- and we felt like family with nina and her family! what lovely people! thanks thanks- full of love... and the house was super cozy and good energy to relax and rest... fcherista for everything... inchallah we will see you again... love and light to you🙏🏽🦋🙏🏽🧡
43821880,Marenka October 2022 Nina's house is a cozy gem in one of the most beautiful areas of Corfu. Surrounded by ancient olive trees and quiet beaches  there is almost no traffic on the nearby road. In the kitchen  bathroom and bedroom you will find everything you need to feel good. Nina is an enchanting host  she took care of us with lots of good advice and fulfilled the few wishes that were still open (print out boarding passes). We would come back anytime  thank you for your hospitality dear Nina!
43821880,Eran September 2022 We had a great time and Nina was very helpful and answered any question that we had. The house is nicely located to give you the atmosphere of the olive groves and you can hear the sea. The village catered for most of our needs. We recommend a narrow car to navigate the alleys and roads.
43821880,Rene September 2022 This is the cleanest and best equipped place I have ever been to and I highly recommend staying here. Nina is a great host  extremely nice  and very responsive to all questions and needs. She provides great recommendations and will do anything for you to have a great time. The location is quite and wonderful; the house is so super clean and it has anything you need. You will not regret staying here!
43821880,Russell June 2022 Nina was a generous and delightful host. She was attentive to all of our needs and offered helpful suggestions for things to do and see while in Corfu. The kitchen was well stocked with breakfast items and the apartment was incredibly clean. The views and garden are stunning and the location is very quiet and peaceful. Nina had so many personal touches waiting for us upon our arrival. She went above and beyond to make sure we had a lovely time. We can’t wait to come back again.
43821880,Anton June 2022 A truly amazing place with wonderfull host. Corfu is a must see and so is the place of Nina. There is nothing one will miss in her beautiful traditional house.
43821880,Kaia May 2022 We loved this place - the house was cozy  very well decorated  clean. When we arrived  we had some welcome-gift  that was very heart warming. Nina also had bought us some groceries that we could make us breakfast next morning. This all made us feel like home. There were coffe and tea available  and also some oil  spices - we didn't have to buy them extra. Nina was always reachable by WhatsUp. Our daughter left her airpods there  so Nina posted them by mail. So  overall  we loved our vacation there and we felt like home  didn't want to leave at all.
43821880,Emma April 2022 Off the beaten track in a real Greek fishing village - a little way out of the village along a quiet country lane you will find this perfect Airbnb house and amazing garden. Nina and her family are loving  generous and authentic  if you wish to get a taste of real life Corfiot life  then this is a place you want to stay. We had no car  so used the bikes provided to get around and the local bus service- walking to town for lunch at the brilliant tavernas - Angela’s and Chris ‘Sofias’  and the short trek through olive groves to the sandy  sheltered fishing cove for a swim. The local people were also so kind and welcoming  giving us oranges  chocolate and treats every visit  getting my son to help out with painting a seascape and giving him Easter decorations  even delivering our shopping for us - their generosity was touching. Nina’s house is spotlessly clean  modern  despite the historic fabric  and has absolutely everything you might need for a comfortable stay; if not Nina does everything to make sure she can get what you need. I can not recommend highly enough. A very special mention to Nina’s Dad  Alexandro who can provide the freshest fish and the very best local wine  as well as telling a good story. Thank you Nina! 😘
43821880,Dirk April 2022 Cute little cottage in a very scenic mountain area. Nice garden  very friendly host. Thanks  Nina!
43821880,Sophie April 2022 One of the best Airbnbs I have stayed in.  The flat is very lovingly decorated with attention to detail. You will find everything you need and even more. The most extensive equipment I have ever experienced in an Airbnb.  The flat has a beautiful garden with a barbecue place and seating. The view is very beautiful. The surroundings are quiet and pleasant. Lots of nature.  There are beautiful olive groves nearby and a path to a quiet bay and an old harbour with a few fishing boats. The flat is a good starting point for day trips  although a rental car is recommended. Nina also provided bikes for us.  The communication was excellent. Nina was always available and took good care of us. We will definitely come back! :-)
43821880,Johanneke October 2021 Our stay at Mantzaros Country House was amazing and with Nina as our host it was even better! We (3 friends) arrived at Mantzaros after a long journey. Nina welcomed us with a tour through the house and the amazing big garden. The house is located on a quiet road. The garden is located on the other side of the road and has a sea view. A car is necessery and the roads might be challenging. The house is nicely decorated  clean and fully equiped. Everything you can think of is present. Nina gave us a lot of tips also provided breakfast for the first morning. During our stay we could always ask Nina for tips and information about the area or recommendations for places to eat. We highly recommend this place!!!
43821880,Andres September 2021 The place is beautiful  the host is a wonderful and attentive person  the location is extremely quiet and very nice; the Airbnb is comfortable and extremely clean  super well equipped. If you are searching for a very quiet place and vacation this is for you. You need a car if you want to see the rest of Corfu.
43821880,Tomasz September 2021 Mantzaros Country House is located in a beautiful place outside of the Pentati village. The house is really cosy and it has everything one needs. Nina and her family were always there to help us if we would need anything. They would bring us homemade wine  homegrown vegetables and fresh fish! We grilled the fish in a private olive tree garden next to the house and it was the best meal during our whole stay in the Corfu island. 😋  We stayed 11 days in Mantzaros Country House and we wished we could stay longer. It's an ideal place to spend time with your friends or family and fully enjoy Corfiot life!
43821880,Alis August 2021 Nina was really the kindest and nicest host ever. The house was clean and you have everything you need (even insect repellant sprays and different creams). Even though our stay was short  we felt her warmth and kindness. Her recomandations were also great  especially the tavernas from Pentati (Angela’s Taverna). Thank you for everything Nina 🤗
43821880,Sébastien August 2021 Mantzaros house is a fantastic place and Nina is definitely the best host you can imagine. We have spend an amazing week at Mantzaros house with a lot of splendid beaches close from the house (special mention to the sunset swimming at Agiou Nikolaou   a few hundred meter south to Paramonas). The house is perfectly clean  with everything you need (and more) and Nina was always very responsive to give us all the tips and information I was asking for. Also the 2 taverns in Pentati (2 km from the house) are among the best food experience in Corfu. Sofia's Chris Place with an amazing view and excellent food and Angela's with a unique kindest family cooking traditional Greek meals (unfortunately discovered only the last night...) Mantzaros house was clearly a fantastic experience for us and I recommend it warmly to everyone staying I Corfu.
43821880,Johannes August 2021 We spent two fantastic weeks at Nina's house. She and her family are really lovely people  who made a huge effort to make our stay as great as possible. Any request was answered immediately. Additionally we got useful tips from her  as a local  for locations  restaurants and beaches. Best of all: Local fish and scampi from Alexandros  Nina's father  including a delicious recipe how to cook scampi properly. Best host we ever had!
43821880,Jakub July 2021 We came as guests and left as friends! For is it was a perfect spot  with a perfect view  with all that you need in the house  with nice and informative conversations and some other extras we have not even expected. It is a 5 star review - wholeheartedly.  For others: you need a car - there's a place to park it. And you need to be prepared for some narrow and steep roads in the area. It is such a beautiful part of the island...
43821880,Serhii June 2021 Very cozy and quiet place. Nina is a great host in every way. She really cares about making you feel welcome and making sure that you have everything you need while here. The apartment is clean and stylish. WiFi was slow. Response from Nina June 2021 A very polite happy and extra friendly group of people that stayed at my house and made me feel very comfortable! My house is open to them anytime in future!
43821880,Anna Elisabeth June 2021 The Lovely Little House with The wonderful Garden is a good Place   when you like it quiet and to be far way from Tourists. Nina and her family is specially friendly and would like to fulfill every wish. The house inside is lovely decorated. It’s a very good stay. Response from Nina June 2021 Anna her husband and the kids   an amazing family ! Special guests  very friendly and polite we had a veey good communication ! I would be happy to host them again !
43821880,"Mona November 2020 Dear Nina  You are such a friendly and courteous hostess! We thank you for everything! We had a great time  even with Corona  because you made it so uncomplicated. We just wanted to say ""THANK YOU"" for....: ... our sweet home ... the wine  the olives the fantastic fish and olive oil ... the personal workman with the super glue :)  You are invited to Germany whenever you want! Thank you that we meet each other   we wish you and your family all the best! Stay safe! Katharina and Mona"
43821880,Britta September 2020 The place is absolutly perfect for a wonderful holiday. The house is one of the best equipped locations we ever had. Really nothing is missing: coffee  milk  honey  oil  wine from her father and so on. Besides the house and the garden are really well decorated. Nina is a very special host. She gave us a lot of tipps for the area: beautiful beaches  hiking trails or other places of interest. Thanks for these! Our holiday in your home was more then perfect. We can highly recommend this amazing place.
43821880,Claudia September 2020 We spent two weeks in Corfu and we absolutely loved this place! Nina and her family were outstanding hosts and made us feel at home  spoiling us with homemade wine  fresh fish and vegetables and filling up the fridge with basics for us. My husband and I were traveling with our baby girl and we were provided with a crib  a high chair and a lot of lovely amenities. There were even beach toys and a swimming ring waiting for her (which she totally enjoyed)!  The house is located close to the village of Pentati (where there's two tavernas with delicious Greek food and a supermarket) and 15 min. walking from the Vagionaki harbour. Paramonas beach is also a 5 min. drive away and it's perfect for children  with very little waves and shallow waters. You will need a car to move around and the roads are very narrow but that didn't bother us. People are extremely friendly and we felt like a part of the village by the end of our stay.  The kitchen was well equipped for cooking  everything was really clean and there's a grill in the garden  which we put to good use. I would highly recommend this place for families! :-) Show more
43821880,Anette August 2020 Very very nice house! Nina is an extraordinary host! They staying was more then perfect. I can strongly recommend this place.
43821880,Juraj August 2020 Nina's place is a great choice for explorers and people who want to experience authentic Corfu. It is situated near dramatic cliffs with picturesque views. The sea/mountain scenery is just amazing. The nearby village of Pentati is as authentic as it gets with one minimarket and two tavernas that offer traditional Corfiot cuisine. However  I recommend renting a car or quad  because both the village and Nina's house are quite remote in the hills.  In the house (which is by the way beutifully decorated and carefully renovated) you can find everything you need for a comfortable holiday (all necessary kitchen equipment  washing machine  microwave  toaster  towels  shower gel  shampoo  umbrellas for the beach  barbeque equipment  etc.). There is also a ceiling fan in each room. The whole place was crystal clean!  We arrived at midnight and Nina was waiting for us with a bottle of local wine and left some snacks and water in the fridge which was very kind of her. Nina is a caring host. She gave us great tips for beaches or hiking and brought a bottle of sweet white wine several times. Her father runs a fish shop  so we bought almost one kilo of prawns  a big fish  and a large squid for a very good price (around 40€). The barbeque in the garden during a hot summer night was just amazing!!!  To sum up  I highly recommend Nina's place. You will experience an unforgettable holiday in Corfu. Show more
43821880,Julien August 2020 Nina was a wonderfull host. We arrive late and she wait for us. During all the preparation of our trip she help us and she was always here for any question. She gives some good tips. The house is very confortable and well decorated. She offers us some wine for welcoming  and there was everything in the flat for cooking even rice or honey. The outsize is very beautiful with a giant garden included barbecue. We feel like home. I recommand obviously this house. Julien
43821880,Helene November 2022 Nina is a golden host! She is very welcoming  accommodating with the schedules of our plane  available at all times in complete discretion  and very good tips for starting our stay. The house is a small paradise  close to several breathtaking beaches. The place is strategic for visiting several parts of the island. The accommodation is impeccably clean  over-equipped  very pleasant. A big thank you to Nina!! Translated from French  Show original
43821880,"Marek September 2022 Above all  a sparkling-clean home  a well-crafted space in the details  and everything on hand. If something is missing or incomplete  Nina is here to help. You can order fresh fish  shrimp  and a barbecue in the cherry. Great place to walk  walk to the beach  or even the closest beach. There are great restaurants nearby. On the other hand  I encourage you to rent a car and then it's ok to visit every corner of the island even if it's back to the city of Corfu to discover ""old town."" Enjoy your stay.

43821880,Maaike July 2022 We enjoyed our stay at Nina's place very much. Everything is available for a family of 4. All possible cooking utensils  washing machine  hairdryer and even snorkels. The garden is fantastic and it was very nice that we were allowed to use the tomatoes from the garden for our own prepared Greek salads. The house is in a quiet location. There is a street between the house and the garden  but there is not much traffic. The nearest beach is about a 20-minute walk  but we usually took the car to a beach further - a few minutes' drive away (no problem to park). In the village there are three tasty affordable restaurants and a mini shop. The communication went very smoothly and Nina gave us tips and helped us to arrange a doctor's visit. Nina's papa- who came to water the plants was also very friendly. In short: highly recommended for those who like to stay in a quiet place of Corfu! Translated from Dutch  Show original
43821880,Kathrin July 2022 We were allowed to spend 2 wonderful weeks in this special place. Nina and her family are such lovely hosts that we will remember them for a long time. The colorful house with its lovingly designed garden is very well equipped and really offers everything you need. It stays pleasantly cool even on hot days/ nights. It is equipped with fly screens all around  so you never have to go mosquito hunting. The cooling stone terrace with the colorful flowers invites you to linger. Less than 5 minutes from the house is a fantastic small bay. It is not visible from the street  so you always have it to yourself. The peaceful town of Pentati also beckons with its lovely villagers  a well-equipped mini market and the STROFI  a great tavern with excellent traditional cuisine. Here you meet  large  small   here  village life plays out and as a guest you are always welcomed as if you were part of it. If you are looking for a beautiful  quiet and original place and would like to be enchanted by the Greek hospitality and warmth  you should definitely vacation here. Translated from German  Show original
43821880,Natacha July 2022 Very attentive  accommodating host who gives plenty of information. It's lovely. The house is clean and well decorated. The street between the house and the garden is very quiet. The area is quiet. Only small downside  we had beautiful weather in early July and the house gets sun and heats up quickly. The cottage  smaller  behind it has this advantage. Translated from French  Show original
43821880,Tobias June 2022 Greece is known for its hospitality  and we have been able to confirm this several times in recent years. But Nina and her family exceed this experience. They always go out of their way to make you feel like you're vacationing with friends. The apartment is very clean and lovingly furnished  everything seems very new. The place is very suitable to quickly reach the important sights of the island from a quiet home. Thanks to its western location  there is always a refreshing breeze  at least in early summer. We made some beautiful hikes in the adjacent mountain/ hills in the 12 days and visited many idyllic swimming beaches and - booked. Translated from German  Show original
43821880,Andrea May 2022 Everything was great! We had a lovely time in Nina's house! Translated from German  Show original
43821880,Steffi May 2022 Very nice clean apartment with good beds  well-equipped kitchen and large new bathroom  terrace in front of the house and large garden with barbecue. The house is located on the small  very little busy road between Pentati and Halikounas. The proximity to the street is not a problem at all. Every day the baker passes by and sells fresh cheap delicious bread. Luckily  you'll also catch the fisherman. We walked from the house to Pentati in the tavern and on the 'Hausberg'. Nina is a very likeable warm and helpful hostess. Translated from German  Show original
43821880,Vincent October 2021 The place is really great  both for the natural setting  the house  the hospitality. After a tiring trip  we were happy to have such a welcome and breakfast the next day. Nina is there and it's very nice  especially since the place seemed a little remote to us  with a not easy road to access it Translated from French  Show original
43821880,Anne August 2021 We had three dream days at Nina's house. The house is beautiful  very clean and extremely well equipped ! And the garden with its centuries-old olive trees! It's just beautiful. Nina is a lovely person  attentive to others and who answered all our questions and questions. She gave us plenty of insider tips on places to visit  secluded beaches and restaurants  to follow without so much as a second thought ! You can go there without so much as a second thought ! Translated from French  Show original
43821880,Stephanie July 2021 a warm welcome from Nina despite a very late arrival. There is everything you need for a great stay ... a very good place not to be missed in Corfu. Translated from French  Show original
43821880,Laura July 2021 Nina has thought and created everything to make you feel comfortable and welcome in Pentati. as small as a nickname  even if it was a picture of it  even if it was a beautiful moment. helps with suggestions to see and enjoy. 100% cleanliness  place  quiet are perfect. Translated from Latvian  Show original
43821880,Marie July 2021 Very good stay at Nina's. Super welcome at 1 a.m.! The small beach nearby is a real pool...Nina tells us plenty of places to discover  she is always smiling. We just found the beds a little too hard...but that's okay  we took naps in the hammock;) thank you so much for the stay. Translated from French  Show original Response from Nina July 2021 Wonderful family. I am lucky to have hosted them. They are all very kind. They left the house very clean..
43821880,Petra September 2020 It was great. I would highly recommend it 🙂 Translated from Czech  Show original
50700967,Dylan September 2022 WOW! Undoubtedly the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! Debbie was the most gracious host  she brought us homemade wine and gave us great recommendations on how to see Corfu like a local. The property itself was so unique with great outdoor spaces and beautiful olive trees. The cabin had electricity and a full bathroom with a shower. There was a big open balcony that overlooks the coast. This is glamping at its finest  but be aware you are in nature. We loved that aspect  but mosquitoes will share the space with you - that being said Debbie does a great job giving you all the necessary tools to fight them and they weren’t much of a bother. This place is a MUST STAY. In itself enough reason to visit Corfu. We can’t wait to go back!
50700967,Niels September 2022 Fantastic experience highly recommended if you are up to an outdoor setting
50700967,Ewa August 2022 Debie is just an Amazing host. She had fab idea making this place and she put all her heart in it. You couldn't ask for a better host! Location is great. Choosing her place is unforgettable experience. There is only one small thing: mosquitoes but Debie will do everything she can to stop them bothering you 😉
50700967,Janine July 2022 We had the absolute best time in our little cabin. The view is amazing and so are the hosts. We can really recommend staying with lovely Debbie!
50700967,Michael July 2022 Debbie was great! She gave us a lot of recommendations and had a lot of nice little suprises during our stay. Thank you so much for the wonderful time
50700967,Emily July 2022 We can highly recommend staying at the Olive groove! If you enjoy being in nature that’s the place to be. There are some beaches in the area which are in walking distance but a car/scooter would be helpful. The host Debbie is a wonderful person..she delivers super delicious cake and wine every now and then. She puts so much effort into details..there even is a guitar. And mosquitos will be your best friend at night :)
50700967,Maria July 2022 easily the best airbnb i’ve ever stayed in. the place is amazing and the host   Debbie is ever more amazing ! She provided everything we needed and more . The airbnb has some truly breathtaking views . 10000/10 recommend . Thank you so much Debbie! Will definitely visit again!
50700967,Natalie June 2022 The cabin was such a beautiful place to stay  made even better by Debbie and Nicholas’ kindness! The campsite is luscious and green and has a well equipped shared kitchen  and many seating areas  even a treehouse. The cabin was a comfortable size  it was great to have our own shower and bathroom  our own little balcony area  and the large mosquito net around the bed was pretty perfect but do bring some mosquito spray and be prepared live amongst the nature! The beach is around a 25 min downhill walk and the village around 10-15 mins walking. We had a great time and were glad to stay somewhere so beautiful!
50700967,Nicole October 2022 We stayed 2 nights in the wooden hut at the end of September and it was a great nature experience. You can even hear the sound of the sea and the air is wonderfully fresh. The shared kitchen and also the bathroom are well equipped. Here you will find everything for cooking  but also for leisure  such as snorkeling or a guitar. The perfect experience for nature lovers with the perfect hosts. 5 stars 🌟 Translated from German  Show original
50700967,Sandra September 2022 Nice place to stay  but not suitable for weather! Translated from German  Show original
50700967,Lele July 2022 place for those who love it  you are in the middle of nature  and what nature...with all the pros and cons of the case  of course. nature knows how to be aggressive ( Debbie knows what I mean..😀) the place itself is very interesting  but the rare gem is the host  a person who gives serenity in every word  a privilege to have met her. good location if you want to travel the whole island a bit  in short  highly recommended Translated from Italian  Show original
14479254,Paulina September 2021 Great place  amazing view  wide beach. Rose prepared for us a little welcome smack  gave us usefull tips for bus  market  car rent. The city is intimate  there are no good restaurants or supermarkets  but great place to rest.
14479254,Yana August 2021 Perfect location right next to the beach and incredible balcony view. We had an amazing time in this apartment! So  we can recommend this place. Rosa was very thoughtful and helpful during our stay. Thank you!
14479254,Zoi June 2021 ARIA maisonette in Glyfada Beach is a gorgeous place to stay! We loved every moment in ARIA.  Just renovated  with tasteful furniture and bright spacious rooms! Incredible views of the sea which is within walking distance (200m away). ARIA was sparkling clean and we felt safe and at ease from a hygienic point of view. ARIA has all mod cons and equipment for cooking at home if you wish.  Rosa  the hostess  is an incredibly kind person  made us feel very welcome and she responded very fast to our questions. Whilst Rosa is local  she has travelled the world and therefore  she was able to provide us with fantastic suggestions that suited our every need.  We are definitely coming back very soon! Thank you Rosa <3
14479254,Thomas September 2020 Rosa is a loveley host. The appartment is perfect for a family. The balkonies have an amazing view and you can get to the beach in under 5 minutes. I can recommend this appartment!
14479254,Marián September 2020 Amazing owner  beautiful place with astonishing view close to the beach. Everything was taken care of by the owner and we didnt need to care about anything and just relax.
14479254,Cara August 2020 We had a relaxing time staying in Rosa's apartment which is part of a complex of apartments next to the big  sandy and beautiful Glyfada beach. It was lovely waking up to sit on the balcony and watch the sea! Rosa was very kind and helpful during our stay. The only downsides are that the wifi in the apartment complex is too weak  and the door to the second bedroom does not close. There is a restaurant on the beach and we visited there to use their wifi and do a bit of work.
14479254,Davide July 2022 very nice apartment  on two levels (day and night) a stone's throw from the sea. Parking included. Translated from Italian  Show original
52506822,Elizabeth October 2022 What a privilege to say in this lovely well equipped villa. Everything was spotlessly clean. The location right on the beach was perfect. The sun rise in the morning was spectacular. We enjoyed a wonderful relaxing week. Thank you.
52506822,Amanda October 2022 Very nice house with lovely views. The scenery is amazing! A bit out of the way but nothing a taxi or car rental couldn't fix. There was one or two issues like the storm blew out the internet and some electricity issues but this wasnt the fault of the owner. All in all we loved our stay and will hopefully return in the future
52506822,Jennifer October 2022 We had a pleasant week at Villa Pomme. The beach area is nice and so ist the house. Spacious rooms  bathrooms and kitchen was good for our group of people. The house keeper was nice  unforseen were groceries which were bought by him before our check in. A car is necessary due to the location far off the cities  which is what we were looking for a relaxing week.
52506822,Donika September 2022 Extremely tranquil and calm
52506822,Tom August 2022 Amazing house   perfect for a few families with kids . Beach at end of garden with very warm sea water . House is big . For a relaxing week away it’s very good value
52506822,George July 2022 Beautiful place with your own private sandy beach and shallow clean water  very clean big house  very responsive host  me and my family loved it and we will definitely go there again. I am recommending this place with no hesitation.
52506822,Ole July 2022 Very nice Villa overall  should remove some of the bunkbeds for doubles (+ missing a pool). Response from Pomme July 2022 There is a huge natural swimming pool a few steps from the house with naturally warm water at 70cm deep. What more could you ask for  a huge playground.! The swimming pool is for me completely useless.
52506822,Imante April 2022 The villa is in we're quiet place  on the beach abou 50 steps from the sea. In the villa you will find everything you need for a big family. The town it is not far away you can walk (we had a car  but we walk everyday. Not far from villa you vill find the fishermans were you could buy fresh fish. High recommendation for stay with company or a big family. We loved.
52506822,Nicolas November 2022 Great welcome  good location. Very nice house. Translated from French  Show original
52506822,Nathalie August 2022 Idyllic place  with private beach and especially people  we had the sea to ourselves!!!!! The relaxing area and the waterfront cabin are very pleasant. Lefkimmi is ideal to be in peace while having restaurants and supermarkets next door. We are delighted with our stay at this well equipped villa  very good bedding and air conditioning throughout. Hosted by extremely kind and helpful Greek guards. I really recommend this house. Nathalie Translated from French  Show original
52506822,Florian June 2022 We had a wonderful stay in Pomm's house. It is equipped with everything you need for a nice holiday with your friends. Especially beautiful is the large kitchen where you can cook together. Afterwards  you can enjoy the evening on the terrace with a beautiful view. The check-in/check-out also went smoothly and the communication was excellent. The neighbors who take care of the house were also super nice and took great care of us. The highlight is the beach a few steps away from the house. A great way to relax! Beautiful water and some snorkeling opportunities are also available!! All around a fantastic vacation!! Thank you for that!! Translated from German  Show original
53121232,William September 2022 An amazing villa with the most fantastic views. I couldn’t recommend Villa Helena any more.
53121232,Isabel July 2022 We had a lovely stay with our family! the house is super spacious and comfortable  great pool and outstanding support from our host! The house is located in the middle of the island so you can go anywhere from there. There are supermarkets nearby (by car) where you can get everything you need. We will for sure go back!!
53121232,Nicholas June 2022 Wow - a truly remarkable vacation. Johnny went above and beyond to make sure we were cared for like we were his own family! Not to mention  the villa is astonishing. The views are second to none  and the appliances are all brand new and clean. Having a washer and dryer was a huge plus! A luxury vacation is what you will receive when you stay at Villa Helanes!
53121232,Justine August 2022 Johnny is very welcoming and very attentive to his tenants. Translated from French  Show original
45064171,Lynnette October 2022 The apartment had everything we needed. Great size and included both bathroom towels and beach towels which was handy. Well stocked with shampoo and shower gel and other bits in the kitchen.  We went in the October half term so the tavernas and supermarket at this beach were closed for the season. Which we didn't realise when booking. It meant the beach was quiet which was lovely but we needed to plan each meal out. We would definitely stay here again.
45064171,Natasha October 2022 What a place! Real paradise. We've been there for 2 weeks (with a little baby!) during low season and it was absolutely awesome. 2 minutes to the beach is the luxury. To wake up with such a view is a pure happiness.
45064171,Anett September 2022 Five star accomodation! 5 csillag!!!!
45064171,Katherine August 2022 Lovely property and location. Michael was very responsive with all questions.
45064171,Jc August 2022 Great place!!!Easy access to the beach and restaurants. Nice views
45064171,Andreas July 2022 We really enjoyed our stay here! Due to our flight being pretty late  we arrived at the house at exactly 22:00  which was no problem. We had a problem with the downstairs AC not turning on  which Theodora quickly helped us resolve by using a universal remote for one of the upstairs units. There was plenty of water and fresh fruits in the fridge on arrival  which was very good as we were not able to buy much on that day due to our late flight. The house was clean  and there was a good supply of fresh towels  even extra large towels to use at the beach. The bathrooms were also stocked with shower gel and soap  and there was a blowdryer in the upstairs bathroom which was not even listed in the description! The faucet in the upstairs bathroom however was not very pleasant to use  as the water sprays in multiple small jets in different directions  meaning you will likely get water on your clothes. The WiFi connection in the house was stable and had good speed (~50 Mbit). The location of the house is very good if you plan to visit the beach often  as it is only a ~ 2 minute walk! However I would still recommend getting a rental car  as you probably will want to go grocery shopping outside of Glyfada and visit some restaurants out of town aswell. Show more
45064171,Alexandra June 2022 A lovely property in a great location just a few minutes from the beach. Views from the upstairs balcony were beautiful and the property is very well equipped. Air conditioning throughout was very welcome as was the good supply of towels and cleaning products ie. capsules for washing machine  dishwasher etc. Ideal for a relaxing beach holiday but still only 30 minutes from Corfu town by car  or a little longer by bus  as we did and only €4.40 return.
45064171,Melissa June 2022 THIS PLACE IS FABULOUS! Michael and the folks in there are wonderful. We spent a month in Glyfada and enjoyed this amazing home base. The apt. has plenty of room for maybe five  there were only three of us. The beach is beautiful and the people are warm and welcoming.  I would encourage to have a rental car if you're going to be there for a while. It's just easier to get around the island  but if you're only there for a week  you have five or so really close restaurants and a couple of markets that are all within a short walk...really short walk.
45064171,Emma April 2022 Perfect location  great beach. Comfortable accommodation.
45064171,James April 2022 This place is amazing! Over and beyond on service! A 3 minute walk to the softest sand! You won’t be disappointed!!!
45064171,Derya September 2021 Host: very kind  helpful  always available  perfect communication. The house: very clean. Very Tidy. Perfect view to the sea. Nice rooms and baths. Family friendly. Only 2 mins walk to the public sandy beach with crystal clear water. Location: a really good place for people who are looking for a relaxing holiday. There are also few taverns and restaurants. Also  the Green Buses run from Kerkyra town to Glyfada. Note: the tap water is not drinkable in the island it might be advantageous to get water from the shops in Kerkyra town beforehand.  All in all  we really enjoyed Glyfada and the house. I recommend this place.
45064171,Florian August 2021 Perfect for families with kids! We really enjoyed our stay!
45064171,Phương August 2021 Good
45064171,Jose August 2021 Michael is an excellent host and the place amazing and location outstanding  everything above expectations. Thank you Michael for all and your attentions   I highly recommend Michael’s place - Jose
45064171,Ramune August 2021 Thanks. It was great.
45064171,Beatriz July 2021 It’s in a very good location! The house is clean and the attention is excellent!
45064171,Tilo July 2021 Great Stay  Highly Recommended!  Place: It’s a two story row house with a balcony upstairs  a terrace downstairs and a little garden. It’s second row from the Beach  so super close (200m walk into the water). Nice Ocean View. The place was super clean  the two bathrooms newly renovated  new dish washer and big fridge in the kitchen  comfy mattress and three working air cons. Upstairs there is the two bedrooms (both with AC)  one bathroom and balcony. Downstairs is the big kitchen and living room area and a terrace. It’s located at Glyfada Beach  one of the nicest sandy beaches in Korfu. Communication with the landlord was super friendly and easy. I would definitely recommend the place and go there again. Nothing to complain. Thanks a lot.
45064171,Aleksandra September 2020 Great contact with the host. Fully equipped house for 4 people with a child. Only 3 minutes on foot to a beautiful beach  shop or tavern.
45064171,Gitte July 2022 Our family of three children (7  13 and 16 years) and two adults have had a wonderful stay. The house is well equipped with two bedrooms and a sofa bed in the living room  two bathrooms and a fully functioning kitchen with oven. There are plenty of towels in the house-both large beach towels and regular beach towels. The house is in a fantastic location  right down to a lovely sand stand. We had rented a car  which was nice  but you can definitely do it by public transport if you're just going for a week. We give the place our warmest recommendation🌟 Translated from Danish  Show original
45064171,Petra July 2022 Nice place with all the essentials. Just a few minutes to the beautiful sandy beach and a small supermarket. During the day quite a lot of activity on the beach by many day visitors  in the evening in the restaurants there was not much going on. The place is a purely tourist resort  with 4 restaurants and 2 small supermarkets. A rental car is recommended. In all the rooms there was air conditioning  which you also needed in the heat. The two terraces were also beautiful. We liked it. Translated from German  Show original
45064171,Dirk July 2022 We felt very comfortable. Earlier check-in and check-out was not a problem and were handled easily by the host-thank you. Mini market and restaurant in the immediate vicinity. Short walk to the beautiful beach. Translated from German  Show original
45064171,Jany October 2021 Pleasant house with a beautiful view. Translated from French  Show original
45064171,Angela July 2021 Extremely friendly and fair host  modern and fully equipped apartment - right on the beautiful sandy beach Glifada; city easily accessible by public transport. Highly recommended! Translated from German  Show original
54404392,Peter September 2022 We felt very well at Spiros and Amalie's place  like at our friends' place. If you are looking for a quiet place away from the hustle and bustle with a nice view and not far from the beach  this is a great choice. A big plus for us was the garden and the children's corner. The food was really excellent. Amelia and Spiros are very nice people and great hosts. Thank you for a great time! Peter   Sincerely  Peter
54404392,Barbora September 2022 Spiros and his mother Amalie are excellent hosts and friendly people. Everything was perfect. Apartment was fully equipped  clean  perfect service  every meal we got was so tasty. When we arrived we got homemade wine and pie and the dinner was also prepaired for us. Next morning we got big breakfast and the sea view…Amazing! We can highly recommend this accommodation. Hope we come back next year. 👋
54404392,Tamsin September 2022 Beautiful stay at Spiros’! Just a minutes walk to the beach  beautiful garden  Spiros is a great cook and lots of restaurants and bars along the beach  perfect relaxing getaway. Will be back!!
54404392,Olivia August 2022 Position of the house is perfect  Spiros  Alexandros and their Mum are very kind and helpful person  it was like beeing at home. Everything was perfect and also Spiros Dinners were wonderful  I suggest you everything there. Vacation was wonderful there! THANK YOU We are really happy
54404392,Maja August 2022 We traveled as a family with children (6 and 12 years). We all had a wonderful and relaxing time. The property is set in a flowering garden with great views of the ocean. The apartment was great for us. The children each had their own area with us in the room with a bed  which was accessible via a steep staircase. Everything was well secured by railings and very solidly built. Most importantly: Spiros and Amalia were incredibly warm. We have always been spoiled with fruit and cakes. To order  Spiros cooks excellent meals for guests. He was very much in line with our wishes. Our children also liked Spiros dishes very much. They also enjoyed being able to play in the garden when we were eating even longer. We thank Spiros  Amalia and Aleksandros and recommend a stay there to everyone!

26450591,David October 2022 We have just returned from a fabulous week at this beautiful villa.  Everything was perfect. We were welcomed by George from host lab who showed us round and ensured that everything was in place. The villa was everything we could ask for and more.  Beautiful location  thoughtful aspects - such as leaving some local produce  amazing pool along with other lovely touches. Rita was so helpful with anything we need (even finding a precious ring after we had left!). I would recommend this for anyone who wants a perfect holiday in Corfu. We would love to return again sometime in the future. Thank you
26450591,Heather October 2022 Our family of four had one of the best holidays ever at this gorgeous house in Corfu. Everything was perfect. we hope to return soon.
26450591,Tom October 2022 Amazing stay at Astrit & Rita’s place! Fantastic views from a beautiful home. Astrit was there on arrival to show us around the house  & Rita popped in throughout the week to check in & stock us up with whatever we needed. Car & confident driver is a must as this villa is high in the hills with a steep/tight driveway. Kassiopi only 10 minute drive  & just under 1hr to airport.
26450591,Chris October 2022 What a beautifully stunning Villa. We stayed as a couple for a quiet week away from it all.  The host and wider team were fantastic and highly responsive to resolve any questions we had  and even quickly attended the location to provide a first aid kit!  The Villa is perfect to enjoy the sun by the pool  or the indoor fire to relax.  We’ll definitely look forward to returning  and we’ve already recommended it to our friends.
26450591,Sophie September 2022 This is a wonderful  stylish villa with the most beautiful views of the coast and Albania. It is perfectly situated up the hill in the peaceful calm but is only 10 minutes away from Kassiopi and other beaches. There is a plunge pool (no steps in) enjoying the views and a side shallow area for young children. The sun loungers are very comfortable and the outdoor table perfected shaded. Rita looked after us brilliantly with the fridge stocked with essentials when we arrived  helped with any queries and kept the villa spotless. Highly recommend you book and enjoy this very special place. We shall return!
26450591,Rachel September 2022 We have just returned from a wonderful week of rest  fun and relaxation at Astrit and Rita’s beautiful home. The booking was smooth and communication with Hostlab fast and clear. Astrit met us upon arrival and showed us around the villa which really was a home from home. A very kind and thoughtful welcome pack was gladly received which helped us to settle in very quickly. The villa itself is a masterful creation of Astrit’s hard work. Rita has styled and designed it beautifully to compliment the stone and hand built wooden features throughout. Stepping out to the outdoor pool area is quite simply breathtaking. The view out to Albania and beyond is stunning and good for one’s soul. A beautiful hand built outdoor kitchen area compliments this area where you can enjoy meals around the solid wood table and enjoy using the outdoor barbecue with the use of all tools provided. An added bonus for us was using another outdoor asset  the wood fired pizza oven. Rita so kindly prepared dough and the most delicious fresh tomato pizza sauce. The pizza’s were immensely enjoyed and would rival any Italian Pizzeria - if we can say so ourselves! Rita was on hand throughout our stay making us feel so welcome. We would not hesitate to recommend a stay in this villa and will most definitely look forward to one day returning. It felt like staying in our own private 5 star hotel with complete peace and privacy. We have returned with a weeks worth of wonderful memories that will last a lifetime. Show more
26450591,Tania August 2022 The most fabulous villa in the most amazing setting . The views to the sea were stunning . Our hosts were exceptionally kind and had thought of everything . They were on hand to give us great recommendations as well which was very helpful. The villa is incredibly well situated and is a 10 Minute drive to most good restaurants and beaches !
26450591,Steph July 2022 Wonderful villa with amazing views and so beautifully furnished. The pool is incredible. We spent hours just taking in the peace and beauty of the location around the pool. Rita and Astrit were so helpful  leaving fresh food and wine and helping with boat hire etc We cannot recommend it enough Steph  Dave and family
26450591,Steve June 2022 The Villa is fantastic  great views  very private and very well equipped for a lovely family holiday. The BBQ and PIZZA oven facilities were a big hit the kids and Miss Rita is a great host. We will certainly be returning.
26450591,Jaanus May 2022 Perfect Villa to stay in when visiting Corfu. It has everything you may need - great views to sea and mountains  beautifully decorated house and a pool. The hosts were really helpful and gave us tips on the places to visit. Would recommend the stay for everyone.
26450591,Tara May 2022 The Sinium villa is beautiful. The view from the villa and the pool is something me and my family will never forget. Rita and George were extremely helpful throughout our trip and always responded quickly to any queries we had. The decoration and finish of the villa was immaculate and I would not hesitate to stay at the villa again in the future.
26450591,Michel & Jacqueline May 2022 We’ve had a wonderful time in this wonderful house. We visted with our teenage children. There was enough room and privacy for all of us  so important! The view is spectacular and the house feels warm and cozy  it has a good vibe. Be sure to rent a car though  the hills are steep! The host is caring and the communication was easy and pleasant. Lovely place!
26450591,Harvey April 2022 My daughter said that this is the best Airnb place she has ever stayed at - and the whole family immediately agreed. This is a spectacular villa perched in the hills of Kassipoi with amazing views of the ocean. Close to all amenities and lots of sight seeing places close by. Superb  friendly and attentive team who helped with any and all of our needs. Great value for money.
26450591,J April 2022 This is a fabulous air b n b - the accommodation is to an incredibly high standard - it’s a beautiful villa with amazing views. Rita is hugely helpful and gave us lots of top tips for beaches and tavernas. We loved the pool  table football and ping pong. We will definitely be going back.
26450591,Steven October 2021 This property is simply wonderful. We have stayed in many villas  and the view from this one is by far the best we've had. And the property itself is so lovely – it's got everything you need and for a rental is very highly finished. Rita  who was our host  was amazing – very helpful and welcoming – without being intrusive. We would definitely go again.
26450591,John October 2021 Amazing from beginning to end. Rita and Astrid were amazing throughout the week and nothing was too much trouble.  The villa was as breathtaking in real life as the photos. Facilities and living accommodation within the villa were superb and suited us very well.  Good location and only ten minutes to Kassiopi  lovely little beaches  shops etc.  Fantastic week and can’t wait to go back!
26450591,Paula October 2021 A great secluded villa perfect for a family or friends. Of course you need a car but most things are only 10 mins away. Beautiful views and the villa has everything you need. Rita was there when you needed her and provided great tips and recommendation. Perfect for a family. The third bedroom is a on the small side great for kids maybe not so great for 2 adults as the bed is a small double with the bathroom downstairs. But this is a minor thing we had a great stay
26450591,Neil October 2021 Magical house in a magical location in the hills overlooking the sea. My family and I spent a wonderful week here. Rita was very kind and even booked a boat trip for us. The craftsmanship everywhere around the house is incredible. I would highly recommend this place for families or a ground of friends looking to spend quality time together. You will definitely need a car to reach the house as the road up is a little sketchy at times but no more so than any other road in the hills of Corfu.
26450591,Sigrun September 2021 The Sinium luxury villa is absolutely wonderful! Very tastefully decorated throughout and supplied with high quality homeware. And the host Rita thought of absolutely everything  from supplying some necessary food essentials on our arrival as well as accommodating every request during our stay  including some home made pizza dough!  We had our small baby with us and they supplied a travel cot  high chair and baby bath for our use. The villa is great for families but also for a small group of friends. They have a large bbq area  a wood fired pizza oven  table football and an amazing infinity pool with views over Albania across the sea. The nearest town is just a 10-15 minute drive away with lots of lovely places to eat and a couple of pretty beaches. If you’re looking for a private place to enjoy some time in the sun  this villa is definitely for you :) I will definitely be staying here again!
26450591,Emma September 2021 Fantastic place. Can’t rate it highly enough
26450591,Kelly June 2021 This place is INCREDIBLE. Absolutely gorgeous interior design  amazing infinity pool with views to die for  comfortable bed and nice quality linens. Everything is amazing. There is so much love put into this place by Rita and her family - you can see it everywhere in the attention to detail  the hand carved wood features  the fresh herbs and garden  everything is so beautiful and well thought out. It was truly amazing. We came with a baby and Rita thought of everything - a high chair  cot  baby bath and she even bought our little one a lovely gift. The pool has a large shallow area perfect for little ones. This is a beautiful stay and very close to Kalami and kassiopi with loads of restaurants. Book it!
26450591,Anna June 2021 Absolutely stunning villa  even more beautiful in reality than in photos. Very spacious  with all appliances possible to have a comfortable stay for 6. Beautiful pool which can be heated up to about 32C; and garden with sun loungers  mint & rosemary bushes  a small vegetable garden  a grill area and a large table to enjoy the views from. And a spacious terrace with sofas on the top floor. The villa is slightly off the beaten track and a car is necessary to drive to the towns (Kassiopi  Kalami) and beaches nearby. I highly recommend renting a 4x4 for less experienced drivers as the drive to the villa is up  up  up :)
26450591,Ian October 2020 We had a week that just kept giving  the hospitality from the hosts Rita & family was special so thoughtful so kind. The villa WOW!! Location Pool Facilities the best we can’t wait to return.
26450591,Konrad October 2020 This place is spectacular! From the first moment we had a feeling that we are at home and enjoyed our time all the time. Host is very nice and supportive for any request and explanations about the home and island. I highly recommend and definitely will be back in the future.
26450591,Karsten October 2020 Incredible view from the patio as well as from the infinity pool. Nice hosts and many small villages as well as nice beaches just minutes away by car. There’s literally everything available in the house and even fruits  honey and local products on arrival along with a warm welcome! The kids loved the warm pool - we can recommend it for kids! Hope to be back soon!
26450591,Tom & Eve September 2020 The villa is sure spectacular! Absolute privacy and peace. We used the pool every day and enjoyed the fantastic views. We can recommend this villa to everybody who loves luxury and privacy.
26450591,David September 2020 Just the most amazing villa - first class construction  every detail has been considered. Rita and her husband are amazing hosts and you will LOVE the infinity pool and long range views of sea and mountains!
26450591,Emma August 2020 Sinium is an incredible villa with the most beautiful views. Made even better with stunning  well designed terraces and pool with great planting all around. We were welcomed with a wonderful food parcel including fresh fruit and veg from the garden. And Rita made us the best pizza dough so that we could cook our own pizzas in the pizza oven. It’s an outstanding villa and definitely worth the trip up into the hills where it’s a bit cooler and unbeatable views.
26450591,Chris August 2020 Without doubt the best villa we have stayed at. The pictures on the listing do not do it justice and the views are quite spectacular. The design of the villa is incredibly well thought out and they make excellent use of local and natural materials. There are countless great beaches nearby but we needed up spending afternoons by the pool which benefited from a bit more of a breeze. It is hard to think of any negatives  however you should be aware that the smaller bedroom does not have air con. The hosts Astrid and Rita are fantastic and cannot do enough to help.
26450591,Nathalie July 2020 We had an amazing time at Rita’s house. It’s wonderfully private yet close to the beach and the town of Kassiopi. Rita was a wonderful host. Would highly recommend.
26450591,Patrick July 2020 Very nice house  very clean.
26450591,Hannah October 2019 We had such a lovely stay  the villa was just perfect for what we wanted. Rita was so lovely and helpful and hd stocked the house with some lovely food for our arrival. Everything has been thought through with so many personal touches. The pool was great  we loved that it was fresh water and not full of chemicals. Rita arranged a day to come and clean so she wouldn't disturb us but was always at the end of the phone should we have needed her. The location is beautiful  the view is just stunning and although you need a car to get around it is only 10 minutes from Kalami and Kassiopi  both of which have everything you need. We can't wait to return!
26450591,Catherine October 2019 Absolutely gorgeous villa  with everything you need plus more to make your stay comfortable. The hosts were so generous and left lovely little touches like food and toiletries etc  cleaned the property whilst we were there but also left us to have our own independence so it felt very much like 'our' home whilst we were there. Traveled with a 2yr old and was great for a toddler with shallow parts of the pool he could go in etc. Couldn't recommend enough!!
26450591,Andy October 2019 We had an incredible week long stay. The pool and view have to be seen to be believed. Rooms are fully kitted out and the beds super comfy. If you’re considering Corfu then this is the place!
26450591,Tecwyn September 2019 Rita is a wonderful host  helping us from the moment we arrived to the minute we left. Property is stunning and the best Airbnb we have experienced. Highly recommend this property for a luxurious break. Car is required! Wonderful place  would stay there again
26450591,Andrew August 2019 The setting is outstanding and the villa fabulous. It is a great  private oasis with amazing views  lots of space (though  admittedly  we were only two) and good amenities. Rita and Astrit were very helpful and accommodating and couldn't have been lovelier. Really a special place to relax and get away from the normal day to day.
26450591,Renate July 2019 Rita is such a lovely person  nothing is to much for her! The house is a bit far away from restaurants or supermarkets but nothing beats the wonderful view and accommodation! Be prepared for the mosquitos at the morning or evening in the veranda  there is a big pizza oven to organize your own pizza party  the pool is wonderful and cleaned almost every day  the kitchen has everything to comfort a home cook (except for the baking pans they are not really good  I think they are not supposed to be washed in the dishwasher)  Thank you Rita  we've had a great stay! All the best!
26450591,Clement June 2019 Astonishing view. Swimming pool with 'baby area'. Good equipment. Our local contact was very reactive and supportive (suggestions of local Car Rental  suggestions for Cooking Chef). Highly recommended!
26450591,Dennis May 2019 The villa is incredible right down to the smallest details. The view alone is worth the price. Add to that the incredible pool  outdoor dining and cooking area  secluded and quite surroundings and you got yourself the perfect spot for your vacation. We are already looking through our calendar to see  when we can go back.
26450591,Diego April 2019 This is a beautiful and stylish villa with a truly exceptional view over a Mediterranean forest  the blue sea and Albania. The hosts are extremely friendly and kind  they made us feel at home  pampered us  made little surprises and gave us good tips when we asked. The house is fully equipped  with absolutely anything you might need. It is very quiet and not too far (about 15 min driving) from a little coastal town with restaurants  and from beautiful beaches. The swimming pool is clean and with running water which makes you feel as if you were lounging close to a river in a magical forest. We have spent a wonderful time.
26450591,Steve April 2019 Amazing house and view with very friendly hosts
26450591,Charlotte October 2018 A beautiful villa with stunning views and everything thought of for a really relaxing stay
26450591,Dario October 2018 My stay in Siniés village with Astrit and Rita was the highlight of my stay in Corfu. Nestled on top of a hill overlooking Corfu  the Ionian sea and with views of Sarande and Butrint in Albania  this beautiful home is the stuff of dreams - with magnificent sunrises and spectacular sunsets. The house is so peaceful  with sounds of cicadas and birds for company and so many nooks to relax  read and take in the views. The home itself is just stunning - built by Astrit and decorated by Rita  it's full of personal touches - from the charming veranda  to the beautiful  well appointed kitchen  craftsman details throughout  gorgeous refreshing pool  all surrounded by olive trees  flowering shrubs  Mediterranean herbs and nature. If you fancy going into town  Kassiopi is just mere kilometers away  as is Kalami bay  where one can visit one of the former Durrell residences. I was warmly welcomed by Rita and her mother and got to meet Rita's family on my stay - their warm  genuine hospitality truly shines through ! My stay at Sinium Villa was absolutely spectacular in every respect  thank you Rita and Astrit for a truly memorable stay!
26450591,Niko October 2018 Fantastic views from almost every room of the house and from every point of the property gave us a perfect relaxation and recovery during our one week stay. Everything is new  high standard and tasteful decorated. Kassiopi is in reach (about 6 km) but you need some time to get used to drive these winding and steep roads with the rental car. We enjoyed the well responsive service and communication with our hosts  who live close by.
26450591,Claudio September 2018 The stay we really enjoyed it and everything was perfect. I can recommend the house with the best of my conscience. the garden is beautiful  the pool is amazing.
26450591,Lucie August 2018 Rita & Astrid were the perfect hosts  nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was incredible  even down to proving toothbrushes  toothpaste  deodorant  sewing kit  first aid  shampoo  soap  conditioner and even hairspray and that was just in the bathroom. Rita had filled our fridge with local goodies to welcome us  including a bottle of wine a beers  so kind. The villa was stunning  they had thought of everything  and the pool view was the stuff of dreams! Rita cleaned the house twice during our 1 week stay but we never saw her  it was like Mary Poppins had been when we came home!  I would highly recommend this villa to anyone who wants beauty  class  5 star luxury and friendly hosts  truly a holiday to remember. Thank you Rita and Astrid.
26450591,Greg August 2018 The villa is perfect for a family holiday and very well appointed. The hosts did everything they could to ensure we had a wonderful time. We would recommend this property to anyone looking for a fantastic stay in Corfu and couldn’t have asked for more.
26450591,Joe August 2018 Amazing villa  fantastic views  add great hosts who are always available and you have the perfect villa. The pictures do not do it justice  the grounds are quite extensive with different areas offering seclusion when required  great for hide and seek! Centrally located for the best parts of Corfu and not too far for day trips to the south.
26450591,Michael July 2018 Mrs Rita and Mr. Astrid were the perfect hosts and welcomed us extremely friendly. The house exceeded our expectations to the maximum. Small details like an enjoyable smell by candles in the house till some groceries and fresh fruits in the fridge made our first hours in the house already perfect. The kitchen is fully equipped and we were able to cook and bbq’ for a decent group of friends. Another thing that impressed us a lot were all the handcrafted wooden furniture that Mr. Astrid has done himself. From the bed  shelf’s  even until the bin in the bathrooms. We have never seen so much love to detail. Not to mention the pool that had the perfect refreshing temperature and no smell of chlorine what so ever. Just wonderful!!  We felt like home and are planing to renting the house again for several weeks next summer. We’re looking forward to returning.
26450591,Goce July 2018 Lovely place for rest  beatiful stonehouse with amasing view  friendly and very welcoming hosts. Everything is brand new and modern and the house is perfect for families. Our stay there was amazing.
26450591,Julie April 2022 Thanks to Rita and Georges for a wonderful stay The house is beautiful   the views amazing  probably the nicest vacation rental for us! Everything was perfect   we'll be back with great pleasure Thanks again! Julie and Benoit Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Ambroise July 2021 Big disappointment ! The house presented on the site that we rented for its view  was occupied by other people. We were accommodated in a new villa located nearby (certainly comfortable inside)  but without the exceptional view or the possibility of having meals outside facing the sea. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Elisabeth September 2020 We really appreciated the tranquility and amenities at this place. Everything worked out well and we were received very kindly and with food purchased for breakfast from Rita. Her tips were valuable. We highly recommend the place. Translated from German  Show original
26450591,Dominique August 2020 Exceptional week in an idyllic location Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Bernard November 2019 Great stay in a unique and very comfortable place. Perfect welcome Translated from French  Show original
26450591,"Marie September 2019 Villa Sinium met and exceeded all our expectations! :-) We arrived late at night  the house was beautifully illuminated inside and out  partly with candles. Everything was as in the photos and even more beautiful  VERY well maintained with a lot of love for detail - everything was really thought of. So many wood handicrafts can be found inside and out  really great. You just have to experience the view live  there is no photo enough!!! You can't get tired of it... Finally  we need to mention our hosts  Rita and her husband  they are wonderful. Rita is so warm  was always available and very helpful  THANK YOU!!! 😊Upon arrival  a ""basic equipment"" such as bread  butter  jam  yogurt  milk  juice  wine and a huge fruit basket were already waiting for us  very attentive. We fell in love with this great house immediately and can absolutely recommend it! 💕 Translated from German  Show original"
26450591,Florent August 2019 The house is perfect  very well furnished  with a great view and very nice outdoor spaces. It's a great place to rest  the hosts are very available and everything is planned for you to have an unforgettable stay. Only small downside  the third bedroom is small  more suitable for children. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Severine August 2019 We particularly enjoyed our stay in this very well equipped  large and very comfortable house! We were greeted with a lot of nice little touches. The view is breathtaking   the pool is on a human scale and is very pleasant. Away from the crowds  we were quiet   with only the sound of cicadas! The villa is easily accessible with a paved road to the entrance of the property. Supermarket and a top pastry shop 5 min away  lively town of Kassiopi in the evening 10 min away   for Ipsos clubbers is 25 min away. The villa is very well located  sinceit allows you to visit a beach where a different city every day. Translated from French  Show original
26450591,Fabrizio June 2019 not easy to reach  the website should be given the best sign of the house Translated from Italian  Show original
26450591,Julia May 2019 The place is a dream come true. Everything is totally lovingly and tastefully decorated. The outdoor facilities are also absolutely insane. However  it is not suitable for toddlers  as the villa is located directly on the slope and you cannot let toddlers play carefree. We can 100% recommend the place - rarely felt so comfortable in a home. Translated from German  Show original
26450591,Svenja September 2018 Everything was perfect  the house was fantastically beautiful  very clean and very lovingly furnished with lots of small details. The hosts were so friendly and welcoming! We had a great stay and will definitely be back. Translated from German  Show original
26450591,Marc September 2018 Beautiful villa with all the modern comforts (and more)   but with the charm of an old house ... Everything is arranged in every detail ( toothbrushes   toothpaste   anti-mosquito lotion  etc ...) Impressive ... We loved the position of the villa .... No overlook   a green screen in front (olive trees and cypress as far as the eye can see) and this fabulous view of the Albanian coast.... The feeling of being alone in the world ... definitely the real luxury of this villa   even if again there is nothing lacking in amenities ... At the same time   the house is not far from the main sites of interest on the island  nor from the very good restaurants of Kassiopi ...   Recommended very highly .... Translated from French  Show original
19949966,Alessandro August 2019 Lucy was very helpful with everything and it’s was easy to get to the place. The room was clean and it manages to stay cool even in the summer heat so you don’t really need the A/C on to sleep well. Pelekas town is a short walk away (uphill)  but getting to the beaches on foot is quite taxing so a car or a scooter or any motorized vehicle are greatly recommended. Neighbors usually stay up late outside so don’t expect silence before at least midnight.
19949966,David October 2018 Apartment was neat and tidy outside area was nice. Pick up from airport much appreciated.
19949966,Manfred October 2018 We enjoyed very much staying in Zairas appartment  all was very nice  Zaira and here mother are very friendly and helpful for everything  romantic flair decorated appartment with nice details  wonderfully located with 5 beaches accessible with a bit of walk down to the sea  a nice place  thank you Zaira.
19949966,Iwona October 2018 Very relaxed place with large private terrace. Just few minutes (walk) to Pelekas village or Kontogialos beach (car recommended as apartment is on a hill). Very friendly  helpful host!
19949966,Natalie September 2018 Great communication  great location close to town  clean and would recommend. Thanks!
19949966,Martin September 2018 great location where you feel at home
19949966,Alienor August 2018 The flat is in an excellent location in a charming village near the beach  market  restaurants. The terrasse is perfect to take some drinks and diner. Zaira is a lovely person. She help us few times and always with the smile. If you come in Corfou i recommand her flat 100%!
19949966,Agnieszka July 2018 very nice host! close to the city of Pelekas and the beach - a steep road. beautiful garden and climate of Greece :) Recommend:)
19949966,Eugeniusz June 2018 The place is very quiet and peaceful with a charming little garden. We spent very pleasant moments.
19949966,Max April 2018 Great host - very friendly and hospitable. Zaira and her mother were extremely helpful to us on numerous occasions! The place itself is very cosy and also very neat and clean. We were really impressed with it in real life! It has everything that is needed and we would definitely recommend it to anyone. It was also only a few minutes drive to the beach and to the Village of Pelekas. On finding the apartment don't fully rely on the GPS  just follow the road to Pelekas. We also loved all the little details on the inside and outside of the apartment!
19949966,Mehmet April 2018 Zaira‘s apartment is a very nice place to have sweet little home base from very you easily can explore korfu. The Interieur is more than comfortable and the communication was excellent. S very humble and kind host  thank you very much.
19949966,Eva September 2017 Zaira is very hospitable  she got us some first need groceries and she picked us up and drove us to the flat. She is really sweet girl tho. The flat is super nice and cute  it is very clean. The location is really cool if you don't plan your vacations just chilling on the closest beach  because it's on the hill  but is really good if you prefer going around Corfu. It's easy to get there from the center (bus 11)  and her house is just next to the last bus station. there is an angency in Pelekas (with really nice boss) where you can rent a scooter  and there are many cool restaurants  and awesome view on the top of Pelekas.
19949966,Patrik August 2017 The apartment is situated between the village and the beach so you are in the center of your needs. The apartment is very nice  quite  clean an better equipped than my room at home! Zaira is very nice and courteous. She will even welcome you with some basic foods for your first days. I would marry her if she wouldn't be already.
19949966,Stephane August 2017 Our journey at Zaira place was perfect The location is only 5-10 min walking to PELEKAS center that is a charming village by the way (with good restaurants). Zaira is the best host ever! She even came to pick up us at the airport…Inside the apartment  this is very clean  well decorated  well equipped and with the air-conditioning. Furthermore  there is a charming garden with lemon  olive and kumquat trees. In brief  this is probably the best option to stay at CORFU for reasonable price. Don’t hesitate any longer!!!  Notre sejour chez Zaira a été parfait. L’appartement qu’elle loue est à seulement 5-10 minutes à pied du village de PELEKAS qui est un superbe endroit authentique avec de bons restaurants. Zaira nous a très bien reçus  elle est même venue nous chercher à l’aéroport. A l’intérieur  tout est très propre (fraichement rénové)  joliment décoré  avec tous l’équipement nécessaire et l’air conditionné (indispensable !). De plus  il y a un joli jardin fleurie avec des citronniers  des oliviers et un arbre à Kumquat. En bref  c’est probablement le meilleur rapport qualité/prix sur Corfu….FONCEZ ! Show more
19949966,Ravaka August 2019 We didn't get a chance to meet Zaira  but we can say that she is a host available and ready to respond to our requests. We were greeted by Mrs. Lucy  who is very kind both to guide us to the accommodation and to give us directions to places to visit and the best restaurants in the area. She's always available and smiling. You're just minutes from Glyfada Beach and Pelekas Beach  on a quiet hilltop street  so it's best to have your own vehicle. It has a garden with a very nice table to dine or relax. On hot days it gets humid  luckily there is air conditioning. Very affordable price compared to other listings in the area and given the period. We hope to be back! Translated from Italian  Show original
19949966,Mathieu November 2018 Very good stay  Zaira is attentive and helpful. In addition  she is very responsive and friendly. There are two single beds attached to each other. We recommend this place. Translated from French  Show original
19949966,Luc August 2018 The accommodation has a very nice small garden. The room is spacious. Beautiful coves nearby. Translated from French  Show original
19949966,Emeline November 2017 Ideally located to enjoy the sunset ! and also ideal for a sunny breakfast... Our stopover was very nice  we recommend ! Translated from French  Show original
33436467,Skye October 2022 AMAZING! Beautiful property! Kitchen is nice  pretty stocked  has a blender but no food processor. Two coffee makers  one regular coffee machine with paper filters and glass container  and one cappuccino maker.  The view is even better than the photos. The walls are very nice and modern. Bathrooms are very nice. The lowered couch outside is epic and very clean for white cushions  perfect condition!!!  Olives trees surround the back side of the property!  Even the driveway is GORGEOUS with red flowers! Fantastic for photos!  AC units are nice  with clickers for every room  so each room can control their temp.  Thank Kostas & Anita for sharing your beautiful home with us! Show more
33436467,Joseph D. July 2022 amazing place to stay  like something out of a dream. Hosts were lovely and 100% recommend this place.
33436467,Harminder May 2022 Amazing place! Jill & Kostas were great hosts and the rest of the prestige villa team. They helped us in getting a car and offering fresh towels each morning. The villa and the view are amazing!
33436467,Julia April 2022 This places deserves 10 stars!! Everything about this place and our stay was perfect. The owners of this place were incredible and we can’t thank them enough. The images don’t even do the place justice - it is so much better in reality!! Thank you for having us!
33436467,Vanessa September 2021 It was so gorgeous! The Villa and his owner Jill and Kostas are awesome and so lovely. I can recommend a stay there to everyone. I can only advise you if you staying there with 8 People  rent two small cars because it could be complicated with the driveway. But Kostas is happy to help you. But all in all don’t hesitate to rent the villa! (:
33436467,Hp August 2021 Villa Anthelia is a very high standard villa. The view is marvellous from morning to incredible sunsets  as on the gorgeous pictures showing it . The owners (Costas G. and his wife Gill) and the agent Prestige Villas of Corfu are very helpful and gave us invaluable tips to make our journey memorable.  Don't forget your snorkelling gears as the sea   (small deck 200m bellow)  wonderfully clean and full of life . Special thanks to the Italian cook (Giulia Burdet) who offered so many good things as well as her incredible know how.
32757261,Aleksandra July 2022 Amazing place  right at the beach. Apartment is equipped with everything you may need. The view is gorgeous and you can just hop to the sea and then relax in The privacy of the garden. You might need a car though  the restaurants that are within walking distance are not very nice and quite pricey. There are amazing places 10-15 minutes away from the property.
32757261,Alejandro April 2022 Wifi didn’t work
32757261,Ilta August 2021 The perfect place for a family with young kids. Waking up everyday to that view is what I am going to miss the most. The house is right on the beach a sandy beautiful shore. Parking space reserved inside the resort  really helpful in a fully packed place. The place was 30min distance by car from Corfu old town  which at first we thought was a bit long but we got to drive nearly every night there. Near Glyfada there’s also Pelekas  with nice restaurants and cocktail bars. I wouldn’t waste my time and money on the restaurants near the house  expensive and not very friendly service.
32757261,Alexander July 2021 If you like to be close to the beach but nevertheless be able to explore the whole island from a central location you have found the perfect spot! We wil definitely be back for another stay!
32757261,André September 2020 The Appartment was incredible. It is directly located at the beach  only a few steps it needs. The beach and the view you will have from the terrace is just amazing. By the way  in our opinion Glyfada has one of the most scenic and beautiful beachs on Corfu. So all on all I can highly recommend this apartment. If there were any questions George was always available.
32757261,Oliver October 2019 Gorgeous location and while staying in the off-season means you may have to rely more on provisions brought from Corfu town  the solitude gained is ample reward.
32757261,Ibrahim September 2019 Great ocean front condo overlooking the west side of the island  worth a visit if you are in Corfu. Short drive into town and to other beaches.
32757261,Luzia June 2019 Very beautiful view  amazing beach! You definitively need a car. Within 10 minutes drive you‘ll find very good Greek tavernas.
32757261,Laurence April 2019 We had a geat Time. The flat is ideally situaded at the end of the beach in front on the shore  sitting on the grass of the garden  quietly toes in the sand and the view of the waves . Spiros is very friendly and kind.
32757261,Pauline September 2022 Very nice place and amazing views. Translated from French  Show original
32757261,Jürgen October 2021 The location of the apartment is top and the amenities good. You are right in the front row on the beach. In the off-season  it is very quiet and the garden is very well maintained. I would come back. Translated from German  Show original

13245126,Veronika August 2022 Very comfortable  large apartment  fully equipped. Very close to Corfu town  Aqualand and sandy beaches. Pool is also large and clean with sunbeds. All in all perfect but be sure to arrive with a small car.
13245126,Thomas August 2022 Dimitrios is a perfect host. the apartment is clean  the pool is big  you can contact dimitrios whenever you want. we loved it !
13245126,Sarah July 2022 Lovely Appartment  with some fantastic views and a really nice pool ! just a walk away from the picturesque village of Pelekas. Our host Dimitris was so welcoming and always at the end of a call if needed. We've had a wonderful holiday .

13245126,Way Off Kamil June 2022 A very nice place as a base in every direction of the island.  We were practically alone during our stay  so the pool was used practically only by us!  Very good contact with the Dimitrios  which was very helping!
13245126,Barbara May 2022 Apartment is spacious   clean with all amenities needed for your stay You definitely need a car to get to the beaches and to see the sights There is however a bus stop within walking distance to Pelekas and Corfu town The pool is lovely The views are stunning 10/10 We would definitely stay here again Barbara and Paul
13245126,Nina October 2021 Great appartment  in a central location with everything you need and a wonderful host.
13245126,Isabelle October 2021 Dimi is THE BEST HOST - responds to every request within minutes and gets everything sorted and arranged for you. Could not have asked for anything better. The location is great to access everywhere around the island (definitely get a rental car). We were totally spoiled having him as a host  thank you again!
13245126,Vlinder Juliet July 2021 A very nice apartment with a beautiful view and pool  I would recommend to rent a car if you want to explore the island.
13245126,Gilles June 2021 We enjoyed our stay at the apartement. The location to explore the island is perfect  the swimming pool was a nice ending on hot days. the apartement has everything you need and Dimi is always standby for extra tips and information.
13245126,Łukasz July 2020 We spent a great week in this apartment. The apartment is clean  comfortable and well equipped. The pool is big  clean and with a amazing view. Location is quiet which was good for us. I recommend renting a car to comfortably explore the nearby beaches. Dimitris was really nice  helpful and available at all times. I recommend this place to everyone :-)
13245126,Zdeno October 2019 Very nice place  very comfortable  perfectly equipped  with a good taste. Dimitrios is very kind  caring and helpful. House is out of a crowd but close to interesting points  with an amazing view from the pool and beautiful beaches very close.
13245126,Caroline October 2019 The accommodation was spotlessly clean  spacious and fully equipped with everything. It was peaceful with beautiful views from the balcony. The pool area was lovely  a really sunny spot to relax and enjoy the gorgeous sunshine. Not far from the village but it was a bit of a climb  but there are great cafes and tavernas there  offering lovely views. The Taverna just a few mins walk away  down the hill from the apartment was great  really delicious food. It is worth hiring a car if you want to explore the island and all its stunning scenery and views. Dimitris  our host  was available to contact and responded immediately  and was really helpful and friendly. A really lovely holiday.
13245126,Helen September 2019 Dimitrios is an excellent host and could not have been more helpful. He phoned as soon as we had landed to check where to meet him and then gave directions directly to our taxi driver arranging to meet at the taverna as apartment not too easy to find. I would highly recommend hiring a car which we did after the first day and realised the treck to the beach and back was too much and we are pretty fit. Pelekas beach is just perfect and the sea crystal clear. Corfu town is a 15 minute drive and such lovely places to eat and wander around.
13245126,Angela August 2019 Fantastic apartment in a beautiful location and great views from the pool and veranda  especially at sunrise. Just the right size and facilities for myself and 2 teenage children. Good sized pool and a blessing in the August heat. Take the shortcut through the olive groves into Pelekas village; takes just 7-8 mins  follow the well trodden footpath behind the apartments. Good choice of restaurants  Pink Panther and Acropolis for great views. Beach is beautiful  it's just a real trek! Dimitris was a fabulous host  kept in touch to make sure we were ok and very quick to respond to any questions I had during our stay. Thank you!
13245126,Carol July 2019 Lovely stay here. Dimitri a great host  stayed in touch with us during our stay. It was great to have a car and explore the beaches that Dimitri suggested. Apartment very comfortable and had all we needed. Discovered some beautiful bays and great tavernas in the area. A car or transport is very useful but not essential if you like walking. Thankyou for the hospitality
13245126,Marta June 2019 Amazing stay at Dimis place lovely  cozy apartment very clean.private swimming pool. Short distance to pelekas village and the best beach in our opinion-kontogialos beach.amazing views and tavernas on the beach. Hopefully see you again in Corfu. Thanks!
13245126,Cheryl May 2019 Lovely property  Dimitrious always available with any queries needed. Property lovely and clean near to the village. We had a lovely time and hope to return soon.
13245126,Inga April 2019 Dimitrios is a wonderful  hospitable and very careful host. The fabulous view from the balcony and pool area allows you to unwind and enjoy fantastic relaxation. The house is nice and cozy  maybe the kitchen might be a little bigger  but overall we did well. Dear gifts  both on arrival and on departure -we were delighted by heart. AirBnb pearl  we recommend!
13245126,Alexander October 2018 Dimitrios is a very friendly host and even gives you small gifts! The appartment is big  clean and well equiped. It is near pelekas  a lovely small traditional town. There is a nice little bakery on the corner of the main square you definetly should visit. Thank you dimitrios for the relaxing stay!
13245126,Josephine September 2018 Everything was great and very clean!!! Dimitris was a great host  suggested us places to visit in the island and almost everyday we had a communication with him either checking if we needed anything or suggesting us places
13245126,Mrs & Mr Preisner August 2018 Very nice appartment with 2 balconies and amazing view  very comfotable for 2  near the Pelekas  good communicated with Corfu town by bus. For exploring the island it is better to rent a car. Everything what needed to stay is there. We recommend the place :)
13245126,Lara August 2018 My children and I had a lovely time at Dimitrios's apartment. It was very clean and Dimitrios is a generous and kind host who welcomed us personally and was easily contactable if we needed any advice. We enjoyed the pool and balconies and the apartment is in a great location for exploring the area. We hired a car  which I would recommend but it's only a short drive to some lovely clean beaches and the village. Thanks for a great time in Corfu!
13245126,Freek July 2018 The house is perfect in every way so no additional comments needed there. There is a small track going up the hill to the lovely village of Pelekas  which is a great hangout for your morning coffee or an afternoon drink. After that dive in the giant pool with a view or a short drive to Corfu city (really nice) or Glyfada beach (the best beach on Corfu in our opinion). Our host had a terrible week with some personal losses due to the fires in Athens  but amazingly he still showed up at our doorstep to see how his guests were doing...so Dimitrios: you are a tremendous host and on top of that a very kind and nice man. Thanks again!
13245126,Maroeska July 2018 My boyfriend and I had 2 amazing weeks in the apartment of Dimitrios. It's a nice place for young and old. Dimitrios is always there for you. We were even allowed to enter the house earlier! The house is clean  we didn't miss anything. The view on the balcony is great and we had a beautiful view when we were relaxing at the pool! The apartment is near to Pelekas: a cute village with nice  affordable restaurants. We rent a car for 2 weeks  that is a good option to explore the island. I recommend this place to everyone :-)
13245126,Jo June 2018 From the moment we made our first enquiry to the moment we departed Dimitrios was helpful. The apartment is clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the morning sun on the balcony and evening sun by the pool. I would recommend your own transport. We did walk to the beach and into Pelekas but the climb back up from the beach is fairly tough. Pelekas has some lovely restaurants and the bakers on the square has lovely pastry’s. Don’t miss trying Sonja’s taverna which is the traditional white and blue building at the far end of the beach. We did try other beaches but Pelekas was our favourite.
13245126,Fiodor June 2018 The apartment was everything you need on a sunny holiday in Greece. We thought we wouldn't use the swimming pool but we actually loved it  so did our 9 month old baby. Dimitrios was an amazing host  our flight was delayed by hours but he still personally met us at 12 at night near the local Taverna. We also traveled to different beaches in Corfu but found Pelekas Beach was the cleanest and least busy with tourists.
13245126,Laura June 2018 Lovely vacation and pleasant stay at Dimitrios. Very attentive and sweet host. We stayed in April for a week and felt like we had the whole place to ourselfes  very quiet and relaxing. Pelekas is a calm area with a few tavernas up on the hill. We wanted to expirience the whole island so we did not stay in one place for the whole time. The pool was an amazing spot to chill and freshin up. I would def recommend this apartment. Thank you!
13245126,Markus April 2018 Dimitrios was an amazing host  we couldn't have asked for more!
13245126,Eliza April 2018 Fantastic apartment and surroundings  much better than in the pictures. The apartment is perfectly clean  cosy  has really everything that you need for your stay. The bathroom is brand new and very stilish. The view from the balcony and the swimming pool is breathtaking. The localization couldn't be better. Dimitrios is a great host  who really takes care of his guests. Totally recommended!
13245126,Helen October 2017 Really enjoyed our stay at Dimi's place in Pelekas! Great little apartment with amazing views. Pelekas is a lovely village with great restaurants  incredible views and close to lots of amazing beaches. Dimitrios was great at keeping in touch and gave us lots of tips. Thanks for a great stay!
13245126,Margus September 2017 Place was nice and cozy and not far away from small village Pelekas. The host was very helpful with everything.
13245126,Sophie September 2017 Very nice host! The housing is perfect for holidays! No parking place in front of the apartment but there is plenty of space along the road.
13245126,Griober August 2017 The apartment is placed in a quit area with a nice view. For a family it is needed to have a car to enjoy all beautiful beaches around  as well as marvelous island Corfu.
13245126,Lucille July 2017 It is a beautiful and quiet place  you can reach great beaches in 5 or 10 minutes with a car  Corfou old town in 20 minutes! If you want to relax  the pool is very big and the water always warm  with a wonderful view to the sea and mountains. In the apartment you have everything you need to have a great vacation! :) Dimitrios parent's welcomed us  they were very lovely and tell us everything we needed to know! I will recommand this peaceful place to everyone ! ;)
13245126,Rebecca June 2017 Host was great  made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Location is quiet which was good for us. Would recommend renting a car to explore the area and access all the great beaches that are near by.
13245126,Leo June 2017 Absolutely great 5 days in such a relaxing location near the small village of Pelekas - Dimitri was a very attentive host always happy to help and very quick to reply to any and every query we had  would definitely stay here again!!
13245126,Sonja & Adam June 2017 Dimitrios is such an amazing host. From the moment of check in to check out he made sure everything was perfect. The pool is great and balconies on his place overlook a wonderful view. The area is really cute and a very short and beautiful walk into town. I would definitely recommend you get a car for hopping around Corfu.
13245126,Frances May 2017 The apartment is clean  comfortable and well equipped. The view from the terrace is wonderful. We enjoyed the pool and it's not far to the village where there are shops and restaurants. We had an excellent holiday.
13245126,Tomas September 2016 Dimitri's apartment was the best choice to stay on Corfu  We had an incredible stay  apartment was very well furnished  there's everything we needed  welcoming was awesome  friendly and from the first moment we felt very well. The apartment has been kept very clean. Dimitri was very helpful and always readily available to answer our questions and give us tips. The apartment itself is in a perfect location  with an amazing view  all area was clean and pool wonderful. Recommend visiting the apartment if you want to spend a beautiful holiday in Greece.  Dmitri was an excellent host  we had a great time and would gladly come back again.
13245126,Katie August 2016 Dimitrios was very helpful throughout - both before we arrived and had questions including arranging wi-fi access and throughout our stay he responded quickly to messages. The apartment was perfect for our family of 4 which included 2 teenagers who very much enjoyed the pool and the location was ideal for our first visit to Corfu. A fantastic holiday - thank you! Response from Dimitrios Andreas August 2016 Thank you very much for your excellent comments.I m very happy that you've had such a nice time in Pelekas .I hope to see you again. Super nice guest.I definitely recommend Thank you Show more
13245126,Cam August 2016 One of the best holidays ever. Landlord was very helpful and he paid attention to every detail to make us feel in Pelakas like in the paradise. Nothing to complain about. Thank you Dimitris! Response from Dimitrios Andreas August 2016 It was a pleasure having you as a guest I am so pleased that you had a pleasant stay and that you enjoyed my house and the location.
13245126,Mette July 2016 I enjoyed the holiday in 9 days with my two daughters aged 15 and 18. We had booked Dimitrios apartment  because it matched our desire for swiming pool  when we were not just for the beach. It was a good choice. The apartment is perfect placed near Pélekas  with beautiful views to the landscape  from the small terrace. We enjoyed the atmosphere. The best beaches are nearby  which we thought was fantastic. Dimitrios was a great host and we felt very welcome. I can only recommend Dimitrios apartment  if you go to Corfu. Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 I'm really glad you had a nice time at Corfu thank you very much for your kind words  I'm pleased you've had a nice time with your daughters . I'd love to have you as guests again. Translated  Show original
13245126,Tereza July 2016 Our stay at Dimis apartment was great. Apartment is big enough  there is balcony with a nice view and the pool is also perfect. We recieved bottle of wine  some fruit and pack of drinkable water  which was super cool. I would recommend to anyone who is not afraid of walking or has a car/scooter. There are hills everywhere but it's probably what makes Corfu so nice. Thanks Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 Tereza and Ondrej were fantastic guests  very nice and tidy persons. I would recommend them to every host I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
13245126,Elisabeth July 2016 Holiday at Dimitris were great. Apartment is beautifully situated. Views of the entire island are wonderful. The place is quiet. Dimitris provides everything you need when it comes to equipment. We felt pleasantly treated to. The distance to the town  shops and restaurants is close - it's very important. Pelekas is a very atmospheric location with nice people. Response from Dimitrios Andreas July 2016 Thank you very much for your kind review  I'm glad you enjoyed your stay :)
13245126,Lena October 2022 Dimitrios welcomed us very warmly and provided us with tips and recommendations throughout the stay. The location of the AirBnB is ideal to get to great beaches and downtown in a short time. There is a small deduction for cleanliness - apart from that  it all worked out. Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Amandine August 2022 great welcome from Dim the accommodation is perfect!!! the pool is very nice Dim was very attentive to us The accommodation is well located 5 min walk from Pelekas ideal for visiting the west coast and 15/20 minutes from Corfu city we highly recommend it!!! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Julien Et Caroline July 2022 Excellent hosting by Dimitrios who deserves the full title of Superhost He checks in with us during the stay and is good tips for excursions and places not to be missed The pool was rarely occupied by other tenants  the opportunity to enjoy it quietly with family The accommodation is well located (close to Corfu and the beach...) and very well furnished We had a lovely vacation for this first in Corfu Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Jevgenij June 2022 Very quiet and beautiful place. Perfect for a family holiday if you are planning to rent a car and get around the island. Dimitri is always available and solves any questions. Translated from Russian  Show original
13245126,Christelle August 2021 Great stay  very well located accommodation to travel the entire island. Dimitri is very welcoming and accessible. They're very quick to respond to your questions. It is available even for a very late arrival. So really I recommend it. great place with great pool Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Oliver August 2021 Super accommodation in a great location. Very friendly host who was always available. Excellent pool. We will be back! Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Anne September 2019 Dimitrios was very patient and friendly to wait for us  our plane was more than 4 hours late which made us arrive after midnight. The residence is located next to pretty beaches   good restaurants   Pélekas is a pleasant city and it is very well located for visiting the whole island . On the other hand  we found our apartment poorly soundproofed  at the back of the residence with a not terrific view  and especially the feeling of having noisy neighbors who hung out the furniture every night and morning  which was not great for trying to sleep. I recommend requesting an apartment located on the 1st floor to avoid its nuisance. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Γιάννης August 2019 Great place! Translated from Greek  Show original
13245126,Lamprini August 2019 THE IMAGE OF THE POOL DOES NOT REFLECT THE REALITY  THE STRUCTURE THAT APPEARS TO BE NEIGHBORING. THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US ON A DIFFERENT SPOT THAN THE ONE IN THE PHOTO. BUILDING IS ABANDONED  ABANDONED  WITH VERY DIRTY YELLOW POOL  ISOLATED  IN THE ENTRYWAY HAS TOO OLD STRUCTURE WITH BROKEN SHUTTERS. IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR FAMILIES AND NOT SAFE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES  WE IMMEDIATELY CHECKED OUT AND THE LANDLORD PAID US ALL BACK IMMEDIATELY. VERY COOPERATIVE BUT WE HAVE ENJOYED A GREAT DEAL OF ACCOMMODATION IN AUGUST. Translated from Greek  Show original
13245126,Susanne July 2019 Very good place to relax. From this location you can easily reach the Pelekas village and the nearby beaches. It's best to rent a car ! The apartment is very clean and my pool a real plus. Dimitrios is very attentive to his hosts. To be repeated. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Marielle July 2019 One more positive review for Dimitris. The accommodation is very clean  ideally located  the location is peaceful and close to Pelekas beach which is great! Dimitris can be reached at any time and takes great care for his tenants. The pool is a real plus. Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Anna June 2019 Perfect stay  well-equipped house  beautiful view  relaxation and nice pool. Perhaps the only thing is parking under the house is a little uncomfortable and at risk of touching the car ; there is still parking along the street convenient and not far away. There are mosquitoes but the house is equipped with mosquito nets and stoves . With Dimitrios we only saw each other for check in  which was very fast despite our flight delay. She was always very helpful and kind on the phone. He arranged for us to rent a car perfectly and we had no problems. I wish I could go back ! Translated from Italian  Show original
13245126,Antoine June 2019 Great location with a pool. 15 min from Corfu old town and not too far from the beaches. Clean and nice accommodation. What a great stay Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Екатерина May 2019 Dimitrios's apartment is a wonderful place with a wonderful host. He contacted us in advance  answered questions  met us despite our late arrival. As a gift  we received wine and sweets - we had a birthday and wedding anniversary.  The place is as described. It was just me and my husband. In general  the apartment is designed for 4  but in my opinion  it is more comfortable for two. The kitchen had all the necessary utensils  as well as spices  oil  coffee  water in bottles. The washing machine worked without any problems. Clean linen  disposable slippers  towels. As well as sunbeds by the pool.  The balconies have a beautiful view of the island. You can see the greenery  the city  and the sea. The pool is clean  Dimitrios has its own sunbeds for guests.  The only downside was we were cold for a long time. First of all  because of the weather. It rained and it was windy. We turned on both the air conditioner and the heater. It still got cold. The floor is stone. Just in case  take warm slippers.  Overall  we are very satisfied with our stay and communication with Dimitrios. He loves and cares about his guests. I would recommend this apartment. Show more Translated from Russian  Show original
13245126,Heike April 2019 We enjoyed staying in the small apartment from the extremely friendly and helpful host Dimitris. For example  we asked for a coffee maker...the next morning there was one at the door early. We have arranged with the large single duvet. The location of the apartment is strategically located. You can walk to Pelikas  park well and get easily by car from there to other destinations. The value for money is good. Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Chloe September 2018 We had a great week  the apartment is very well located  25 minutes from the center of Corfu and the airport  largely comfortable for 4 people  the pool is the big plus after a day of sightseeing  everything is functional in the apartment  and Dimitrios takes care of small touches  we recommend this great host and this great place! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Chloé August 2018 My boyfriend and I had a lovely vacation at Dimitrios! The place was very clean  very pretty and the pool beautiful with a great view. The apartment is very well located as near the charming village of Pelekas as well as a few kilometers from Corfu Town. It also has a very good location to access different parts of the island without having to travel too many miles. Dimitrios is a great host  available  responsive  concerned about the smooth running of the trip and very friendly. Thanks again! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Melitta July 2018 The apartment superbly tastefully furnished  the amenities everything available  the location a dream...

We will definitely come back :-) Translated from German  Show original
13245126,Imkea May 2018 This apartment complex is located on the road to Pelekas  a short half hour walk from the bakery in the village. We were there with our 2 children who slept on the sofa bed. The space may not be very spacious  but it's fine  especially because you're outside a lot. The apartment has 2 small balconies  we had moved 2 chairs so that the four of us had breakfast on one balcony in the morning. From Pelekas you can go anywhere to explore the island. Dimitrios is very nice and will be there for you if you need him. Translated from Dutch  Show original
13245126,Pascal April 2018 Dimitrios takes care of 100% of its guests  welcome at all hours  immediate answer for any question... The accommodation is impeccable and matches the photos: superb view of the pool (even more grand a 5-minute drive from Kaiser's trone)  quiet and spacious; 2 minutes from a nice village  Pelekas  with good restaurants; 10 minutes from Glyfada  one of the beautiful beaches of the island and 1/4 hour from the capital. Only regret  that the terraces are a little small to eat for 4  and that there are not 4 chairs by the pool to be able to eat there while enjoying the view! Translated from French  Show original
13245126,Μιλτιάδης-Κωνσταντίνος August 2017 Very nice little house and very convenient! quite close to the city of Cyprus but also to nice beaches. Both Demetri and his parents are very accommodating! Frequently contacted and helped with everything we needed! Translated from Greek  Show original

9599653,Claire September 2022 First visit to Corfu and we have had a great time  truly relaxing. Agios Ioannis is so charming and the family owned Taverna in the village square welcoming. The gardens here are stunning and the pool simply perfect. Highly recommended!
9599653,Michelle September 2022 Villa Theodora is a lovely Villa in a quiet rural location. Fantastic swimming pool and outdoor area. A car is recommended.
9599653,Mark August 2022 This house is fantastic  the photos on the listing do not do it justice. It is light  spacious  airy  well furnished and stocked. The garden is lovely the pool is perfect - it also has a shallow end that 2 year olds can stand up in. All the bedrooms were spacious. The area is fairly quiet  but there is taverna in walking distance and in 2 minute drive you have a supermarket  bakery  restaurants - and Aqualand. This is probably the best house I have stayed in and I have stayed in a lot all over the world! Can not recommend enough for a peaceful  comfortable  tranquil getaway Peter is nearby  on hand and very eager to make sure everything is ok. 10 out 10.
9599653,Ann-Marie August 2022 Stayed for a week in this lovely villa that sits on the edge of a quiet village. Peter was a great host who gave us a warm welcome and thoughtfully provided some essential foods to get us set up. Plenty of clean linen and towels. It is spacious and cool and the pool was thoroughly enjoyed by us all! We were two adults and three kids under age 11. This is a good base to access Glyfada beach  Pelekas (beautiful views) Corfu Old Town and Aqualand. I recommend hiring a car to get around  which Peter helpfully arranged for us in advance. Good local taverna and food shop nearby. We enjoyed our stay!
9599653,Carol-Anne May 2022 This beautiful villa is only recommended. It was even nicer than in the pictures. The house  the garden and the pool are very well maintained  everything was very clean. When we arrived there were already a few things to eat and drink. Peter is a great host! He was very helpful right from the start  gave us lots of tips for the island. Gladly again☺
9599653,Benedicte April 2022 We had a really lovely time at Villa Theodora. The house is spacious and comfortable with a really lovely garden  and a great location: just off a main road that takes you to some of the best places on the island  and just 15 minutes from the airport. Peter welcomed us even though we arrived late  had bought some food for our breakfast  and replied to all our queries very quickly and helpfully. I highly recommend Peter's house to anyone wanting a home from home on Corfu.
9599653,Irena April 2022 Peter absolutely deserves the “superhost” title. He is very kind  friendly  responsive and helped us with every request or question we had. The photos of the villa are very accurate. It’s very beautiful and spacious  the garden is big and full of green trees and plants. We had 2 dogs and they definitely appreciated this outside area. Near the villa (3mins walk) is Costa’s taverna where they cook very nice and fresh Greek meals and you’ll also get to know about the history of this village if you ask the lady who works there. We loved every second of our stay and we’ll definitely come back. Peter was so nice that he even helped us with a lost ID card and he will send it to us via post. Thanks Peter!
9599653,Omar October 2021 It was amazing. From the start right till the end. Great communication  great villa and quite convenient located. The villa was superb and well equipped. Peter was always available should we need it something and quite accommodating as our flights were delayed because of the weather. If I come back to Corfu I’ll deffo look into booking again!
9599653,Jan October 2021 It was a beautiful stay at Peter‘s house. The swimming area is very nice specially when the sun is kicking (: Also the communication between us and Peter was always on point and he got some useful tips for us (beaches  scooter rental  etc.) We are lloking forward to come again. best theresa and jan
9599653,Mathilde August 2021 Great location to visit the island. Great pool and beautiful garden. Few steps away from the picturesque central place of the old village  with a wonderful traditional taverna. Other than that  few eating and shopping options nearby  a car is definitely needed.
9599653,David July 2021 Very nice and pleasant villa to stay. The village is well located to explore the north of the island. Excepted the Aqualand park which is out of the village  it’s an authentic place  with a local taverna far from the mass of the tourists. We love it and it’s nearly 15 minutes from the center of Kerkyra. Peter is a great host  he gave us very good advices and was present during our stay to communicate with us. We strongly recommend to stay here
9599653,Paul June 2021 Absolutely outstanding! Perfect place to stay if you have a rental car and want to experience the different beaches! We stayed three nights with our four kids (6 total). Day 1 we went to Paleokastritsa and Glyfada beaches. Day two we drove to Sidari and went to Canal d'Amour  Sidari Beach  Peroulades  and Porto Timoni. On day three we went to Dassia and visited Corfu Town. Unfortunately  Aqualand was not open. The location of the house was perfect for all events.  House: Patio and pool were the perfect way to start and end end days. We ate dinner on the patio  and the kids loved it. Kitchen has a large refrigerator and a washing machine which enabled us to pack lightly. The bedrooms were awesome -- very comfortable beds  air conditioning units  and blackout shutters that kept the rooms very dark. Very clean throughout and all modern amenities.  Host: The best Airbnb host we have had! Check and and out were very smooth  communication was outstanding through WhatsApp  and he had tremendous recommendations for the area. He arranged for a rental car for us to be brought to the house (and dropped off at the airport). Also: Peter speaks perfect English  which is extremely helpful.  Please note: on Corfu you MUST have your international drivers license with you in order to rent a car. I've rented cars in a lot of places  this is the first one that required the document to be in your possession.  Location: Beautiful view!!! In a small village with an easy walk to a bakery in the morning  outstanding restaurants for dinner  and a grocery store anytime. We didn't visit  but there is also winery very close by. Perfect for Aqualand -- five minute drive away.  Value: Outstanding! Well worth the price.  Overall: I'd give Peter 6 stars if I could! We would definitely rent again  and we cannot recommend this any higher for your vacation to Corfu. Show more
9599653,Tanguy June 2021 We had a great time at the Villa Theodora and Kostas was a great host providing with all the help so we could enjoy our stay in the house and on the island. The house is very well located  not too far from Corfu and close enough to beautiful beaches. We could also spend a full day in the house just to relax and enjoy the pool. Kostas was kind enough to check on us and help us with what we needed  being very quick to come back to us with our requests. We highly recommend the place.

9599653,Colin August 2020 A gorgeous Villa in an ideal location to explore the whole Island. The whole family enjoyed the villa  from the sizeable pool to al fresco dining on the terrace. The stay was further enhanced by the friendliness of the host Peter and all his help with local tips from best beaches  tavernas and boat hire. Also the Hospitality from Lula in the local Taverna  Costas  We would highly recommend a stay at this villa and if we return to corfu we will be back.
9599653,Francesca August 2020 My friends and I stayed here for a week and had the most amazing time. The villa was much more spacious and beautiful than the pictures suggested  well worth the money! Location was convenient as not far from the airport  Corfu town and the amazing Glyfada beach  however a car would be recommended as taxi’s add up. Peter was an amazing host helping us with our itinerary (boat trip  beaches  clubbing- whatever you want!)  rental cars  taxis and replied quickly. The village is really authentic and everyone we met was so friendly. We would definitely return.
9599653,Alberto June 2019 We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Theodora. It was perfect for our holidays on Corfu given its location not far from Kerkyra/Corfu Town which also allowed us to explore several places and beaches all around the island. Besides we loved the swimming pool! The communication was easy and quick and the hosts were always easily reachable. We are also thankful that they were so flexible with our arrival and departure time. We only have positive words about this stay!
9599653,Louise October 2018 My husband and I stayed at Peter's apartment and had a wonderful time. It was spacious and immaculately clean. The outside space and pool were beautiful and the location was nice and quiet so very good for relaxin  but still only a 15 minute drive away from Corfu town or a pretty village nearby called Pelekas. Peter was very helpful and quick to respond to messages. We would definitely stay again! Thank you!
9599653,Henna June 2018 Nice and restful spot  both children and adults enjoyed the pool! Hosts were very helpful and everything went smoothly. Worth a recommendation!
9599653,Charlotte May 2018 A wonderful place to stay really had a great time thank you very much.
9599653,Sebastian July 2017 Kostas is a great host who endeavours really hard to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. He was quick to respond to all questions and offered sound advice on arrival and throughout our stay. He ensured the pool was clean and the bedlinen was changed. He was really friendly and we all wanted to make sure this review was published to encourage more AirBnBers to consider this as an amazing place to stay!
9599653,Udo May 2022 We enjoyed it very much. The only criticism point is the street in the valley opposite  which you can hear relatively loud in the evening. However  this would not stop us from visiting the house again. For questions of any kind  Peter was always available. Translated from German  Show original
9599653,Nadine August 2021 Peter is a professional host  always available and attentive. Translated from French  Show original
9599653,Юлия June 2018 We were met by Peter  a very charming and sweet host! He met us near the water park and escorted us to the house! The house is a five-minute walk from the water park. The location of the house is very convenient in that you can get to any central part of the island equally quickly! We picked up our car at the airport and moved around the island freely. The house was as we expected  the back terrace of the house has a lovely garden and a chic pool! The water in the pool is clean and warm  the kids spent all their free time there! Peter was very responsive  helpful in a difficult situation   in which I really appreciate your help! Thank you and see you soon)))!!! Translated from Russian  Show original
