Panorama Sidari,10,We almost don’t want to give a great review as we want to keep this gem of a hotel to ourselves.  The staff work tirelessly to look after every guest and are happy and welcoming and very helpful. As we arrived at around 2am  we were provided with a light snack ready and waiting for us in our fridge in our room which I felt was a really thoughtful touch. Everywhere was spotless and the grounds were excellently maintained.  The food was of a very high quality with plenty of variety every day. Dining room staff were attentive and prompt at removing used plates etc from the table.  Rooms are set out in apartment blocks on the hill side. The walk up is quite steep (ours was the very top) but the hotel provide rides up to the top on a golf cart which runs approx every 5 minutes and is a real leg saver!  our room was cleaned very thoroughly every day (except Sunday) by a lovely lady called Efi. Beds were changed every other day  but new towels daily.,I struggle to think of anything. Perhaps maybe I’d have been tempted into the beautiful pool if it had been heated. However  as we chose to visit in early October  it’s not a surprise that it was cold and I’m sure during the height of the summer it’s very warm.,Michelle,United Kingdom,October 2022
Panorama Sidari,7.0,Size of the room is very nice  our room was huge with two levels .

No drinking water in the fridge and no tea or coffee  No roof on the balcony /when it’s raining all water stay on the balcony and it’s not possible to open balcony doors because water come inside .  Beds could be more comfortable  food was delicious people was very happy with food but cold be some more options for vegans,Patrycjusz,United Kingdom,September 2022

Panorama Sidari,8.0,The food was excellent. Many varieties  for everyone's taste. Simply brilliant! All inclusive is really well improved! At the pool bar you can serve several drinks and snacks. Thumbs up for the woman with the pancakes and the others collegues. I really appreciated the service with beach towels. You can take everyday clean towels with 10 euro and after you return it you have your money back (literally  they are free).  I also sugest that a laundry service would be very helpfull.,The size of our room was good but it could be better  it is a little bit old. The bathroom also with aspects of oldness. Also  the buildings with rooms are placed upwards  in the back of hotel and you have to walk on yourself sometimes.,Marian,Romania,August 2022

Panorama Sidari,8.0,Staff were so friendly  all of them. Great view from balcony. Large pool and very clean. Good range of food options at every meal. The buggy system was great as some of our family had/have mobility issues. Main resort a short walk away  as was the beach.,The entertainment staff tried hard but some of the evening shows were pretty poor (though some (fire show  magic show) were excellent so a mixed bag. Beer seemed very weak  you could tell the difference when you had a beer down in the resort.,Rob,United Kingdom,August 2022
Panorama Sidari,8.0,amazing staff. excellent food. very big pool,our room needed refurbishment some had been done the the pool was not cleaned properly any white or light costumes/shorts went yellow. a bit of a trek to the resort. the bathroom flooded at every use,Sue,United Kingdom,August 2022
Panorama Sidari,9.0,The staff was excellent  the food was amazing  the pool was very nice with many sunbeds. We had a small issue with the toilet from the bathroom but the receptionist changed our room by giving us one much better.,I cannot say that was something that I didn't like  but I think that needs to be improved the furniture in the room  specially the beds.,Simona,Romania,August 2022
Panorama Sidari,7.0,The food  Staff & entertainment were good.,We got a room right at the top of the hill which had damp up the walls. They also advertise all rooms as sea view. we got 90% overgrown hedges & 10% sea view. after complaining about the damp & my bad chest the second time they moved us room though. again at the top of the hill  The room was nice & had a comfy bed. But again I don’t know how they can advertise the rooms at the top as sea view. Our friends had a room in the next block down though with a lovely view.,Jamie,United Kingdom,August 2022

Panorama Sidari,9.0,The hotel is really big with a lot of blocks on the territory  our block was up on the hill  but we didn’t have to worry much  because there is a golf driver ready to give you a ride.  The staff is great  very nice people  when we had questions or issues  the staff was very quick to help. Animators was the most cheerful and energetic people ever!  Talking about the food  Mama Mia  I miss it already  every day the restaurant offers you different meals and each day is special cuisine day! I enjoyed Greek and Mexican cuisine days the most.  The view from our room was incredible  even better than the photos we saw on Booking and I am also adding photos to this.,Would be nice if there was «do not disturb board» because if you are in your room when the cleaning lady comes  she opens the door herself. Also  one time we didn’t have any room service for 3 days and after that nobody changed the towels for us :(,Iryna,Latvia,July 2022

Panorama Sidari,8.0,The view  the food  the pool.,The bed's mattresses were rather hard (could feel the springs). New ones are a must for some rooms. (I think not all rooms have these old ones) The fact that we could not refill water bottles (maybe due to covid reasons) we could take cups of water in the room though so it was fine...,Michael,United Kingdom,June 2022

Panorama Sidari,7.0,- kind  helpful and hardworking staff - really tasty and delicious dishes (although breakfast are orientated to the english customers)  - program created by animators - guys who ride a golfcar,- ancient room and bathroom that needs urgently a reconstruction (we did not expect it for the 3 stars hotel)  - creaky bed with a broken leg - ancient furniture with ancient smell - not enough space in wardrobe - bedsheets were not changed after 2 days (like promised),Tom,Slovakia,September 2021
Panorama Sidari,7.0,The staff was nice. Nicolas and Eva provided amazing service. The food is avarage but enough. The place itself is at good location but climbing up every day to reach our room was annoying.,Our room was huge with no furniture. I really missed a mosquito net for the windows and a clothes rack. We bought it in the market to be able to hang our clothes outside. The balcony had a forest view what is annoying considering that all the other rooms had sea view. The room was dirty and old. They promised every day cleaning but didn't clean every day. The bed was wet every dry. I say for this price it was okay as we didn't spent too much time in the room. The bar at the pool offers horrible coctails. Better not include those in the all inclusive and offer a discount for better quality.,Nelli,Hungary,August 2021

Panorama Sidari,8.0,Animation team always engaged with the guests for games and entertainment which was great. We went in August for 10nights and every single day was between 35 to 40 degrees but even in the scourging heat  the animation team still carried on with regular schedule under the blazing sun. Not every resort's Animation team puts in that extra effort so hats off to Ivats and his team. Bar staff were great and full of smiles always. Food & Beverage manager was exceptional!,Only negative thing I could say about Panorama Sidari is that the alcoholic spirits werent the best.

Panorama Sidari,5.0,Good location close to the beach. Price was ok for what we got.,All drinks served in small flimsy plastic cups - finished them in two mouthfuls. Food not very good eg. All fruit was from can  inedible pastries  no yoghurt. Room was run down. Noisy air conditioning. Mattresses were hard  only given one small pillow each and one thin blanket. Concierge very snarky when booking covid tests and taxi for the next day - said there was only one clinic in Town and we had left it to the last minute but we found multiple other walk in clinics on our own. Sign on toilet saying not to flush toilet paper - well if you’re doing number 2 then what else are you going to do? Leave smelly toilet paper in the bin?,Maisie,United Kingdom,August 2021

Panorama Sidari,7.0,Os quartos são espaçosos e a vista soberba. No entanto  os colchões são maus (com molas salientes) e o mobiliário do quarto bastante desgastado). As comidas são boas  como portuguesa que sou  senti falta de mais variedade de carnes / peixes. Saladas e sobremesas bastante boas. A distância da praia não é grande  faz-se bem a pé. Um ponto positivo que achei interessante foi o facto de haver motoristas com carros elétricos a levar as pessoas até aos seus quartos. Uma parte negativa foi o facto dos funcionários do restaurante estarem constantemente à procura de loiça para levantar!! Fez-me sentir pressionada durante todas as refeições! E o facto de ainda tirarem os pratos enquanto estamos a mastigar.... Mal. Na minha cultura isso é falta de educação. Mas acredito que não o façam por mal.... Resumindo  voltava para ficar poucas noites pela relação preço/qualidade e localização. Ah  tenho de referir que a piscina era boa  quente e grande!!!,,Jessica,Portugal,July 2022

Lo staff del ristorante è gentilissimo e attento ad ogni richiesta  premuroso ed efficiente così come il manager.,,Patrizia,Switzerland,June 2022

Panorama Sidari,9.0,Przepiękne widoki z pokoju  nazwa hotelu idealnie odzwierciedla stan faktyczny :) podwójne drzwi balkonowe zasłaniające 100% promieni słonecznych (trochę gorzej z wygluszaniem dźwięków) pozwoliły na długi  spokojny sen. Przemili i pomocni ludzie z obsługi - na recepcji  w restauracji  przy barze  w serwisie sprzątającym i kierowcy melexów! Zero wyjątków! Wszędzie witano nas uśmiechem i czuliśmy się niemal jak w domu. Przyjemny  nienachalny  choć powtarzalny program animacji dla dzieci i dorosłych  prowadzony fantastyczny team animatorów (pozdrawiamy ekipę Forever Fun - Ivatsa  Veronikę  Nedko i Martina!). Co wieczór inny temat animacji  raz był quiz muzyczny  innego dnia wieczór grecki itd. Lunche i kolacje różnorodne  bardzo dobre  każdy z pewnością znajdzie coś dla siebie. Bardzo smaczne drinki na barze  spory wybór i nie żałowano alkoholu! :D  Czysty  dość głęboki basen  tylko mógłby być nieco większy.,,Dorota,Poland,August 2021

Panorama Sidari,6.0,Cordiali e disponibili  la pulizia è buona il tutti i locali  la parte del ristorante  la hall  la reception e la zona piscina è tutta in stile moderno quindi credo  e spero  che siano in fase di crescita anche con le stanze. La pecca è una ripida salita che separa l' ingresso dalle camere ma hanno messo a disposizione una macchina elettrica e un autista che sale e scende quando viene chiamato dai clienti. Ottimo il buffet  la colazione è varia ma non ho mai avuto bisogno di richiedere prodotti senza glutine o lattosio o altro ma conoscendo lo staff credo che avrebbero provveduto senza problemi. Pranzo e cena vari e abbondanti  per noi Italiani è complicato trovare una buona cucina all' estero ma devo dire che qui non abbiamo avuto problemi  noi ci adattiamo molto alla cucina locale ma essendo molto speziata  se non ci andava un piatto  avevamo una vasta scelta su tutto il resto. il personale in sala è molto attento ad esserci quando deve  ripeto la pulizia e il decoro. Possibilità di Lunch o Dinner box se non si rientra in tempo per il pasto. Ottimo! Tutto!,,Denise,Italy,September 2022

Sugar and Almonds,10,wonderful apartments- clean and stylish. great location.,nothing,Isabelle,United Kingdom,July 2022
Sugar and Almonds,10,Met on our arrival by our host Pepi. She is a lovely lady and nothing is too much trouble for her. She is very proud of her apartments and it’s shows as they are immaculate! The lady that cleans the apartments works extremely hard and it was lovely to come back deer a day out to fresh towels and bedding. The property was modern  spacious and very comfortable . We had 4 balconies with ample seating space. if you wanted to cook there was everything available in the open plan kitchen. excellent aircon  fly screens . Beautiful sunsets every night from the balcony. within walking distance of thee wonderful beach  tavernas and supermarkets.  Will return,one small gripe if using the shower over the bath it tended to flood the floor. This was the only thing I could think of as everything else was amazing.,Lisa,United Kingdom,June 2022
Sugar and Almonds,8.0,Location was good. Peace and quiet was good  lovely to hear the sea in the night. TV and wifi were good. Apartment was very attractive. Pepi was very helpful.,We are avid readers so we felt more reading lamps would have been a benefit. A medium size saucepan would have been good  there was only one smallish one and one huge one. Though there was lots of crockery  glassware  good sharp knives.,Barbara,United Kingdom,October 2021
Sugar and Almonds,10,We really loved our stay at Sugar and Almond. Our flight was really delayed and we arrived very late at night but Pepi was right there to welcome us. She responded very quickly to any questions we had during booking  after our arrival and during our stay. Our apartment (biscoto) was on the upper floor. We were welcomed with a lovely fruit basket and a bottle of wine. The apartment was new  modern  really spacious and very clean. All the rooms including the two bedrooms had the sea view and sizable terraces in front. The decor was neutral and tasteful. We really liked additional little balconies off the kitchen and next to the bathroom where we could dry our beach towels on the provided rack. That way the front terraces were free of our beach stuff. The apartment was nicely furnished and the kitchen well equipped. There was a plenty of built-ins to store our things comfortably. There was a cleaning service daily by a lovely lady for whom nothing was a problem. We loved the close proximity to the beach and the beautiful sunsets in peaceful surroundings. Agios Stefanos is a quiet town with plenty of restaurant options  bakeries and a few grocery stores  one being a short walk from the property. We really loved Manthos Restaurant and the Waves Taverna on the beach. The apartment was beautiful and I do not think the pictures do it justice. Thank you Pepi for hosting us and for a beautiful parting gift.,,Gosha,United States,August 2021
Sugar and Almonds,9.0,Great location. Stunning view. Everything you need and really clean. Great air conditioning. 2 minutes walk to the supermarket  3 minutes from beach and lots of fabulous restaurants and bars also within a few minutes walk. This is our second stay here and we’ll definitely be back.,,Debbie,United Kingdom,August 2021

Sugar and Almonds,10,The apartment is in a perfect location  about 1 minute walk from the beach and stunning views of the sea from every front facing room and balcony. The apartment is modern  spacious  well equipped and spotlessly clean. Communication from Pepi was excellent and she was very friendly and helpful on arrival. Can't recommend this place enough!,Nothing.,Andy,United Kingdom,September 2020
Sugar and Almonds,10,Great apartment  so spacious  ideal location  we loved it. The owners were great communicators and made us very welcome.,Balcony isn't very private at the price  there are 4 apartments as part of the place  if you're on the ground floor you'll be passed by everyone else as they come in. All very friendly but worth knowing.,Anonymous,Tanzania,August 2021
Sugar and Almonds,8.0,"Die Gastgeberin Pepi war sehr freundlich. 2 Flaschen Wasser waren vorhanden. Die Abholung vom Flughafen hat suoer geklappt. Der Blick vom Balkon war sehr schön. (Sonnenuntergangsseite) Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet. Ein Supermarkt ist 100 Meter entfernt. Es gibt viele Restaurants in der Nähe. Das Restaurant ""Waves"" können wir empfehlen.

Sugar and Almonds,9.0,Die Lage des Hauses ist perfekt! Man läuft nur wenige Minuten runter zum Strand  sowie zum Supermarkt und Restaurants. In der Wohnung weht eine angenehme Meeresbrise und nachts hört man natürlich das Meeresrauschen. Die Wohnung ist riesig und hat eine tolle Ausstattung  sodass man auch mal was kochen kann. An allen Türen und Fenstern sind Fliegengitter  die man auch braucht. Einfach jedes Zimmer hat einen Balkon! Abends hat man perfekten Blick auf den wunderschönen Sonnenuntergang über dem Meer. Auch die Agios Stefanos Bucht ist traumhaft mit dem tollen langen Sandstrand. Fast jeden Tag kommt eine Reinigungskraft  was wir aber nicht unbedingt benötigt hätten. Noch ein großer Bonus: Unten in der Garage ist alles voller Strandausstattung für die ganze Familie von Luftmatratzen über Sandspielzeug und Schnorcheln  alles dabei.,,Mialein,Germany,June 2022
