"November 3, 2022",1.0,A complete waste of time!,"A complete comercial experience. 15 years ago you could enjoy the house. Today there are hundreds of people crawling around, the best parts kept for gold tickets. One mainly sees two floors and the rest is a huge staircase up to the roof and down again to the basement. Two gift stores and one café in the middle of the visit. Horrible experience. Better to look at pictures in a book!"
"November 2, 2022",5.0,Guadi's amazing Casa Batilo,It is an amazing structure from the fecund mind of Antonio Gaudi. Many creative features. It is a must see when traveling to Barcelona.
"November 2, 2022",5.0,One not to miss!! A must see for any visitors!,"Excellent visit to Gaudi’s Casa Batllo - incredible building. What a talented man ! Excellent audio tour great commentary giving background to the building and individual rooms. We enjoyed a drink on the rooftop terrace to relax. Expect to be there for a good couple of hours as lots to take in. Just when we thought it was over, we were ushered into an audio visual room which was awesome 😎 thoroughly recommend for all ages!"
"November 1, 2022",4.0,Casa Battlo,"Loved the interactive tablet. Brought the rooms to life!!
Innovative design and engineering ahead of his time."
"October 31, 2022",5.0,Historic Building - wish I could live there,One of Gaudi's finest creations. It still looks as beautiful as when it was built. Definitely worth visiting both inside and out.
"October 31, 2022",3.0,Interesting to Walk By,It's a busy street and lots of crowds. We had seen the Casa Millo (La Pedrera) which is larger and likely his best apartment work before starting the Sagrada Familia. Worth walking passed and seeing the competitive architectural structures on the same block.
"October 31, 2022",5.0,Don't miss this!,We did the nighttime experience. An amazing way to view the structure. And the rooftop concert was super.
"October 31, 2022",3.0,"Interesting, but weird and WAY too crowded.",Way too crowded. We were barely able to move because of all the people. Very strange building. Much of the tour was off-putting due to the weird nature of what we were seeing. The owners retreat was the best part of the tour.
"October 30, 2022",4.0,Astounding architecture,"This was the last Gaudi building we visited out of our four, and was absolutely amazing architecturally. It was the only one we didn't tour, but the line was long and we happened upon it. However, just looking at the front of it made my day...such a beautiful building. Next time, I'll have to tour."
"October 30, 2022",3.0,Beautiful and amazing structure with dangerous and unhealthy crowd levels.,"The house was dangerously crowded. The lines inside moved slowly throughout the house. If there were to be an emergency, there would have been a very dangerous situation."
"October 29, 2022",2.0,$,"Don't get me wrong. Gaudi has been one of the world's greatest architects. His works, and revolutionary ideas and expressions are remarkable. I rated poor simply because of the price. Wonderful to see, but even Sagrada Familia was cheaper, and each ticket sale goes to build and participate in its construction. Yet this was more expensive. I didn't find it worth it."
"October 29, 2022",4.0,Good show great site,We want to a show here and it was avery good experience. The audio guide is great. The limitation of the number if people really helped. I would do it again.
"October 29, 2022",3.0,Interesting facade but underwhelming interior,"The facade/exterior of the building is beautiful which incidentally is completely free since you can just take pictures by the street. The tour inside feels overly commercialised and honestly there isn't that much to see. If you're in a rush and are choosing between different attractions in and near Barcelona, i'd recommend skipping this."
"October 28, 2022",5.0,Very good,A bit pricy especially golden tour but worth it. You are in another world in Gaudi’s head. It is very interesting
"October 27, 2022",3.0,Stunning building with visiting flaws,"Seeing this Gaudi-designed building was a highlight of my trip to Barcelona. It was more impressive in design, to me, than La Perdrera, which is just a few blocks away. The tickets are pricey; I opted for the ""Gold"" entry, which charges more to be able to skip the entry line, and also see a couple of more rooms than on the standard tour. The self-guided tour is done on a tablet, and very well explains and shows the history, design, and family use of this beautiful building. There are virtual depictions of the original family and their furnishings. My primary criticism is that they are packing this building to the gills. Although entry tickets are timed, they are selling too many tickets for the available time slots. They've turned it into a Gaudi theme park. My time was 4:15 pm on a weekday. The crowds inside this building of small rooms, many hallways, and narrow staircases, are not just off-putting, they seem unsafe in this era. The ventilation is poor, and even on a day with moderate outdoor temperature, the interior of this building was so hot and stuffy that I wondered if I might pass out. Not kidding. I can't imagine visiting in summer. Additionally, there are many many many stairs to climb, and no seating, which in my opinion makes it difficult, if not impossible, to allow seniors, physically-challenged people, or children (of which there were many) to have a comfortable visit.
I was thrilled to visit this building, and by the end, I was desperately eager to leave it."
"October 27, 2022",2.0,Give it a miss!,We hated every minute of this visit! It was the one place in Barcelona I’d never visit again and would tell others to avoid! We couldn’t actually enjoy it or take it in as we were shuffled around nose to tail of hundreds of other people! The 3D tablets add to the mayhem and people stop on stairs and in narrow doors and no one can move. A VERY unpleasant experience. See it from the outside as the building is just an empty shell anyway (apart from 2 gift shops you can’t avoid!)
"October 27, 2022",4.0,Worth visiting,"A ""do not miss"" if one is interested in Gaudi. Was crowded however. We did with a private guide so definitely had lots of background and detail about the home that we probably would have missed."
"October 27, 2022",4.0,Spectacular but crowded,"The house and Gaudi's work within it, were spectacular. Despite my early start it was still too crowded. Every point of interest was jammed with folk listening to the audio and rarely holding awareness of those around trying to see. Next time I would do without audio. I ended up ignoring the stops and finding a quiet roof top space to catch up later."
"October 27, 2022",4.0,"A gem, but not easy to visit","This house’s Gaudí interior is stunning. I found it more beautiful and compelling than the perhaps more famous La Perdrera. My main and strong criticism is that too many tickets are being sold for the same time slots, leading to overcrowding in narrow spaces and physical discomfort, which strongly impacts the enjoyment of the visit. At moments it seemed more like a Gaudí theme park, rather than an artistic experience.
Be aware that there are many many narrow staircases to climb, and no place to sit and enjoy the house. Also, while the outdoor temperature was moderate (mid 70’s F), inside the house was extremely warm and stuffy, because of the crowding. It’s not a good place imo, to bring kids.
Tickets are expensive, I opted for the Gold entry, which allows much faster entry, and seeing one or two rooms not included in the standard tour. The audio guide, on a tablet with video as well, is very well done, including virtual re-creations of furnishings and family life.
I am very happy to have seen this, but it wasn’t an entirely pleasant experience."
"October 26, 2022",5.0,Not to be missed,Casa Batlló is just incredible. Gaudi was ahead of his time and the architecture is stunning. We opted for the gold package. When we arrived there was a huge queue but those with gold passes had their own queue and there was about 2 ahead of us (make sure you arrive at the right time) We went through an art installation and then on to get out headsets. We had headphones and iPads. The iPads were like VR and allowed you to see what the room was like if it was empty (handy as it was so busy and full of people). The gold passes also gave you access to a room of furniture (ideas for how the apartment could have been set up) at the end we were treated to an audio/visual experience. I would recommend this tour. Well worth the money.
"October 26, 2022",4.0,Interesting venue,Be prepared for large crowds. Difficult to photograph anything due to people everywhere. Video at the end could have been the highlight but I was refused entry because I was too late. No signs to tell me that I would be denied due to late arrival 🥲
"October 25, 2022",5.0,Skip the line tickets,This is a MASTERPIECE!! The materials and textiles used to create this mansion in the early 1900's is a must see in Barcelona. Buy the skip-the-line tickets! It was a BREEZE!!
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Amazing,A wonderful story being this Gaudi masterpiece ... get tickets on line or wait a long time to get in.
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Go for the blue ticket over the silver (unless you have kids),"A wonderful experience - a must see in Barcelona. The only tips I have are to buy your ticket online when you arrive, as it is quicker and cheaper than getting in the queue, and to go for the blue ticket rather than silver, as the Gaudi Dome and virtual reality tablet are probably not worth the extra ten Euro. Having said that, the virtual tablets are great for kids - lots of interesting features to each room, including lots of creatures!"
"October 24, 2022",5.0,Better than the Basilica,"The basicila is an awe inspiring intro to Gaudi's talents, but Casa Batllo was a showcase of multiple architectural styles that were each incredible! The audio tour is the way to visit. Definitely a ""must see""!"
"October 22, 2022",5.0,Gaudi interiors!,"Beautiful interiors and a lovely house if you want to see Gaudi at his best.
Go early and pre book your tickets as it gets very busy. Be prepared there are lots of stairs too."
"October 21, 2022",4.0,Better than expected,Visiting the house is a great experience! We were a bit disappointed of the magic night show on the roof top. The flamenco show was nice but nothing special. But the house is surprising!
"October 21, 2022",4.0,Only saw outside but Beautiful,"Part of a great walk through the Eixample area. We stood across the street and loved this Building.
Part of the Block of Discord."
"October 21, 2022",5.0,A Magical House,"For anyone debating which Gaudi property to see, Casa Batllo wins over Casa Mila by a landslide. If you can at least walk by at night you will see how magnificent this building is. We had the Gold tour with the night experience. If you can, JUST DO IT!"
"October 21, 2022",5.0,Great,"Great memory. A must see!
Very organized you receive the iPad and it has all the rooms listen on it to guide your walk step by step."
"October 21, 2022",5.0,Case Baltllo best Gaudi experience,This was worth the cost. There are three levels of packages and we took the cheapest and it still gave us everything for an amazing look at the genius of Antoni Gaudi
"October 20, 2022",5.0,Amazing experience,"Amazing experience. We did the silver option. This gave us headphones and a tablet which guided us around via numbers. The tablet was very informative and interacted within the rooms so show different objects and scenes otherwise unseen with the naked eye. Being silver it also gave us time in the immersive experience which was amazing. It does give a warning if your epileptic or claustrophobic before entering. Would highly recommend. A must see in Barcelona, only takes around an hour for the tour."
"October 20, 2022",5.0,Now I love Gaudi even more.,"This place is amazing. It's full of mind-bending architectural ideas that really shouldn't work, but they absolutely do. The overall effect is surprisingly modern - not bad for a building that's more than 100 years old. The audio tour was great... it was busy, but after seeing it, I understand why."
"October 20, 2022",5.0,Casa Batlo a must see,"A must see for Barcelona. Great information about the Gaudi’s thinking behind the design, and really interesting to see how he pushed the boundaries, and to see people lived in the house."
"October 19, 2022",5.0,Roof top bar to end the tour was great!,"Lovely experience, very informative audio tour, liked the gift shop and rooftop bar at the end of the tour. Not too crowded when we went at 3pm."
"October 19, 2022",5.0,Loved It!,"I loved touring this ""house"". The colors, the audio tour, the shapes -- fabulous! Also, they have the best gift shop I have ever seen in a museum type building."
"October 18, 2022",5.0,Gaudi perfection,This was my favorite of the many Gaudi buildings we visited on our trip to Barcelona. Whimsical and practical all together. The play of light and the wooden doors and widows help add to the mystique. If you can only visit one Gaudi creation this should be it (yes even more than Park Guell and the Sagrada).
"October 18, 2022",5.0,Awesome even if you don't love art,"We loved it here! An amazing experience, you don't have to be an art lover to love this. I myself am an art student and did a study about Gaudi, but my boyfriend is more of an art hater and we both loved the experience here. It is a wonderful combination of art, culture and history. We highly recommend getting your tickets online and taking the silver package. We loved the audio visual bit with the iPads recommend."
"October 18, 2022",5.0,Fascinating,"I loved it. The experience was fascinating. I could never have imagined that it was so psychedelic ❤️.
Don't miss the three minute movie ""inside Gaudis mind""!!"
"October 16, 2022",3.0,Expensive experience. Cost-benefit of paying for this is unsatisfying,"Unless you are really into architecture, this is a very expensive attraction. The Louvre, The Met and the Rijksmuseum all have lower prices and endless collections of art. I wouldn’t do it again."
"October 15, 2022",5.0,Beautiful Casa Batllo,"The house was beautiful and the audio guide was very informative. We had the gold pass with the immersive experience. The adults enjoyed the whole tour, but our kids (9 and 14) did not."
"October 14, 2022",5.0,Barcelona October 2022,Barcelona 2022. A great visit to this incredible Gaudi designed home. Not to be missed. Advance tickets work best. Enjoy
"October 13, 2022",3.0,A piece of genius,"If you have never been - you must visit at least once. The creative, colorful and fascinating house designed by Gaudi.
The only problem is the high entrance fee and the never-ending line of tourists who want to visit the place."
"October 12, 2022",5.0,Gaudi-designed private home on Passeig de Gracia,"Buy your tickets in advance for this Gaudi-designed masterpiece. It is very interesting to learn how a family actually lived in this incredible futuristic home. There are two levels of tickets, gold and silver, so if you are keen to see everything that is publicly available to tour, be sure to buy the gold level tickets."
"October 12, 2022",3.0,rip-off in Barcelona,The price (the most basic is around £40 and doesn't admit you to all the rooms) is a scam. I don't care if it is a UNESCO site. Only one of us went in because of this. Very crowded - try to go early to avoid the crush within the house. What a shame they set this ludicrous cost. And it is considerably more if you want to see the whole thing!!
"October 11, 2022",5.0,Gaudi's casa Batllo,"An experience! The doors , the rooftop, the balcony..
I wish I could have a balcony like this of Casa Batllo"
"October 11, 2022",4.0,Enjoyed……,"We enjoyed it! Inside the structure was lovely and the audio guide was sufficient. I must admit the outside is more over the top and has more wow factor than inside.

We didn’t regret going in, but at 35€ entrance if I were on a strict budget you get more bang for your buck and Gaudi at Sagrada Familia (26€-60€)"
"October 11, 2022",3.0,Gaudi has nice work but better tours exist for 35 Euro,"I enjoyed the architecture at the 945 AM - blue - self guided tour, beating the crowd, as well as the work the carpenters put into the wood work (doors). It's enjoyable but I think you could spend 35 euro on pinchos (pintxos) and tapas on Blai Street and have more fun without being overwhelmed with consumerism (gift shop). You'll enjoy the roof top and taking a picture in front of the house. Compared to Alcazar in Seville for 13.50 euro and Alhambra general admission for 14 euros in Granada; Both are more affordable and enjoyable! Barcelona has many places one can enjoy, don't be afraid to ask the locals where they go for a good time."
"October 10, 2022",3.0,Interesting design,We popped by after visiting the Sagrada and it looks interesting but we baulked a little at the price for entry. It does look fascinating and good to see modern art installations. Worth having a look.
"October 9, 2022",5.0,"NOT words, Perfect Treat with Cube experience.","Amazing no words, and I had very funny, a strange & special stories about this building. The cube experience is a total fun to an already excellent attraction."
"October 8, 2022",5.0,Totally stunning inside and out but book online & go early!,This was our favourite tour of everything we saw in Barcelona. House inside and outside was amazing and the interactive iPad audio guide really added to it. Not too sure about the other interactive rooms as didn’t quite go with Gaudi’s theme but hey ho. We went early (9.30am) and had booked online so had the house more or less to ourselves. Loved it and totally recommend it.
"October 8, 2022",3.0,Casa Batllo was just OK IMO.,"I would pass on this. It was super expensive like 35 Euro per ticket and the audio was just gushing weirdness. The house was like walking thru a Disney park adventure. After going to the Sagrada Familia, this was just a let down. I would just go to the Casa and take pictures of the outside."
"October 6, 2022",4.0,Wonderful tour with AI technology,It was a great tour with AI guide. Worth going to see. A lot of steps to climb up and down. My husband helped me but come prepared I didn’t check and we got the gold pass and that was little longer.
"October 5, 2022",5.0,Gaudi Adventure,The house was amazing. Gaudi did a fantastic job incorporating nature into his designs. Thus tour is worth every penny. We really enjoyed the extra two rooms. I strongly urge you to get the gold package.
"October 5, 2022",5.0,Gold pass a must,We loved being able to tour the entire house and even go up to the roof to get a bird's eye view of the city! Definitely worth paying for the Gold pass.
"October 4, 2022",4.0,Good experience,Good experience. Would recommend booking online for cheaper ticket. Was quite busy. Have a drink at the top and enjoy the views
"October 1, 2022",5.0,Another Gaudi Masterpiece,"My husband and I visited Casa Batllo on a whim after a friend of a friend had suggested visiting as it was her favourite landmark in Barcelona.

As it was only a short walk from our hotel, we thought we may as well.

We bought tickets online 15 minutes ahead of time. We treated ourselves to Gold tickets as we were able to jump the queue and there were a few added extras which included a tablet guided tour and a tour of the private residences of the Batllos. For the queue jump alone, I thought it was worth it.

Casa Batllo itself is very special. The architecture and design, by Gaudi, is so interesting and so beautiful. The explanations as you walk through the building via the audio tour were well explained and made it very enjoyable.

The building is just beautiful on the inside, just as it is on the outside, so I would definitely recommend visiting, especially if you're interested in the works of Antoni Gaudi."
"October 1, 2022",2.0,Too expensive,This is an interesting building but for what they charge you to visit a complete scam. Buy tour tickets in advance if you want to visit
"October 1, 2022",5.0,Spectacular house in the heart of Barcelona,This is truly an amazing house well worth the money and time to visit we used the interactive audio which just heightened the experience
"October 1, 2022",3.0,Overrated and overpriced.,"Worth seeing from the outside, but $40+ for a house and mediocre audio tour is crazy. Maybe worth seeing once in your life but don't make it a priority."
"October 1, 2022",5.0,Magical Gaudi,"This was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. I can’t overstate how amazing, magical and beautiful this house is. We splashed out on gold tickets and were so glad we did - not only did we skip the long queue, but we gained access to the whole house and had the added bonus of VR tablets with audio guide that really brought things to life. If you appreciate architecture and design then this is a must-see when visiting Barcelona."
"October 1, 2022",4.0,Gold ticket tour,It was VERY crowded so I recommend purchasing the Gold ticket which allows you to skip the long lines and gives you access to the private quarters as well as the roof and an audio guide which gives the history of the home. Well worth it but be warned that you will be walking up six flights of stairs. Definitely worth a visit. Stunning architecture and design.
"September 29, 2022",5.0,Amazing!!! You must go.,This was such an amazing experience. I am so glad we took this tour. You cannot fully appreciate the masterpiece of this house’s design and beauty until you go inside and see. The audio tour gives very helpful insight to learn more about Gaudi and his thought process and his design. I highly recommend this tour. I really loved this place and wish I could’ve had more time to spend (but we had another tour to get to). One of the highlights of my whole Spain trip.
"September 29, 2022",5.0,"A Singular, Beautiful, Piece of Archtecture","The tour of this home by Anton Gaudi was one of the most compelling experiences in my life. He was a remarkable artist, architect and engineer. We bought the gold ticket and were happy to have the entire home open to us to see. I highly recommend this for a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
"September 28, 2022",4.0,Great Tour,"Yes, with the lines it does feel a bit like a Disney experience. Winding your way through the home in a long line of tourists. That said, it is worth it.

I truly loved this tour. The house is beautiful and unlike anything you have ever seen. I have visited almost all of the Gaudi sites over the years so one could argue I didn't need to see another - I am so glad we did this tour.

Yes, the gold tickets are pricey, but I have no problem in recommending you book them. For me the audio was terrific and the interactive viewing was not as exciting, but I know many love that ability to see the room you are touring come to life with the magical creatures. The gold ticket grants access to extra rooms and the rooftop - for me the rooftop itself paid for that golden ticket."
"September 27, 2022",4.0,Impressive archetecture,"This places was at one time a private home designed by the area's top artist. No long lines like the church about 8 blocks away. Visit the roof, it is the most impressive part of the features."
"September 27, 2022",5.0,Impressive,"A truly amazing experience - we went for the early access, so enjoyed a rather quiet visit. The house is absolutely beautiful and superbly maintained, the audio/visual-guide excellent and visitor experience of really high quality. At 45 Euros the ticket wasn't cheap, but the experience made it feel money well spent."
"September 27, 2022",5.0,Best experience in Barcelona,"The best part of our trip to Barcelona was visiting Casa Batllo. I recommend buying the gold tickets, you get the VR tablets which really enhances the experience and you go in first plus you get to see Gaudi's private residence."
"September 26, 2022",5.0,"Amazing visit, book gold tickets!","We absolutely loved this place. What a stunning place to visit. Having initially hesitated over the cost of the gold tickets I would have no problem in recommending you book them. The interactive tablet was incredible, hold it up to whichever room you are in and see it not only as it was but see magical creatures appear from Gaudi’s architecture. I actually found it quite emotional. You also get to see extra rooms which are well worth it. I would return to this place if and when I come back to visit Barcelona. Loved it."
"September 26, 2022",5.0,Introduction to Gaudi!,Beautiful house designed by Gaudi. The gold tickets enabled us to skip the line and have a good tour with an iPad that have us lots of information and special effects. Recommend the skip the line tickets.
"September 26, 2022",5.0,Great tour!,"Touring the house ,good views, cool presentation upon exit. Learned more about the hisyory of the house."
"September 25, 2022",5.0,A Must See!,I love house tours but this home is not your usual house tour. The bonus is you can take a break on the roof top and have a glass of water or wine and enjoy the views before continueing the tour. It is well worth the time and ticket price. You do not really get a good sense of what Gaudi di from jus the outside.
"September 25, 2022",5.0,This is a Special Place,"Woodworkers'/Glassblowers'/Plasterer's Fantasy. The craftsmanship that it took to build this place is just extraordinary. Difficult to imagine what it would take to produce anything like this today. Gaudi's masterpiece for residential architecture. It's another world. Pretty accessible for people who are full-bodied. A lot of stairs, but well worth it."
"September 24, 2022",5.0,Just beautiful,"It's definitely worth it to go inside – unfortunately I did not have time, but I still enjoyed admiring the building outside and visiting the gift shop and facilities inside."
"September 24, 2022",5.0,Outstanding Baudi Architectural,Don't miss this outstanding architecture while in Barcelona. Breathtaking and worth the trip. Easily accessible via public transportation.
"September 21, 2022",5.0,Goudis House Casa Battlo,"I would advise to book early, and go early morning if you want to avoid a big queue . We were there for 9.15 which was great as we could just go right in .
Well worth the money. Go for the gold ticket, you will see and visit Goudis family apartment.
Much better than I had expected. This guy was ahead of his game . A must visit if in Barcalona."
"September 19, 2022",5.0,busy but worth the wait,"a must see place while in barcelona.can get crowded ,also a bit expensive for tickets but again well worth it"
"September 17, 2022",5.0,Fascinating Gaudi masterpiece,"The house is amazing! We bought the gold ticket, and it was worth it, as it included the family apartment and an interactive iPad. Seeing Gaudi’s vision in this building is a great complement to seeing the Sagrada Familia."
"September 16, 2022",4.0,Interesting Tour,Interesting tour. Loved learning about Gaudi and the design of the building. There’s a cafe on the roof terrace where we were able to enjoy a cold beverage before finishing the tour.
"September 13, 2022",5.0,Must see.,"As great as everyone says! Absolutely astounding. You can skip the private rooms, though, if you're cost conscious."
"September 13, 2022",5.0,A-maz-ing!,My daughter wanted to visit Casa Batlló. My first thought was that it was expensive as we went for the Gold ticket. But it was worth every penny. With the interactive tablet you get a better idea of how the house looked when Gaudi designed it. We spent a good 2 and half hours looking around with a stop at the roof top bar for a well needed drink. It was the highlight of our holiday and would recommend it to anyone who was intending to visit Barcelona.
"September 12, 2022",5.0,Really fun,"I normally don't like things like tours and museums but ended up having a great time. The audio aspect of it was surprisingly fun and interesting and really added to the experience. I would highly recommend this, and the only thing I would say is that seeing other people using the VR kind of ruined the experience, because we were just surrounded by people in headphones holding up ipads."
"September 12, 2022",5.0,A must visit in Barcelona!,I can't stress enough how beautiful this house is. It's something really unique. I recommend going there early to avoid the crowds.
"September 10, 2022",4.0,5 for Casa minus one for the fee = 4 stars,"In one word - both, the exterior and interiors of this Gaudi masterpiece are simply amazing, unique, unusual and interesting. It's an ex apartment house now converted into an astonishing (and very expensive) museum.
As it's highly popular they can raise the prices until they want, so my suggestion is to book online - you'll get a guaranteed place and save some money than buying them at the counter. Last time I was here 10y ago entry fee was around the half with everything included.
Anyway, a place not to be missed....and...they count on you."
"September 10, 2022",5.0,Recommend the gold ticket,"We bought the gold ticket; which was a little more expensive but ; we were not disappointed .
An audio guide consists of a tablet version with headphones this also includes many interactive features throughout the tour; as well as an extra room.
On first arrival you are submersed into a futuristic world; before continuing with the walking tour; an extra room half way through ;( exclusive for gold tickets holders)a roof top has a bar for refreshments and another futuristic room which completes the experience.
The home is exceptionally beautiful given the century it was designed; but than again it was a Gaudi creation"
"September 10, 2022",5.0,An architectural highlight,"This Gaudi masterpiece is a must to visit. Make sure to book tickets in advance and book an early time, it will still be busy though, just accept it and go with the flow! Marvel at the magnificent interior and be sure to book the visual/audio guide which cleverly shows you how some rooms would have looked furnished when the family lived there. This visit was a highlight of Barcelona for me. I loved it!"
"September 8, 2022",5.0,very much enjoyed tour,Very much enjoyed the tour. The audio guide was well paced and informative and added just the right amount of colour and context. The building is pretty interesting and the vision and thinking ambitious. It’s feels more intimate than other Gaudí options and I’d recommend it despite the high entry price. Probably one for adults more than kids.
"September 7, 2022",5.0,Immersive magnificence,"I didn’t anticipate the total immersive experience at Casa Battlo. It took my breath away and brought tears to my eyes, the immense beauty. Absolutely worth getting the Gold Pass. Take your time and soak it all in. Go early."
"September 5, 2022",5.0,A Gaudi masterpiece,"This is probably the coolest museum house in all of Spain, certainly in Barcelona. Gaudi was a genius and Casa Batllo is a great example of his extraordinarily unique architectural style. It was pretty hot the day we were there so we definitely spent a little time at the rooftop bar. Definitely worth a visit although it can get pretty crowded inside."
"September 5, 2022",5.0,A Must See,A brilliant experience. The home is beautiful and the history behind it really interesting. One of my favourite places in Berlin.
"September 3, 2022",5.0,Amazing House,Loved this house. Definetly worth seeing the interior. Having visited Casa Batilo & Casa Mila the difference in my openion is that the interior and the audio guide is better in Casa Batilo with Casa Mila having a stunning attic and roof. If you can afford and have the time worth visiting both.
"September 2, 2022",5.0,Stunning audio backing music and brilliant art.,"A magical underwater world. After you've choked your way through the admission price, it's utterly magical: so magical indeed, that I had a permanent metaphorical itch that a bulbous Mediterranean rainbow wrasse might swim past my bemused face - ALL WITHOUT THE USE OF HALLUCINAGENIC DRUGS. However, all of Gaudi's excellence pails into (relative) insignificance when compared with the genius of the audio guide's breath-takingly constructed backing music. Poise in music. Utterly beautiful, except the horrible bell that's been artificially added to signify the end of a track. Traumatising."
"September 2, 2022",5.0,Stunning,"A must see when visiting this city. Take a moment to view all the details, shapes and angles of this stunning building."
"August 31, 2022",3.0,Heat and humidity were distracting,"If you visit this architectural gem, try to go early in the day when it isn't so hot and humid. It was honestly stifling, and we were unable to enjoy the interior. If you're short on time in Barcelona, consider taking this off the itinerary"
"August 27, 2022",5.0,Definitely a place to visit!!,"You definitely need to come visit Casa Battlo when you are in Barcelona. It is an unbelievable house that does not look like what the inside would look like from the outside. One of Gaudi's top pieces of creation here besides the many others. Make sure you get advance online timed reservations and upon arriving, you are quickly given a head set and a table to follow around for your self tour. We took the option and paid extra for the Early 8:45 a.m. self- guided tour which was absolutely worth it.
It was so easy to follow along with the tablet as you are finished listening to that room, a bell signals you to move on to the next room.
The colors and decor that Gaudi had installed here are just beautiful and matches with each room. In the lightwell, the blue tiles keep getting darker as you head up each level and the skylight definitely blends in well to get natural lighting in.
So much detail with each room, so make sure you take a look with everything surrounding you. Up on the roof, it is very interesting with a design with the tile to create the image of the back of a dragon. Very colorful displays on the roof that resemble chimneys.
Definitely well worth a visit here early to avoid the crowds during the day!"
"August 24, 2022",5.0,Fantastic evening!,"Audio was great as was concert on the roof. The blue ticket worked just fine for the evening walk through, with the concert on the roof. Well worth the money."
"August 23, 2022",5.0,Mindblowing Gaudi building not to be missed,"Utterly stunning building by Gaudi that you must visit in Barcelona. Don’t save on the audio guide, which has some cool interactive features that allow you to get even closer to how people lived in this house."
"August 22, 2022",5.0,worth seeing it from inside,"totally worth seeing it from inside, you see much more of Gaudi's art and the interior architecture is great. The audio tour was good."
"August 20, 2022",4.0,Another Tick on my Bucket List!,"A visit to Casa Batlló was a tick on the bucket list for me, having seen the exterior many times I was thrilled to be able to go inside this time. The house is stunning, I've read books and seen photos of course but it's not like seeing - and touching - it for real! I'd pre-purchased a Gold ticket a couple of months before my visit, so was able to take advantage of the iPad with augmented reality, and found that very helpful, if a little cumbersome at times (and I somehow managed to switch the audio to Russian at one stage!!). The only disappointment I had was I didn't feel I was fully informed of what my gold ticket entitled me to when I got to the house - I overheard two other visitors asking about 'the gold room' and found out I also had access to this; if I hadn't heard this conversation I would have missed out! But if you love Gaudí, do visit Casa Batlló, even if you're not that bothered about Gaudí the house is still worth a visit as it's so unusual!"
"August 18, 2022",5.0,Great quick visit (2hrs approximately).,Beautiful architecture by Gaudi! Definitely worth a visit. We got gold tickets through Casa Batlló website just to avoid any queue.
"August 18, 2022",5.0,Magical Night,"We attended the Magical Nights concert on the rooftop. The singer was great, the cava refreshing and we enjoyed the mini tapas pack. Before the concert, we enjoyed the visit of this spectacular venue. The 3-D experience is a bit overrated."
"August 15, 2022",5.0,Stunning,"Get the Gold pass and plan on spending 2 hours. Make sure to grab a dring on the roof top terrace! The earlier you arrive the better, Barcelona isn't a ""morning"" city."
"August 15, 2022",4.0,Get the Gold,"Another great museum showing Gaudi’s work. I think Casa Mila was slightly better. This one they give you a short video at the end probably to make the experience more interesting. If you wanna go, suggest you get the Gold ticket that has the iPad feature showing how the place looked like before. Again, added feature to make the house more interesting than it is. Museum and architecture lovers will love this place."
"August 15, 2022",5.0,A must-see!,"It is not enough to see from the outside, you must buy a ticket and see the inside. It was very, very impressive even for someone like me who is not interested in architecture.
My only complaint is that I don't understand why there is no Turkish audio option when there are works on Gaudi by Turkish artist Refik Anadol in the museum. Since I speak English, it was not a problem for me, but for those who are older or very young and whose English is not good, the language option should be increased. (not only Turkish, but also many languages should be added)."
"August 13, 2022",5.0,Wow,"We prebooked our tickets and opted for the option (silver?) where you can go into the technology display downstairs. It was awesome from start to finish. First, the immersive display room was unreal..it depicts Gaudi's process, inspiration, etc. Second, the house is amazing. Third, the interactive, tablet guide was super awesome. There are so many amazing details in the house and in the way the house is presented. Loved it!!"
"August 13, 2022",5.0,Super cool house of Gaudi,Casa. Batllo is a very friendly family activity. They give out little iPads that when pointed around the room show you what the house looked like when it was being used. The furniture. The people etc. great for kids as it is interactive and educational at the same time. For adults they summer roof top nights with entertainment. You have to look on line and get a reservation. If you get one. GO. It’s a fun local experience.
"August 12, 2022",5.0,Awe inspiring home,Highly recommend. Such a beautiful work of art and very interesting tour. Nice cafe on the roof for refreshment. Give more time to take pictures. Book online for best price.
"August 11, 2022",5.0,Don't Miss,We were walking by and saw that you could visit inside. We almost didn't pay the 43 euros but figured why not. IT WAS FABULOUS!!! Be sure and get the headphones because helped make the tour. We Loved it so much we even paid for the photo taken on the tour.
"August 11, 2022",5.0,Interesting Archtecture,Interesting home showcasing some awesome Gaudi architecture! The private room was furnished with some interesting pieces.
"August 10, 2022",4.0,Organic and playful house,"I've been here many years before. This time, the experience was a bit less awe-inspiring than previous visits, but it is definitely a must-see. I purchased a Gold Ticket, which enables you to skip the line, enter an immersive room at the start, and see the private rooms where the family lived. While this was worth it (interesting glimpse into how the wealthy lived), the immersive room was not an experience at all. Just a bunch of lights on a wall and a large diorama in the center. The tablet provided for Gold ticket holders has an AR feature, but it is not particularly interesting and experiential. The table was finicky and kept resetting if it touched your body while hanging down, and you could not fast forward the description to where you left off. No need for skip the line tickets in August 2022 as there was no line. Overall, a recommend. But the step down tickets (blue) from the original website may be enough."
"August 9, 2022",5.0,Nice,This apartment complex is definitely worth visiting. If you ever cared about Gaudi’s architecture or infrastructure in general you will enjoy the tour. I did the night experience and I highly recommend. Tour guide was knowledgeable and spoke fluent English. Must go even if you swing by it only. 🙏🏼
"August 9, 2022",5.0,Nice place,"We went in the morning, and it was beautiful! The cheapest level (blue?) is all you need to enjoy the tour. The audio guide was great. The house is amazing! Worth visiting."
"August 3, 2022",5.0,Fabulous example of Gaudi's genius.,"While Sagrada Familia will be seen as Gaudi's dream still being fulfilled, Casa Batllo shows an extraordinary use of light, colour, architecture completed and enjoyed for over 100 years. As important to see as the church!"
"August 1, 2022",2.0,An expensive tourist trap,"We spent a week in Barcelona visiting many different sites, which we loved. This one was by far the most expensive and, because of that, it was the most disappointing. The house itself is truly beautiful and interesting. This could be a great tour if we were provided with a paper brochure or web site we could read while touring the building.

The audio tour was about three times too long, full of modern buzzwords and sustainability pandering that surely never crossed Gaudi's mind when designing the building. A couple of the larger rooms had been outfitted with Disneyland-like light shows that were irrelevant to the tour and made it more like a tourist trap than a historical, artistic, or architectural experience. The combined effect of the light shows and the excessively wordy audio guide was that people spent three times as long in the building as they needed to, and climbed more stairs than necessary. This made the building three times more crowded and sweaty than it needed to be, as well as much too expensive.

The building is a unique architectural gem, so what the promoter has done to it is a shame."
"July 31, 2022",5.0,Magnificant experience of Gaudi's genius,"If it wasn't for our professional guide, Joseph, with Spain Day Tours, this house wouldn't have been so spectacular."
"July 31, 2022",5.0,Must see batlo,Casa batlo was so far the most amazing museum i ever seen. The architecture was so unique! Every part of the building was different and put together so perfectly. The automatic audio guide helps a lot to understand what you are seeing in each room. This museum was very well organized and totally worth a visit. I liked it a lot!
"July 31, 2022",5.0,Breathtaking homd,"One of the most amazing buildings I have ever toured. The use of color, shape, and texture was something I had never seen."
"July 30, 2022",5.0,AMAZING,"Gaudi was a genius. This home is exquisite, the audio tour is good (if a little cheesy with the ""voice"" of the house.) Family with 3 teens and all of us entranced with this architectural marvel."
"July 30, 2022",5.0,Do in the morning if you want a cooler experience. It can get warm inside the house,"This was amazing, we loved the interactive features with the tour that we did. The kids enjoyed being able to see the different things come to life with the ipads. The roof top bar was a nice break after going up stairs and walking around. A little more on the pricey side but its well worth it."
"July 29, 2022",4.0,Beautiful building,Very beautiful “Gaudistic” architecture. In the middle of a high street. Worth passing by and it’s quite crowded. Be sure to visit in daylight
"July 27, 2022",5.0,"Impressive, beautiful and fantastically conveyed",We bought the Gold ticket and were all very impressed. The house is so beautiful and impressive and a “must see” in Barcelona. Also the use of tablets with 3D experience was fantastic - especially for our children.
"July 25, 2022",5.0,Beautiful architecture,"It was wonderful, like a children's book coming alive. Whimsical and unique, a must-see architectural gem in Barcelona."
"July 24, 2022",5.0,The play of colours,A wonderful glimpse into Gaudi's mind. I simply adore Gaudi's architecture. My second time visiting Casa Batllo. This time with the intelligent audio guide. Only wish the outside photo would be included in the gold ticket. Expensive.
"July 24, 2022",2.0,"Too expensive, sadly…","I was really looking forward to taking my sons to visit this amazing Gaudi house, however at €30 each it was just not feasible and far too expensive. Such a shame that prices are so high and not an option for a lot of people."
"July 23, 2022",5.0,Magic Nights Experience,"We hadn't done a lot of research about casa batllo but booked a magic nights experience for a birthday treat. We were taken aback walking around the house and just how stunning it is. We then had drinks at the bar at the end of the tour, whilst listening to a live performer which was perfect. The cocktails were delicious too. Would highly recommend a visit and if you can do a magic night performance over the summer, we'd definitely say to do it"
"July 22, 2022",5.0,Great experience,Great experience. The enhanced audio tour was really interesting. This was a nice opportunity to learn about Gaudi.
"July 21, 2022",5.0,Beautiful taste of Gaudi's brilliance,"Another must see in Barcelona. Casa Batllo is stunning and intricate, and the audio guide tour gives excellent background information and insight into the architect's process."
"July 19, 2022",5.0,Gaudí,"Very educational and inspirational experience. The audio guide made the experience even more fun. There several types of entrance tickets, but do not think the ticket with the AR tablet is necessary unless you are going with young children. Make sure to bring your own earphones!"
"July 19, 2022",4.0,Great but not the best thing ever,This is very good and there is a lot of interesting things to learn alongside some boring aspects (you are basically touring a big house with a lot of steps). There are absolutely some unmissable sights within the building itself and it's worthwhile to see at least ONE Gaudi building up close.
"July 15, 2022",5.0,Amazing walk through a great structure,"The beauty is in the details in this crazy-cool structure in a tony part of Barca. I recommend touring this as part of a package of several ""big spots"" in the city. We took a Viator tour and our guide's name was Oliver. His English speaking skills were good and interesting. The insight he shared was very good and one of the reasons you pay for a guided tour. My only complaint would be that the headsets did not work universally and so we had to rely on voices only in a group of about 20 in often crowded (noisy) spaces. The headset issue is not a trvival thing - it's an important part of a guided tour and is critical to the enjoyment and appreciation of the site visited. But, Im calling this attraction excellent because of its beauty and significance to the character of Barcelona."
"July 15, 2022",5.0,With the trip,"Glad we booked the standard ticket with an over 65 years discount . We used audio guides so it was easy to listen to the information as you walked around . The architecture is amazing, there seem no straight lines , there is beautiful glass work to see . We booked when we arrived around 10.30 to 10.45 , we didn’t have much of a queue , later when we came out there was a long queue. It wasn’t too crowded, there was no social distancing though.
Happy to have seen this although we thought the tickets were expensive."
"July 14, 2022",5.0,I have never seen such a beautiful architecture,"Amazing architecture by Gaudi. You must see it. Moreover, the audio visual guide was very successful. It was very easy to follow and understand the details. I strongly recommend the Platinum or Gold ticket. It's worth the amount you pay."
"July 10, 2022",1.0,Waste of money,"With the money you pay its not worth it at all
Too expensive
Also dont buy the gold ticket
Its just waste of money if you still want to visit buy the general ticket"
"July 9, 2022",3.0,"Wonderful building, expensive and crowded toour","It is an extraordinary building of course, and worth seeing despite the issues coming later in the review. We opted for the standard audioguide tour which I felt was expensive enough at 35 euros online. The audioguide has about 14 sections of 1 - 2 minutes each for different parts of the building, so it is a 45 min tour depending on how long you spin it for.

You get to visit approximately 6 empty rooms, with admittedly remarkable wall / ceiling / fitting decorations - the folding door in the main salon is particularly remarkable - including the pretty rear patio, then a climb through several (closed) floors to the top floor where you can peek in the servants quarters before going onto the roof terrace to look at the famous dragons back roof, chimneys and sword. You then go back down and out via an immersive multimedia - a short two minute presentation - before ending up in the gift shop.

A few points.

This tour seems really really expensive, especially when you consider its small size, compared to a lot of other wonderful Modernista sites in Barcelona that just don't happen to be by Gaudi, and indeed the much bigger Sagrada Familia. There are wonderful sites like the Palau Musica Catalana, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, even the Casa Amatler next door - which are better value if you can get your head around the fact that Gaudi isn't the only game in town. Make no mistake, this is a real commercial operation.

The audioguide did not tell me much about the history of the house, and the Battlo family. It did not really describe what went on on the other floors of the building which I did not get to see. Casa Amatler next door does this really well.

Safety - the multimedia show at the end is two minutes long, with a lot of flashing imagery / lights - one or two people in the group were quite disoriented and wanted to get out, but you are shut in for the duration, and we didn't get warned about the flashing light deal (not a big issue for me but I would have expected at least a warning) . The whole tour was really crowded - mid-June - and people with tablets constantly seemed to bump into others as they moved them about. We are still living in times of Covid-19, and I think they could have managed the crowds a little better.

But grumbles aside, it's a masterpiece, and as with all the other great sites in Barcelona - you gotta go!"
"July 7, 2022",3.0,Building worth seeing but see La Pedrera in preference.,The building is fabulous. A masterpiece and well worth a visit. However there were 3 price levels and no adequate explanation of what each entailed. We took the most expensive. We were provided with clunky old headphones and an heavy i pad. I didn't get very far before the audio switched form English to another language. I went down all the stairs and someone fixed it. I got up the stairs again and it happened again. I was left having to lug around the heavy i pad and clunky head phones that were of no use to me. This tour was much more expensive and half as good as the tour of La Pedrera.
"July 6, 2022",4.0,Go for the cheapest self-guided tour,"Ok, it’s a must-see masterpiece, I won’t argue that.
But the commercialization of the tour over the past decade or two has dampened the greatness of the experience. They dragged away the furniture (I guess to squeeze in more tourists - some you can see in Park Guell’s Gaudi house). There are no signs anywhere (I wonder how a deaf person can visit), they filled the house with tacky dinosaur and octopus sightings and some interesting but barely relevant visuals at the beginning and the end of the tour.
We got the gold tour, but save your money, neither the audio nor the visuals was worth the trouble, let alone the steep extra price, so get the cheapest ticket and enjoy the house.
Oh and go back at night if you can to see it illuminated."
"July 6, 2022",5.0,Must see - stunning imagination - unique,Visited in early season in a cold and wet March so not too busy in any of the rooms. We bought the standard €35 adult ticket online the day before that gave access everywhere including the roof top and the audio guide which was very useful. Such imagination and the brilliant craftsmanship in creating the interiors. The curved woodwork is incredible. Lots of uneven floors and stairs to be aware of. Probably very busy in high season so book an early time slot?
"July 6, 2022",5.0,Interesting and well managed for kids,We bought online tickets (gold). This gives you an tablet which guides you through the house. It is an interactive app that is amazing for kids. There are some moments in which it is a little long but all in all a great place to visit.
"July 5, 2022",4.0,Good Tour,A great tour to visit with the tablets. A very interesting building. Gaudi is incredible. Not sure would return again but good experience overall.
"July 5, 2022",5.0,Gaudi at his best,"The purpose of our visit was to see the marvellous works of Antoni Gaudi. This has to be one of his best. Use the audio guide and enjoy the magnificent design. From ethe entrance through to the attic you can marvel at Gaudi's use of light, then go to the roof and see the dragons back, the chimneys and stop for a drink."
"July 4, 2022",5.0,Must visit in Barcelona,Most cheerful work of genius that was Gaudi. You must visit this home in Barcelona. It is his most cheerful work ever that was built for the Battlo family from a building that Mr. Battlo wanted to tear down.
"July 4, 2022",5.0,Expensive but I loved it.,"Great to see the genious and disruptive architecture of Gaudi. Very impressive how he was innovative even so many years ago. At the end there is a very nice, imersive digital experience ."
"July 4, 2022",4.0,Gorgeous exterior,This is an iconic exterior and well worth a special trip to see it. You can spend ages gazing at the outside and spotting all the details.
"July 3, 2022",5.0,Well worth it!! A must see in Barcelona!,This was our last day in Barcelona and what a way to end our trip! This tour and Gaudi creation is a must see!! This was put together so well and so fascinating! Love every minute and the video at the end WOW!!
"July 2, 2022",5.0,"Fantastic experience of Gaudi’s architecture. Visited with teens who totally enjoyed it. Great additions, too!","Fantastic tour, lovely additions to make the most of the experience. Visited with teens who totally enjoyed it. Definitely recommend!"
"July 1, 2022",4.0,Saved by Gaudi,The physical building/house was incredible but the presentation totally diminished the experience. There was no instruction at all on how to use the audiobook and the visual component making what could have been totally immersive totally frustrating. It was only the power of the architecture and the interior spaces that surround you in the realized vision of the architect that saved the experience from falling flat. The over-blown digital production at the exit that you are forced to view completely erases the spirit of the home that Gaudi created.
"July 1, 2022",5.0,We loved that,"Worth vissiting, it must have been a joy for every one to live in this House, the Colouring and the light is beautiful"
"June 29, 2022",5.0,Worth the visit,Like everything gaudi in Barcelona this place did not disappoint. Fascinating the amount of work thaT went into this building
"June 29, 2022",5.0,Beautiful,Another masterpiece. Just a beautiful home. Can't imagine living here. What a huge and magical place.
"June 27, 2022",5.0,Extraordinary Gaudi creation,"After seeing this unique home on the Sidecar Tour, we returned to gaze at it from outside longer. When we ended up with some extra time one day, we did the tour and it did not disappoint! The architectural structure is amazing. Worth the money and time."
"June 24, 2022",4.0,Great to see Gaudi mind at work,"It is an amazing place to see. It is not cheap, but it is a place you need to visit to see the genius mind of Gaudi. The work is stunning and can see why it has UNESCO status. No visit to Barcelona is complete with out going to one of the Gaudi casa's"
"June 22, 2022",5.0,LOVE! Highly rec!,"Our trip to Casa Batllo was increíble & left me wanting to come back when I’m in Barcelona again! Definitely one of coolest things I’ve seen while traveling. Gaudí was definitely a creative & imaginative soul that was way ahead of his time!

Casa Batllo also seems to very much value their staff that are neurodivergent. 💕 At the end of the tour they made a comment about their neurodiverse team. After I left a review for them, they mentioned their neurodivergent staff. THANK YOU Casa Battlo staff for sharing this. 💗 As someone who is neurodivergent, to see them shed light on this was amazing and very admirable.

We chose the second tier ticket option. Before you go in you see a light show. Great start to the visit! The end of the tour you go into a room and the whole room showcases amazing visuals on all areas of the walls. We loved it!

The tour itself includes a tablet that has an audio tour. In some rooms you hold the tablet up and you can see moving animations. The animations were cool but I wish there they included more animations. I still recommend getting the second tier ticket. :)"
"June 21, 2022",5.0,Beautiful Mansio,Even looking at exterior is worth the trip. Walk along passeig de Gracias and look and neighboring house. Casa Amatelier is beautiful too
"June 21, 2022",4.0,Impressive Gaudi home,"Loved visiting Casa Batllo. Magical and lovely home. The intelligent Audio guide is very cool and gives a great tour. Be aware, Lots of stairs.

Got the gold pass ( not worth the extra 4 euro) extra room was off the roof not really worth it ( we missed it and went back up) And special light-show-exhibit at the end was unnecessary.

Highly recommend purchasing tix in advance, missed a long line."
"June 21, 2022",5.0,beautiful -- worth the early morning price,"This was the coolest building we saw in Barcelona. Astounding space and very cool to be there with less fellow sightseers. The audioguide is a bit cheesy since it's for a very broad ""everyone"" (the House talks to you) but it was well-done. Take your time to go through the tour because it is one-way path"
"June 20, 2022",4.0,gorgeous stop.,This is a must see place when in Barcelona. Its small and can be walked thru in 45 minutes but its worth it. The whole point of traveling is seeing things right.? I went in the afternoon and crowd was small. Buy ticket online makes it easier. I was in a Hotel close by so could get pictures of the outside during the day and at night when its lit up which is cool. I decided to do Park Guell in the early morning then took a quick cab from there to here at noon. about a 10 min cab ride. Perfect morning.
"June 20, 2022",5.0,Gaudi masterpiece,"This is an amazing house designed by Gaudi. I have seen it from the outside many times but this is the first time I actually visited the inside. The audioguide is very good and essential to fully understand what is going on.
The place is a UNESCO world heritage site and it is easy to see why.
It is quite expensive to visit but you can see why.
Currently at the end of the visit there is an ""exhibition"" that lasts 3 minutes and is called Inside Gaudi's mind - this was one of the best things I have seen in a long time."
"June 17, 2022",5.0,Guadi work of art,High point of Barcelona visit. This place is magical and dreamy work of art by Guadi. Probably one of high points for our kids as well. A must see
"June 17, 2022",5.0,It was ok,We were given headphones and it was a self guided tour through an empty house. Many stairs to climb. The tour talked about Gaudi and how he designed each area of the house
"June 17, 2022",5.0,Beautiful Artistic Architecture,"I really enjoyed the tour. It was expensive, but I had never been inside the actual house and the inside is just as remarkable as the outside. The audio tour and music was a nice complement and gave lots of information, even reminding you to pause and appreciate all of the beauty and design that went into the house."
"June 14, 2022",3.0,Expensive experience,"The architecture looks fantastic and I overall had a great time. The additional room to see with silver tkt were worth it.

The gold is just some additional private room and were not recommended by the front desk. Incredible view over Barcelona!

The tablette is a nice touch!

Only negative point is the price, you could at least offer the picture for the silver and gold tkt...

Still had the feeling it was overpriced, but a must see in Barcelona 😂"
"June 14, 2022",3.0,tourist trap,"The house is absolutely amazing, we made the mistake of opting for a concert on the roof - low grade piano bar 80's kareoke"
"June 13, 2022",5.0,Great Audio Tour!,This was the second stop in our tour of Gaudi architecture. The audio guide is very helpful in making everything you see more meaningful. Would definitely recommend the visit!
"June 13, 2022",5.0,A wondrous magical tour.,I loved Seeing the interiors and the roof. The auidoguide commentary was very good and the accompanying music was very apt and helped evoke the experience of being in an underwater garden
"June 12, 2022",5.0,Art/ mansion,A must see in Barcelona. Such a unique tour to do and unlike anything else we saw on the trip. It was about an hour long but could be as slow or as fast as you want it to be. The ticket price includes a head set that narrates the walk through the mansion for you. You dont have to reserve tickets ahead of time we just went there and bought them the day of. Very cool experience.
"June 9, 2022",5.0,Must visit,"We went in the morning when nor muchbpeople were there.

"June 8, 2022",5.0,Don't miss the Magic Nights,Just LOVED the rooftop concert experience. Very fun. Did the tour followed by the concert and greatly enjoyed both.
"June 8, 2022",5.0,Breathtaking and Whimsical,"This is a place of incredible imagination and creativity! His organic design and attention to detail is beyond magnificent. I can't recommend this place enough. ** Just a heads up though, it is significantly warm in the majority of the building."
"June 8, 2022",5.0,What an imagination,Well worth a visit. Gaudi’s connection with nature is extraordinary. The design details in this building are a delight. Love that his work occurs elsewhere in the city.
"June 7, 2022",3.0,"Far, far too expensive!!","Very nice place, but absolutely not worth the price. Compared to other similar things to see and do in Barcelona, or Europe in general, the price is more than twice as expensive. You can go to the Pena Palace in Sintra, La Sagrada Familia, or Versailles or less than half the price."
"June 6, 2022",5.0,A must see place,"Great place to visit
We visited in evening , no queues and a lot quieter
Audio guide is really good
Loved the freedom to see at your own time and the audio guide works on its own which was great"
"June 4, 2022",3.0,Could have been so much more…music nights,"Booked gold magic nights…music was great, seat was good, service could have been -1 person serving half the place which included gold and basic - very understaffed. “Could” have been an exceptional experience. Should support the musicians more with better setup…!"
"June 4, 2022",5.0,Unbelievable House!,"This house is unbelievably interesting and beautiful. If you want to learn about Gaudi, go see this house and the Sagrada Familia. The admissions desk is also very reasonable. We mistakenly booked May 30th thru Trip Advisor, but that conflicted with our Explore Catalonya tour. So we asked if we could gain entrance on May 29th, and no problem."
"June 3, 2022",5.0,A house unlike any other.,The most unusual unique house you have ever seen. Only 6 euros for a special quality photo stood on the balcony.
"June 2, 2022",5.0,fantastic place,Fantastic. I can't describe how beautiful it is. You should go there yourself and see the beauty. I spent hours there.
"June 1, 2022",5.0,Incredible design,"Basic entrance perfectly adequate. The most impressive structure I have ever seen, second only to the pyramids! (For completely different reasons, of course). Such attention to detail. A fantastic experience, excellent value for money."
"May 30, 2022",5.0,"Pricy, but fun","We got the least expensive ticket and was really happy with the baseline ticket. The gift store was really nice, and the 10D ending was really really awesome."
"May 28, 2022",5.0,"Amazing place, dont miss it","What an imagination Gaudi had, this house is spectacular. Each room is a delight in itself and the whole package is really indescribable, no adjectives do it justice"
"May 28, 2022",5.0,Unique place - you must go inside.,"Never seen anything like it. Fantastic building - attention to detail. Wonderful experience, well worth the entrance fee."
"May 28, 2022",4.0,Crowded interior but great architecture,"This is a masterpiece of architecture and I want to give it a 5 so bad but the interior tour is not worthy of a 5. It's stunning, sure, but the place is packed with tourists, even at like 35-40€ entry fees. You can basically show up and buy a ticket online when you get there, and walk in, so there's no meaningful crowd control.

They built a handy VR handset which allows the gold ticket people to see the architecture as though there was nobody there, so there are also a bunch of drone tourists with headsets staring at screens they're waving around.

All in all, stunning architecture, worth the view from the outside. I think the interior tour is just a call you should make based on how much you like gaudi and how much you like large crowds"
"May 26, 2022",2.0,Too expensive,"I spent 50 euro's on the gold ticket, which luckily i can do because i'm rich, but with a starting price of 35 euro's it stops the tourists on a budget from accessing it.....which is a real shame......or perhaps this is done on purpose. keep out the riff raff. digusting that some tourists wont be able to visit because of the high cost - i hate soceity sometimes."
"May 25, 2022",5.0,Another Barcelona Gem,"Do you love Guadi? If yes then you must visit this gem on Passeig de Gracia. Centrally located and mainly open every day, except holidays. Buy your ticket online before going."
"May 24, 2022",4.0,Nice to visit even if only have time for the outside,Can only rate it a 4 as did not go inside. Found it was very interesting to visit and see his architecture on the exterior. Was happy to at least see it
"May 23, 2022",5.0,Stunning facia,"As we visited Casa Mila we did not go into Casa Battlo but well worth visiting to admire the exterior. Situated on one of the main strips, you can also enjoy shopping at the designer and well known stores such as Versace or Mango."
"May 19, 2022",5.0,Magic night worth every penny,"Magic night was a fantastic experience. Yes it’s pricy but worth it and was highlight of our trip.
3D tablet guide with noise cancelling headphones took us around the house which is amazing. Got to the roof terrace where entertaining jazz band did a set while we drank cava watching the sun go down.
On the way back down the cube gave us a sound and light show which blew us away.
Thoroughly recommend."
"May 19, 2022",4.0,Blue tour - seemed expensive so initially unsure- having been - it was worth it !,We visited here after visiting casa mila and being impressed by that. Both designed by gaudi. The tour consisted of an audio guide which explained enough information without going into too much depth. I learned enough to appreciate the building and it’s contents and the owners who commissioned gaudi to do the renovations. It is beautiful inside and is definitely worth the experience of walking around and taking in the mot unusual design. There is video in the back room which shows how the family would have sat at the dinning table. There is a 3D visual experience at the end of the tour. I did wonder if the floors that were not a accessible were apartments and it would have been good if the audio guide would have explained. But overall worth visiting and worth the blue ticket price I thought
"May 17, 2022",3.0,worth seeing but pricey,"Interesting yet disappointing after seeing the Sagrada Familia. The house is unfurnished , leaving the rooms feeling flat and lifeless. It's a creative approach to standard room features. The exterior and the roof top are the most interesting parts.
Be advised that there are 6 or 7 floors to the house so it is a lot of stairs to climb. There is a small elevator if needed. Tickets are expensive, about $45."
"May 16, 2022",4.0,Beautiful but costly for what it has to offer,"There are 3 types of tickets and I bought the cheapest one which costs €39. I managed to get it for about €30 from a reseller.

The place is very beautiful but also very crowded. Many people do not pay the hefty price for the ticket and they just took photos from outside the building. You can also do this with Casa Mila as they are located just about 300 meters away from each other.

Can consider adding this to your itinerary if you don’t mind the costly price for a visit which will lasts for at most and hour."
"May 16, 2022",5.0,Don’t miss this if you’re going to Barcelona,"Great experience, would recommend having the audio guide as you get so much more from it. Definitely a must see if you’re visiting Barcelona"
"May 16, 2022",4.0,Batllo Walk,"Stunning architecture and history, though a bit pricey at 39EU for the lowest entry fee. Great history learned. The audio guide was informative but a bit annoying. It was presented as a dialogue with one character as the house itself and other voices taking on the role of Gaudi and others. The narration was unnecessarily flowery with music interludes, perhaps used as a pacing mechanism for crowds. I would have preferred a simple documentary-style narrative.
The house is very beautiful, and you learn of his approaches to architectural challenges. Well worth the visit, but still pricey."
"May 16, 2022",4.0,Special place,"Different architecture.
Signature of Gaudi's art.
Different vision to architeting.
This building is subway access."
"May 15, 2022",5.0,Our Favorite Gaudi Residence,"This house was incredible ,especially if you love the sea. The audio guide was wonderful, as well. So many details to look at!"
"May 14, 2022",5.0,A must See experience,Loved the iPad walk through. Easy to follow and loved the personal touches in that program. You get to see so much of the inside. Worth the price!
"May 11, 2022",5.0,Wonderful experience,We had a wonderful time visiting casa batllo and the explanations of the guide. I highly recommend it. Staff was helpful too
"May 11, 2022",5.0,A must see!,"Fabulous place, extraordinary design inside and out. Gaudi was such a genius it is hard toeven comprehend how he managed to see his incredible ideas tofruition. A must see. Rooftop bar was an extra wee treat!"
"May 10, 2022",1.0,Not worth the moeny.,They took 45 euros for Gold ticket . Regular ticket 35 euros . No diffrence between gold and regular. There is a bar on the roof and a place that they ask for moeny in order to take picture. They are just after your moeny. The most important creation of Guedi in Bercelona is Segreda Familia . Dont spend moeny on the small structure of Casa Bilto which is so expensive. Do not let them tske your moeny for nothing.
"May 10, 2022",5.0,A must see,Our family enjoyed this tour so much. Probably our favorite thing to see in Barcelona. The tablets were a great touch and made it fun for kids. Very informative and beautiful architecture. Definitely recommend!
"May 9, 2022",4.0,Worth a quick visit.,"Casa Battlo was impressive especially the roof. But I would not spend any more than the most basic ticket price. Nor would I pay for a tour. We had the audio tour which was fine. But we were constantly bumped into by those using the iPads since those people weren't really paying attention to their surroundings. Very annoying.

I also wish the museum had more staff inside to improve the flow especially on the stairs where selfie takers would gather, take a 1,000 photos of themselves & each other and often blocked people from continuing their own tours.

Other than that....it was a fairly pleasant experience that only took on hour."
"May 7, 2022",4.0,Fantastic house and nice experience,"The only downside is that it felt crowded although the numbers inside indicated that only ""48% of the allowed audience"" was used. But it felt as just enough already. There are clear indications for the walking route but many people didn't understand it which made it even more difficult to move on."
"May 6, 2022",1.0,Disappointing,"So overpriced for what you get. Although the outside looks great, the inside was so underwhelming. Save your money and visit other sites"
"May 6, 2022",4.0,Interesting audio guided tour of a unique artistic designed home,"Very interesting tour of this unique residence that is worth the price of admission. Although much of what you'll see is impractical to build, it demonstrates what can be done using skilled craftsmanship following the artist's design ideas. Audio tape was helpful but a bit over-dramatic."
"May 4, 2022",5.0,worth the visit. roof bar,"Great visit, more to see than expected. Special prices for persons with disabilities on site.
Do not miss the roof bar"
"May 3, 2022",5.0,WOW,"Another must see. Even if you don't venture inside, you have to go and see this amazing building, especially after sun down!
Don't miss it!"
"May 3, 2022",2.0,"There's far better, far cheaper Gaudi places - skip this one!","Save your money and visit other, better Gaudi buildings. Say Sagrada or Casa Vicens. This was very boring and architecturally uninteresting (apart from a few rooms / features that are not worth the very! expensive ticket).

The audioguide is incredibly overbearing, long and uses extra music and tidbits that bring nothing to the experience. Instead through an app or link that you get at other places, you listen to this through a phone like thing that detracts from the visit. Why would you want to carry this around if you could use your headphones? For the money this place rakes in, you'd think they'd invest in something more of the current time.

The house itself is most interesting from the outside, which you can see for free from the road. I'm a fan of Gaudi's work but this is not his finest. It's repetative, you see one floor and you've seen them all. Other reviews point this out as well - listen to it, skip the house and save yourself the money."
"May 3, 2022",5.0,Incredible psychedelic experience of a Gaudi house,"Although seemingly quite expensive (€45 each) , the visit was about 1 hour and was fantastic value. Brilliant system of tablet and earphones enhanced the whole experience. Not to be missed."
"May 3, 2022",5.0,Amazing!!,"Amazing place.
It's a must do for anyone visiting Barcelona.
Wonderful , innovative , well ahead of its time 'house'- but house like nothing seen before !
Just stunning.
See for yourself

Easy to follow directions."
"May 1, 2022",4.0,See this if you love Gaudi,"One of Gaudi's houses, one of the must sees in Barcelona. The audio guide is good but a bit long winded. Still an interesting visit and worth doing"
"May 1, 2022",2.0,Cannot recommend it,"Underwhelming, kindof a mishmash of ideas with no cohesion. Take a look at photos of the back to get an idea of what I mean. Other gaudi structures are far superior and the best view is from the front outside"
"April 29, 2022",5.0,GAUDI Arquitechture,"Aparte of other attractions, Casa Batllo is a mandatory place to visit. Really nice visit, even if you think the tickets seem to be quite expensive."
"April 27, 2022",5.0,fabulous,What a fabulous experience. Myself and my husband did the full interactive tour and it was well worth it. would highly recommend.
"April 26, 2022",5.0,Beautiful house by Gaudi,"The building is cleverly designed by Gaudi, loved how he got the light through to the apartments, and all the details he put in. The audio guide was very good. The price of the ticket is higher than expected (even though we bought the ""blue"" ticket) but I'm glad we visited the place."
"April 25, 2022",5.0,Unusual,"We just walked to the building, really unusual from the outside. Beautiful building! A very big tourist attraction, huge queues to get in and around the building. People taking the perfect Instagram shot."
"April 24, 2022",4.0,Worth it,"Very glad I booked this as we woke up to torrential rain and would have been stuck without an activity. Overall I loved it, so did my 11 year old who is into art, my 9 year old not so much but his tablet wasn’t working properly so could have been part of the problem. I thought it was so well thought out, very stylish and quite mesmerising listening to the commentary and watching the house come alive. The art installation on the way out was great too."
"April 22, 2022",5.0,A visit to WaterWorld,"A fascinating place to visit. Designed by Gaudi as an homage to an undersea world, the house employs color, wavy lines, and grotto-like interiors. You don’t see places like this. A must visit if you are going to Barcelona"
"April 21, 2022",4.0,"Interesting architecture, something totally unique to Barcelona.",Barcelona is home to some very interesting architecture from Gothic to Gaudi. Like looking at a great piece of art in a museum I find something different and interesting every time I look at these places-endless discoveries.
"April 21, 2022",5.0,Amazing experience at Casa Batllo!,What an amazing experience! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Casa Batllo while visiting Barcelona. We purchased the Blue tickets which came with an audio tour. The tour was very well done and helped us see many of the features and details of the house that we would otherwise have missed or not appreciated. Definitely do not miss this experience to appreciate the genius of Gaudi’s talent.
"April 21, 2022",4.0,Another Gaudi masterpiece,"Casa Batllo is another of Gaudi's prominent works, it is situated within walking distance of Placa Catalunya so is easy to find. You can definitely tell the building was designed by Gaudi with it's distinctive style, definitely worth at least a walk passed if in Barcelona."
"April 19, 2022",4.0,Unique building,"Tourist attractive, worth a visit if you like something different. Light show inside at night. You can buy tickets on the day."
"April 17, 2022",5.0,A must when visiting Barcelona,A truly amazing experience revealing and describing in detail Gaudi's work. Not the cheapest but probably on par with most city attractions. Book your tickets in advance to save time and queuing. The experiences provided are very well done and the tablet is very informative. If you like architecture or just Gaudi it is worth every Euro
"April 17, 2022",5.0,Wonderful place,"I had been to casa batilo many times but i booked the evening show for the first time, it is beautiful with lights and champanhe, a little disappointed with the singer though, its casa batilo, it should be a better performer..."
"April 16, 2022",5.0,Must See,"I purchased the Gold tickets and entered very quickly. I didn't really use the virtual aspect on the tablet that they provided, but the audio guide is a must. Without the audio guide you cannot possibly walk away with the experience that you should. I know that might sound crazy, but it's true in this case. The price for a Gold ticket was $38 USD, which is a bit on the high side, but I hate lines. It's funny though, because the only lane with a line to get in was the Gold lane. I went at 11:00 and got there at 10:45 and they let us in early. My hotel was in the immediate area and in the afternoon you can barely walk through all of the people crowding in front of it, either waiting to get in or just taking pictures."
"April 16, 2022",5.0,Recommend doing it,Better than I expected. I loved the artistic work behind the structure and how it was brought to life through technology.
"April 15, 2022",5.0,"Excellent, detailed tour of this wonderful building","I booked the 'Gold ticket' for my visit and got an interactive tablet that showed depictions of the house back when it was in use by the Batllo family and had some other features. No need for it if you're on a budget, as I think the basic audio guide would be more than enough. The gold ticket also gets you a shorter entry queue, and a short immersive display when you first enter.

I loved seeing the Casa Batllo and highly recommend a visit. It's not the cheapest attraction (my ticket was about €50) but the level of information given and the clear care taken in terms of preservation and renovation justify the price.

There are some interactive parts - you can have a photo taken on a front balcony which you can then purchase (be ready quickly as you get very little warning, as my first terrible attempt showed!) and there is a section where you can put on old clothing and take photos in one of the rooms.

The route takes you right through the house, from bottom to top, including the terrace area and the attic / servants areas.

The audio guide was highly informative and available in multiple languages. Friendly, helpful staff also seemed to speak Spanish and English as necessary, as well as Catalan. The guide provides loads of info about Gaudi, his style, his influences, the workings of the Casa, the innovative techniques employed by Gaudi... a great deal of care and thoughtful knowledge included in the tour.

There is a lift if climbing stairs is difficult for you - it is small but I think enough for a wheelchair to go in, if necessary.

Not sure it's an attraction for children - some people had brought young children along and they seemed to be bored and tired - it is a lot of walking and climbing.

Even with the gold ticket I had to queue for about 20 minutes to get inside. This is probably due to 1) the busyness of the attraction and 2) Covid restrictions. I'd advise booking online and picking a time slot (not sure you can just show and enter without a time slot actually) and arrive about ten mins beforehand.

I booked my ticket on the day and was able to arrange my time at very short notice. Easy to get to, right next to a Metro and a short walk from the city centre if you'd rather take a walk down the Pg de Gracia."
"April 14, 2022",1.0,Rip off,Took one look at the ridiculous price and left. Ripping off tourists is not a good look. Price to enter was higher than the cost of my flight from London to Barcelona!
"April 14, 2022",5.0,The early morning tour,"What a wonderful building. I'd heard so much about Gaudi, it seemed impossible for him to live up to expectation. Wrong! But with so many people, even mid Sept the way to see Casa Batllo is the E36 ticket that allows 20 people in before they open at 9:30. It's a lot I know, but so worth it."
"April 12, 2022",5.0,A must see in Barcelona,"This building is amazing and a must see when in Barcelona. We used the audio visual guide through the gold route. It was excellent and easy to use. A great example of Gaudi’s architecture.
We took our time and were maybe about 3 hours.
There are many stairs but there is also a lift so I’m not sure about if mobility issues affect you if it’s accessible or not."
"April 12, 2022",3.0,Interesting but very pricey,"I went at opening time and I'd advise this if you want to get decent photos as it is soon teeming with people. The audio guide was informative but reset itself to low volume so I struggled to hear part way through. I paid for the gold ticket to get some sort of extra access though not sure what that was as nobody checked my 'gold' status anywhere. Interesting visit but I would say very overpriced at around £40 for something you can do in an hour. Compare this to somewhere like Blenheim Palace you can spend the day at for less, or our excellent London museums - Barcelona entry fees everywhere make it a very pricey visit, especially as you will inevitably want to see Sagrada Familia too. I'd say that is better value if you need a Gaudi fix"
"April 11, 2022",5.0,beautiful!,"although we did not take the tour of the inside, the exterior of the home is gorgeous. you would not expect to see it from the outside on the street, but it fits beautifully in the neighborhood. This is one you want to visit"
"April 10, 2022",3.0,stunning but not keen on post-covid changes,"not only is this beautiful but it is designed with such detail it really is an incredible home. i have to say, my post-covid visit was less impressive than my pre-covid - it seems that they have premiumized some areas which I feel was unnecessary"
"April 10, 2022",3.0,Not with young children or babies- not suitable,"Not with young children and babies.
I had been on trip advisor as always to look at reviews and see if it was suitable as I was travelling with my daughter and grandaughter of 9 months. Couple of reviews had said suitable so we booked as been recommended to go.
Beautiful house, we booked the blue ticket- for this you see 2 floors and a rooftop terrace.
It is not child friendly at all- especially if you have a pram. Very difficult to get around- think we possibly missed some as well.
My grandaughter did love the final room which was all digital 360 with lots of lights and music.
Beautiful but disappointing"
"April 9, 2022",5.0,Must see museum in Barcelona: Casa Batllo!!,"I've never been one to visit a lot of museums. But this visit was more than worth it's while!!! Loved it!!
You can look at the building from the outside but this doesn't to it justice at all. Casa Batllo can be visited with several ticket formula's. We went all in with the golden ticket (children entered for free) and got a tablet with extra features and a lot of interesting news in our own language (Dutch). I came to appreciate the architect Gaudi very much and a visit to Casa Battlo is extremely worth it. Go for it!!"
"April 8, 2022",5.0,Beautiful Building,Must see while in Barcelona very beautiful colorful building. We stumbled upon this while shopping!!
"April 2, 2022",2.0,Honest review,"We arrived with great expectations of seeing everything that the website showed… well to our surprise the house is beautiful but everything that Gaudí did was on the first floor and you can walk through it in 15 minutes…. We took 4 photos and that was it….Overpriced tour and poor customer service. We saw several tourists like us who arrived 10 minutes after 19:00 for the last tour and were not allowed to enter and were treated in a very horrible way. I would like you to give a customer service training to the shift supervisor, Mr. Peña.

PS Our best photos were taken from the outside of the building."
"March 30, 2022",5.0,Amazing again,"Amazing again. Lots of people though. A nice self guided tour. I prefer ""human"" guided but well worth a look at a house designed by Gaudi."
"March 27, 2022",5.0,Amazing,"Interactive tablet excellent, enjoyed the extra Gold package attractions at the beginning and end of tour. Gold package well worth the extra money."
"March 25, 2022",5.0,"So, so beautiful","I was in total awe of this amazing building. I absolutely love the design and the colours. It really felt like being inside a dragon! This is a must see if you come to Barcelona. I really want to live here! There was an audio guide which gave you the history of the house and the family, which was interesting, although I struggled to navigate in places as I couldn’t find the numbers that the audio corresponded to. There was this room you went into right at the end, which I found a bit confusing. I thought I was queuing to leave, but I went into this room with no exits and I didn’t know what was going on. I was about to leave when suddenly the doors shut, which panicked me a bit, but then this video came on, and it covered all 4 walls, plus the ceiling and floor. I didn’t really understand it to be honest. It didn’t last long. Lovely gift shop, where I picked up a beautiful Gaudi style Christmas bauble. Well worth a visit."
"March 24, 2022",5.0,A win of engineering and aesthetics.,"A great tour of a wonderful creation. The Blue ticket sufficed for us as it covers almost all of the tour except for a couple additional displays. Depending on your interest and how deep you soak it up, the self paced tour lasts about 1 1/2 hrs. It’s a must see in Barcelona."
"March 17, 2022",5.0,"A must do, absolutely amazing","Absolutely must do while in Barcelona. Ticket is not cheap but if you made it all the way to Barcelona you are hardly poor and can afford to buy the ticket.
We absolutely loved the audio guide, it was amazing how it switched from room to room and gave you information. There is so much to see and learn while being here. The shop is also lovely and you can buy good quality souvenir here."
"March 16, 2022",5.0,Enjoy,Great way to see this amazing building and appreciate the genus of this architect. He created a whimsical building that was functional from the ventilation system to the balcony in the main rooms of the house. Well worth the time and money
"March 14, 2022",5.0,A must visit,This is definitely worth the 49 euros to visit this. Can’t explain how Gaudi came up with some a wonderful place
"March 14, 2022",5.0,"A must to do in Barcelona, absolutely fantastic","This experience is a must do if going to Barcelona. We went at the end of our trip and it was the highlight for me. We went Gold which is pricy, but I feel completely worth it. The whole house and experience at end is memorable. If possible go when it is dry weather, as part of tour is outside. Be incredibly careful if wet, as else you could fall down stairs. Other thing, is to check volume control is fully working on gadget. One kept resetting itself to low volume, other gadget was fine. Move gadget around the room right from the start, else you might miss things. I absolutely loved doing this visit though and would recommend all to do it."
"March 11, 2022",1.0,Unable to cancel,"I had emergent surgery two weeks before my trip and could not go. I tried many ways to cancel and the process was so complicated, I had to pay for a tour I could not attend as there was no way to cancel it."
"March 1, 2022",4.0,Entry is expensive so we just viewed from the street as paid for Sagrada Familia tour & Gaudi Park,We only saw this from the outside as the entry price is quite expensive and neither myself or my husband being particularly into Gaudi then we decided to just go and see these from the street. Sometimes you just have to prioritize what you are going to spend your money on and we had done a guided tour of Sagrada Familia and we had decided to go to the Gaudi Park as well which you pay to get into so this & Casa Mila we just viewed from the street.
"February 28, 2022",3.0,Nice Place. A must if you go there,"Good place to see, but honestly, is you already went to ""La Pedrera"" it's all same Gaudí.
You can choose one of them and would be good to go."
"February 25, 2022",5.0,"No words, amazing!","I had an amazing guide for Barcelona for a day and had very strange, funny and special stories about this building. Many tourists around, but if you go a bit further you can see all the specialitys. No words.."
"February 23, 2022",5.0,Perfect treat with Cube Experience as cherry on-the-top,If you love architecture get ready for this mind blowing Gaudi experience. This restored project is easy to enjoy with some jaw dropping features. Audio guide provides AI dimension to the tour and good narrative. The Cube experience is total fun and a great conclusion to an already excellent attraction.
"February 21, 2022",2.0,Money + Greed go hand in hand - a travesty against Gaudi.,"This Casa is beautiful and a also bucket-list stop for me, having been in Barcelona for the 1st time. Unfortunately this experience spoiled it completely.

1) Remove crazy high price and charge €12-15 per ticket, get rid of tired tickets.
(i bought a gold member price for €45, insane. )

2) INSTALL A COAT CHECK to carry all your shopping and winter coat around is insane

3) get rid of ""intelligent"" audio phones, and use what Casa Mila has, a normal headset that does not fall off, and a small hand-held or which you can clip on to your purse, and rewind and FF at your whim. The ipads are SO ANNOYING, mine broke and i could not find one staff member who could help me. Finally someone came and removed it and did not give it back (!)

4) incorporate the balcony photo in the price of the ticket. to charge a whopping €12 over the cost of the ticket is insane.

5) employ multiple kind empathetic people and have them situated all over the house for easy access. the staff currently are rude + unhelpful

6) have clear signs: as a gold member i missed the 2 rooms that i was supposed to have access to (!)

7) remove the uninformative installation of a doll with projections over the room, and the Cube installation that has nothing to do with Gaudi."
"February 19, 2022",4.0,"Amazing, but EXPENSIVE!!","We paid EUR45 each for the gold ticket, where you get a tablet computer for your audio guide and you also get a half-bottle of champagne (advertised to be in a special gold ticket holder only bar, but is currently in a tiny roped-off section of a small terrace). The tablet didn't add a lot to the experience, and one part of it (an interactive model of the house as it was before and with Gaudi's additions) didn't work, so you may as well get the cheapest tickets. In fact the whole audio guide was mostly breathy suggestions about what your imagination might conjure up. All that said, the house is stunning, and there is an amazing immersive cinema experience at the end. It's also nice to know your ticket money is keeping the house maintained."
"February 17, 2022",5.0,Just wonderful,Absolutely beautiful. Inspiration with amazing guide in headphones. Friendly staff. Stunning architecture for everyone
"February 16, 2022",5.0,I keep coming back.,I have been to this house on a number of occasions and it never cease to amaze me. Gaudi was some genius and it was wonderful to take the prip throughout it again. One negative is the cost of voisiting is quite expensive and if its your first time do not let the price put you off.
"February 9, 2022",5.0,Casa Batlló is one of the most unique constructions you’ll ever see,"This place is just amazing, the construction, level of detail and all from the 1920’s. How the house flowed, and interacted. It must have been a masterpiece in its day, the aquatic them through the house and how the airflow system functioned 100 years ago. A must see!!"
"January 27, 2022",2.0,How to ruin an attraction with greed,"Just to be clear: I am rating the visit to the Casa Bartló, not the house itself. Casa Bartló is a masterpiece and is a joy to visit.

But the visit was a bad experience from start to finish.

First, I was charged more than twice the undiscounted admission to the Louvre for a very short visit.

My first contact with the people who run the attraction was at the entrance. I arrived 10 min early and went to the spot reserved for waiting. Someone came out of the house to tell me - quite rudely - that I should not wait there and should go somewhere near to grab a coffee.

The ticket is an example of a tied sale. I just wanted to see the house, but the visit includes an audioguide and two multimedia things (Gaudi Dome and Gaudi Cube) that I had to pay for. The Gaudi Dome is just bad - a dummy sitting at a desk while lights and noise are provided for some mysterious purpose. The Gaudi Cube is worse: it provides what Shakespeare called ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" in an installation that was supposed to get into Gaudi's mind.

The audioguide is annoying. The house talks to you (no, I did not get the version for kids). It glorifies Gaudi to unnecessary extent. For instance, more than once they say that the project of the house provided perfect lighting and ventilation - but for some reason they use artificial light and air conditioning.

When you get to the ceiling you find out that the terrace is used for dining so there are wires and lamps everywhere that interfere with the photos you take. It is hard to accept that they could not have hired a good project with lighting that does not interfere.

And then there is a window at the top that is kept under lock and key. It will open only if you buy a picture for 12 euro. A staff member takes care that you do not even get close enough to peek out of the window when someone is taking their picture.

It is really a shame that this impressive achievement in architecture and engineering, with a solid artistic motif, is managed so poorly.

The audioguide was easy to turn off, the Dome was easy to skip, but exiting the Cube was impossible, the door only opens when the thing ends, and the wires on the terrace will be an integral part of the pictures I took."
"January 24, 2022",5.0,Get a tour guide!,We did an architecture tour & got in as a group. He pointed out so many unique features & explained the why & how.
"January 23, 2022",5.0,Nice place,Excellent tour! We enjoyed dressing up with hats and clothes from that time. Took funny pictures and have a nice afternoon in the garden drinking wine. Very good!
"January 22, 2022",5.0,Expensive but Worth it!!,Gaudi design is incredible. The tour was incredible. You had a timed visit and could get a small discount by booking online. The house was breathtaking. The audio tour was so well done with beautiful music to accompany the narrative. It was about $40 a piece but I would have been sad to miss this. I could easily live here!
"January 20, 2022",5.0,"If you love art deco, this is the place to see Gaudi's work at its best.","Just the exterior (day and night time) makes this a great destination for art deco and architecture fans. The inside tour covers much more than Casa Pedrera and is much bolder and more beautiful. This is the Gaudi house to see along with Park Guell and of course, Familia Segrada which is worth seeing from the outside as well as the inside (as of 2020)."
"January 17, 2022",5.0,Work of art,"Lovely experience!! Audio guide was interesting and it goes well when you’re entering another room. It was like you’re part of the casa as well. There were a few people during our visit which was great! Although from the outside, people are flocking to see the famous Casa Batlló. The architecture was really interesting. The price for the ticket is a bit pricey, but it’s worth a try since you’re paying for the history itself and also to check out one of Gaudi’s work."
"January 14, 2022",5.0,"Astounding experience, but decline the video tour for kids","Wonderful, immersive and inspiring. An absolute must if you're visiting Barcelona. The audio guide is excellent, and the various screens reenacting how the rooms were formerly used are a fabulous touch. My one complaint is with the video tours they provide for children on tablet were ill-conceived. The devices themselves aren't very user friendly for younger kids, and having the children staring at screens while climbing stairs and moving through narrow corridors is not ideal. Also not sure why you'd want your kids staring at a screen when they're in a real place of extraordinary beauty. To be fair to the staff, we went back a few minutes into the tour and asked them to swap the kids' tablets for the the adult audio tour, which they did without fuss, and our experience was much better for it. All in all, an incredible experience and so glad we went. Don't miss it."
"January 8, 2022",4.0,Impressive building,"This is one of the most important buildings of Gaudi which is located in the wonderful street Paseo de Gracia. Gaudi rebuilt an existing building which was constructed by Emilio Sala Cortes in 1875. The colors and shapes which were used by Gaudi in this work, are inspired by marine life. In my personal opinion the ambiance would be even more effective if the associated furniture could also be seen , as in the case of Casa Mila."
"January 6, 2022",5.0,Such an entertaining Gaudi house!,"Casa Batllo was our 10 year old daughter’s absolute favorite attraction in Barcelona. We got the gold ticket package online the day before which included the Gaudi dome and Gaudi cube—amazing tech addons to the actual Gaudi house that really made the visit spectacular. The audioguide worked on wireless bluetooth headphones which is so much nicer than the wired sets at La Pedrera. The gold package also included a rest stop on one of the floors where you can put on props and take old timey photos (prob not what you want during covid but it’s there for you if you want). It also included free drink tokens for the rooftop terrace bar which is a great place to hang out and view the city. Batllo really showcases Gaudi’s style. While not as architecturally amazing as La Pedrera IMO, the dome and cube really put it over the top."
"December 25, 2021",3.0,A little bit disappointment,"Casa Batllo had spent quite a lot of money on advertisements but the tour itself is a little bit disappointed.
The house is well preserved and maintained. However, the audio tour is trying to add too much to it. It is a great building with some integrated high tech stuff but the story and the way they describe this building is a little bit too much. You can probably learn more about the design and building on the youtube channel without all theses redundant story and description. It did not worth the 50min time and definitely did not worth to the super high ticket price.
Park Guell and Sagrada Familia are way worth your time and the tickets are way cheaper."
"December 25, 2021",5.0,Amazing,"One of Gaudi’s best works! The sign postings were very clear, staff was also very helpful. Clean & they followed all sanitary protocols. I highly recommend!"
"December 24, 2021",5.0,Unique experience,"What a place!!!!
Its a great experience you might never have again.
Ticket could be a little bit cheaper . Its about 36€ per person.
It includes audio guide to explain you every single thing in front of you!"
"December 23, 2021",5.0,Incredible! So beautiful,"Just WOW. The entrance fee is expensive (as are a lot of things in Barcelona), but it is worth every penny to see this stunning place - you will remember it forever. The audio guide is really immersive, it's a look into Gaudi's mind and way of thinking, not just boring facts and dates"
"December 22, 2021",5.0,One of my favourite places in Barcelona,"Amazing place to visit and admire Gaudi architectural style and the history behind the building. My mom has issues with stairs and they were very accommodating. The staff is super nice and they are well organized for the heavy amount of tourist going there every day. I loved the audio guide.
Yes, it is a crowded place because it is amazing, but totally worth the visit"
"December 19, 2021",5.0,"Great architecture, incredible!","Outstanding experience, must do everytime you visit Barcelona.
Amazing to travel into the Barcelona of the early 1900s when the industrialist family Batlo built this house.

The attraction itself is really expensive, close to 45 euros per person, but they give you back a good product."
"December 19, 2021",5.0,Amazed at how well the structures have been maintained,"So much to see, pictures have captured beautiful memories. Visited the Sagrada Familia several times. We had the opportunity to attend the Sunday Chapel service, It was an amazing experience. The Cable car ride, Big Bus city tours , Day passes were just perfect to see as much as we can."
"December 16, 2021",5.0,Amazing at night,Check it out with lights at night..what an amazing experience....could spend hours just looking at it
"December 1, 2021",5.0,Absolutely incredible,"I was simply amazed by this tour. I have been 8 times in Barcelona and for some reason i've always skipped Casa Batlló... Until now, tickets are a bit pricey but after visiting i can totally understand the pricing of a ticket. This is really a must! My favorite part was the 3D room at the end! I didn't even knew it was there when i booked. It was simply amazing. I also had the luxury that there was almost no people when i visited, so that made the experience even more incredible!"
"November 28, 2021",4.0,Popular and good choice... expensive...,"Very good choice...and a must see...

"November 28, 2021",5.0,Amazing,Visiting casa batlo was a very interesting experience. The architecture was something I have never seen. Very special! It is totally worth visiting.
"November 28, 2021",5.0,Casa Batllo,This is Antony Gaudi another master piece architect creation & must see while in Barcelona . it takes around 2 hours to see from inside. worth visit .
"November 21, 2021",5.0,Mesmerizing Work of Art!,The beauty of this building is overwhelming. It leaves the traveler daydreaming of what it was like to live in such a wonderful work of art. Truly Gaudi was a genius designer. I was in awe of this masterpiece.
"November 20, 2021",5.0,Worth it!,"Casa Battlo does not disappoint. The audio guide makes it so worthwhile to be able to spend as much time in any area as you wish. The architecture, the history of the building, the mosaics, the windows - I could go on and one. I purchased my ticket directly from Casa Battlo as it is on a main street with a Hop On Hop Off stop across the street."
"November 14, 2021",5.0,A must-visit Gaudi,"If you admire Gaudi architecture, you have to visit Casa Batllo. It is a most-do while in Barcelona. The audio-guide is fantastic. It tells a story and automatically starts the story as you enter each room. However, the EUR 36 ticket price is extremely exprensive. It can be cost prohibitive to many people, especially students. Please consider lowering your prices."
"November 12, 2021",1.0,You have to be rich to see those places,After being scammed for the price at the casa mila we just looked from outside. Cause ye that thing cost 40 Euro. More than twice the price of Versailles. Come on that's ridiculous. I didn't go inside but you need to be aware of the price before being disappointed. I spent less money in 2 days in Paris seeing some of the world wonders meanwhile here it would cost be almost 70 Euro to see 2 houses and the casa mila was under construction. Big big scam.
"November 6, 2021",5.0,Highlight of our trip,"We had a wonderful evening at Casa Batllo - we booked one of the Magic Nights tickets which included a 1 hour audio tour of the house, and then a 1 hour concert on the roof!

We had visited Casa Batllo about 10 years ago but the house still amazed us as it did the first time around, and the audio guide was very well done keeping your interest throughout the visit. There was so much to look at and the architecture is fascinating.

The concert on the rooftop really felt like a once in a lifetime experience - we chose the Gold ticket so had good seats, and it also included two glasses of cava each. On the evening we went we saw Luna Llena which is a guitar duo playing beautiful Spanish music along with two dancers performing flamenco - it really was a great evening with an amazing atmosphere.

At the end of the evening we through the 'Gaudi dome' which is a room where lights and pictures are projected on all surfaces of the room (including the ceiling and floor!) - again another amazing experience!

Although the tickets for the Magic Nights are not cheap (59 euro each) we felt it was such an amazing experience it was definitely worth the money - I would definitely recommend."
"November 1, 2021",1.0,Beautiful House. Horrible Elevator Music,"The house is beautiful.

But, the endless repetitive musac that blares from this building is terrible. I have no idea why the people who run the Casa Batllo feel fit to blast out the cacophony of distorted elevator music onto the Passeig de Gracia.. Their lack of concern for the neighborhood is akin to ghetto hood rats blasting c-Rap music from a hooptie.

The neighbors don't appreciate this violation at all."
"October 31, 2021",4.0,Beauty among craziness,"We did not pay to go in, but the building is very beautiful to just view from the outside. As the Gracia district is quite busy with shoppers and tourists alike, be prepared to deal with crowds."
"October 29, 2021",5.0,Fantastic exhibition and museum in one,"Good programe also with children presenting gaudi's mind, thinking, world, style in a modern way with a great extreem moovie and souvenir shop on the end of the audio guided tour."
"October 27, 2021",5.0,Stunning architecture,"This is a stunningly beautiful building, perhaps best seen at night, but don't miss out on a daytime visit to the interior.
The whole block (La Manzana de la Discordia) is of great architectural importance and worth visiting, containing buildings by Barcelona's greatest architects: Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Antoni Gaudí, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Enric Sagnier."
"October 23, 2021",5.0,Amazing building!,Great Gaudi architecture. Very good audio-guide that gives you some background to his work. Teenage children enjoyed the visit too!
"October 22, 2021",5.0,It is the building of color and light,"Every detail of the building is beautiful. I went there twice, first at night to see the exterior in the light. Then I went there in the tour. It is absolutely beautiful building"
"October 22, 2021",5.0,One of Gaudi's best!,"We love Casa Batllo! In 2019 we did a very cool nightime & concert experice with the excellent singer Gigi MacFarlane. I think it wsa the last concwrt before covid. Anyhoo we just came back for an afternoon visit and loved it. This place is so cool one of Gaudi's best. The nautical theme, colors, excellent craftsmanship and architecture (how can someone think up such vrceative spaces AND have it be so forward thinking from a functionality and light & air perspective?!). The rooftop bar is great for voew and a cava as well. Plus they added (?) a cool immersive light show at the end, very cool. Go!"
"October 21, 2021",5.0,Well worth a look,Tickets expensive but worth it . Numbers are limited which makes it easy to wander round and admire the building at leisure. Audio guide included in price was helpful . Beautiful architecture. Even our teenagers enjoyed it !
"October 19, 2021",5.0,genius Gaudi,"After seeing Sagrada Familia and Casa Mila, we walked to Casa batllo. When the tile art of Catalonia is combined with the mind of the genius Gaudi, the result is Casa Batllo! Gaudi was inspired to design here by bones and the human body. It is best to book tickets online for a home visit in advance."
"October 18, 2021",5.0,I loved this place,"I loved seeing a place like this, and experiencing the genius of Gaudi! It was worth the time. It made me appreciate the brilliance of this man."
"October 17, 2021",4.0,Beautiful architecture,"Located on a main shopping street, this is an outstanding
Gaudi representation. I didn't go in since the tickets were so expensive. I was told there was little to no furniture inside, so the outside is the best."

Spotted the wonderful exterior and stopped to admire it.

Didn't go inside due to the exorbitant cost."

"October 11, 2021",5.0,"Wow, words can’t describe…","So I must admit I didn’t know what to expect, but this is a true masterpiece in architecture. It was a bit pricey for the admission, and we probably wouldn’t have paid the gold entrance fee again for the free drink. But the work itself was a great two hour tour."
"October 10, 2021",5.0,Musical magical evening,"Casa Batllo Musical Evening programs are amazing. It combines a wonderful tour of the house with a rooftop concert. They offer a variety of programs. We chose Spanish guitar with flamenco dancing. These local artists are top talents. We enjoyed a wonderfully relaxed evening enjoying traditional Spanish music. If you’re visiting, go for unique opportunity. No better way to experience Barcelona!"
"October 9, 2021",1.0,Don’t Go!,"An overpriced, overcrowded rip-off.
Although Gaudi’s work on this building is amazing and theoretically well worth seeing, the gross over-commercialization of the building in the name of profit is a real turn-off.
During every step of the experience, you are channeled into a venue that is intended to sell you something. This is on top of the €36 per person admission price.
I adore Gaudi, but I would recommend you stick with the other venues that feature his work, including Parc Gruell and the Gruell Palace. Those venues are publicly- owned and fairly priced. They are also much less crowded."
"October 4, 2021",5.0,Absolutely fantastic!,So surreal and gorgeous. Absolutely loved this and the audio guide was very nice. My number 2 best thing to do in Barcelona after Sagrada Familia.
"October 4, 2021",1.0,Only ok,"Only ok

"September 19, 2021",5.0,Magic Nights - Entry & Concert,"We booked the ‘magic nights’ tour with evening concert. It’s great to see around this beautifully designed housemaid hear the history of it. The audio guide is detailed, a little lengthy at times but it’s self guided so you can listen to as much or as little as you like. The concert was a great end to a lovely visit, the singer that evening was Gigi Mcfarlane alongside a saxophonist and they were both fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed the show along with our glasses of cava."

"August 30, 2021",5.0,Amazing casa,Great experience and hard to believe that this house was built years and years ago. Beautiful colours and architecture. The audio visual feature was the perfect accompaniment. Have to see it to appreciate it. It's so worthwhile.
"August 30, 2021",4.0,Casa Batillo,The house itself is amazing. Architecturally speaking it Gaudí was ahead of his time in thinking up the design. I could’ve done without the electric music and weird intro which is reminiscent of something Disney would do in its theme parks. Less is more people
"August 26, 2021",5.0,Must see...Just fabulous: do not miss!,"Such improvements in few years! A master house of Gaudi you have to visit , even with kids! The 10D experience is amazing from the beg to the and the rooftop bar is a great idea:)
AMZING"
"August 25, 2021",5.0,Awesome experience,Right from the start it was great and I’d recommend it. With the new 10 D experience ( headphones provided at the start ) it was really awesome. Every part and every detail of the building was explained very well.
"August 24, 2021",5.0,Book the Magic Night (including 10D experience) you won’t regret it!,"I booked the Magic Night including the 10D experience and it was absolutely fantastic! I loved wandering through the house and it was so nice that they had all kinds of languages available for the headsets. The house itself was breathtaking and the 10D experiences at the end and beginning were so surprising and amazing. I also absolutely loved the rumba live music at the rooftop. The view was stunning, the music SO good and the overal ambiance was amazing. And the cava tasted pretty good as well. It was a beautiful performance and I felt so happy sitting there on the rooftop. I really recommend it to ANYONE who goes to Barcelona. I mean I didn’t know much about Gaudí but this was so worth it!"
"August 23, 2021",5.0,Stunning,"If you visit one thing in Barcelona, make it here. Mind-blowing experience, such a great property, we loved it, our 12yr old daughter wanted to go back the next day.....and the 3D experience at the end is incredible."
"August 14, 2021",5.0,Amazing,Beautiful architecture. It's mind blowing to think that this house was a private home. It must have been a child's dream. All the details and beauty that went in are astounding. A true work of art turned into a home.

"August 9, 2021",5.0,Splendid Gaudi building,This is a tremendous building and a must see in Barcelona. Gaudi is at his most colorful and imaginative here. The house is so intricately designed including the furniture that it astounds the senses. His theme of being under the sea is on all floors of this home. The roof is the story of St. George and the dragon. This is a reference to the Catalonian Independence fervor of the late 19th century. as St. George was the patron saint of this area. The tiles and floors are exquisite. There is a new virtual area at the beginning and end of the tour which is very different in many colors and sounds. It is a great half day experience.
"August 8, 2021",5.0,Wonderful Thing to do in Barcelona,Very well thought out self guided tour in multiple languages. Beautiful home and unique experience. Crowds are very well controlled. A highlight in Barcelona.
"August 1, 2021",4.0,A must see in Barcelona,"This is a must do in Barcelona, however they should inform people that the famous balcony photo is not allowed because of Covid. Highly disappointing!!!!! We lost the audio twice with the headphones and they were too tight. Overall though, it is beautiful. Happy I paid 17.50 euros as we are residents. I think 35 euro is steep."
"July 14, 2021",5.0,One of a kind,Casa Batlló is one of a kind. Gaudí really gets to create nature with his art. Can be compared to Machu Pichu or Pyramids of Egypt. Just incredible!
"July 10, 2021",1.0,At 39 Euro absolutely not worth the visit.,"The entrance price of 39 Euro at the gates and 35 Euro on the website, makes a visit absolutely not worth the price. Besides wearing a mask indoors during summer months makes visiting this place uncomfortable,"
"July 6, 2021",5.0,Expensive but worth it,"It is expensive, but it is unlike anything else you will see. there is an audio guide as part of the ticket that does not require any thought. The headphones somehow know where you are at all times and tells you when to move on and can tell once you have moved on incase you take longer or need to stop for any reason. The guide shares a ton of information and really helps you understand what you are seeing and what to be looking for/at throughout the entire tour. The amount of detail, thought and understanding that went into the design is hard to fathom."

"June 1, 2021",4.0,Worth seeing but expensive,"WE really loved seeing the inside of this quirky, interesting house. The audio guide is good and it was a worthwhile visit. The entrance fee however is too much, it was over 60 euros for two (the only tickets available) and I think it was overpriced - especially as it was quite busy and so difficult to socially distance in some of the passageways and rooms.
Worth seeing but not good value."

"November 30, 2020",4.0,Another Great Art by Gaudi,"Casa Batllo- another jaw-dropping work of Antoni Gaudi. All his masterpieces are so different, you cannot pick just one or two..."
"November 28, 2020",5.0,An amazing building,"Another incredible building designed by Gaudi. There does not seem to be a straight line anywhere and the whole interior curves and swirls around you. Everything has been thought of down to the last detail, including the flat numbers and window frames. Definitely worth a visit."
"September 26, 2020",4.0,No balcony picture because of Covid19,"Very beautiful, especially now that there are very few visitors. The digital smart guide with extended reality is really cool. If you go with a baby you should wear it in a sling since the elevator does not reach the top.
But there is a big negative point: a whole floor was closed, the one with the balcony you can take a really nice picture on normally. I really wanted that picture and they should at least inform beforehand that they close a part of the experience. By the way, without reducing the entry price. The reason was that there are too less visitors. I did not understand that argument."
"September 5, 2020",5.0,Gaudi's top,"One of the must go places in Barcelona. Book your tickets online to avoid lines. The visit lasts one of two hours and there are toilets, a souvenir shop and a bar on in the roof terrace.
They provide you a cell phone at the entrance for virtual reality experience in the different rooms."
"August 13, 2020",5.0,Choosing Which Gaudi Buildings to Visit…,"Unless you have unlimited time, most people have to bite the bullet and narrow down which of Gaudi’s incredible works to visit. This was our first trip to Barcelona and we decided to get tickets for Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia and see Casa Battlo from the outside only. The Park and Sagrada Familia still remain the two best things we did in Barcelona.
One afternoon we walked along Passeig Gracia to have a look at Casa Battlo and the other houses that make up the “Block of Discord”. We didn't go into any of them but it was very easy to see Casa Battlo, Casa Amatller and Casa Mila at the same time because they are very close together.
Gaudi was commissioned by Josep Batlló in 1904 to redesign an existing building. We could see the house very clearly from the street. There are no walls or buildings in front of it so you get a completely unobstructed view. I thought it was best seen from the opposite side of the road first so you got an overall impression before seeing the details up close.

CLASSIC GAUDI HIGHLIGHTS:
1. TRENCARDIS: The façade is fairy-tale beautiful. There are lustrous glazed tiles and coloured ceramics and fragments of glass which create an amazing fantasy of a house. Using broken tiles, stones, marble and glass was a favourite Gaudí technique, called ‘trencardis’. From further away, it looks as if the entire face of the house is covered in a pattern of the prettiest blossoms. Then, as you get closer you can see the individual shards of blue, green, red/orange and purple tiles that make up the mosaic patterning.
2. NATURE: Another Gaudi technique was to use natural, organic forms and motifs drawn from nature. The longer you look, the more you see. There are floral patterns, animal shapes, vine-like curves and suggestions of bone and skeleton.
3. BALCONIES: These are just the strangest feature. There’s no other way to describe them. It’s hard to know what to make of them. Are they skulls? Masks? Or maybe the heads of bugs? Gaudi never explained his work but you can see why it’s sometimes called the Casa dels Ossos (House of Bones). Again, it was very Gaudi-like to use shapes drawn from the natural world. The balcony at the very top is a little different and looks more like a lotus flower.
5. DRAGON SCALE TILES: The roof can also be partially seen from the street. The scaly looking tiles make it look one a giant reptile or dragon’s back. There is a popular theory that the roof is based on Saint George killing the dragon with his sword to save the princess and the people from the animal’s wrath. In this case, the roof tower is the sword stuck in the dragon’s back and the bone-shapes below represent his victims. 
6. RELIGION: Look at any of Gaudi’s buildings and you will see recurring religious imagery. From the street, you can see the a four-pointed transverse cross at the very top of the tower, a classic Gaudí signature

TIPS:
1. See Gaudi’s apartment block, Casa Mila, at the same time. They are only minutes away from each other on the Passeig de Gracia.
3. Casa Ametller is right next door. It was designed at the same time (but not by Gaudi, which means that it doesn't get the same attention). It is free to walk into the lobby and through to the café where we had a hot chocolate
2. Go earlier in the day if you can. We went in the afternoon around 3pm when the sun was behind the house and the lighting was a little dull. It would probably have looked even better when the tiles were catching the sun earlier in the day.
2. We ran out of time to go back at night but I would have liked to as it is illuminated and looks very dramatic.
4. Passeig Gracia is lined with high-end shops. We saved Casa Battlo for an afternoon when we wanted to do a bit of shopping also.

COST: The entry price is rather hefty but it is worth noting that both Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia are similarly priced. Casa Battlo starts at €25. Otherwise, Palau Guell, one of Gaudi’s much earlier buildings, is a little more budget-friendly (€12) and has free entry on the first Sunday of the month."
"August 4, 2020",4.0,Excellent Historic building,"Very impressive and artistic architecture given the time when it was built.

There is always a crowd there, so plan and research in advance to avoid frustrations and disappointments.

Don't forget to drop by for refreshments and snacks across the street in one of the many eateries. Great food there."
"July 26, 2020",5.0,great place for tourist,too many people but if you dont mind huge crowd then it s for you ...i think from the outside it s enough many other things in Barcelona if you are there for a short time
"July 21, 2020",4.0,Lovely Casa Batllo,"We queued for this attraction at 4.30pm on weekend of 11/12th July. We worked our way through the casa and it was maybe unsurprisingly sparse. All are provided with a tour with headphones in respective language. We did take a few photos and really enjoyed our time here. It was rather expensive to get in (the most expensive of all of our visits to attractions but worth it I think as a) I really wanted to see it and b) the fee is used to upkeep the venue.

When inside the casa we saw the queue forming and felt glad that we visited early and had the place to ourselves and was able to really to soak in the atmosphere of the building."
"July 20, 2020",4.0,Great Gaudi,"In contrast to Gaudi’s other building La Pedrera, we found Casa Batlo to be extremely interesting both inside and out. We must have spent 15 minutes just looking at the facade from the pavement; it is like something from a fairy tale. Inside, the excellent audio guide talked us through each of the rooms and floors to the rooftop, explaining different aspects of the architecture and the natural lighting."
"July 5, 2020",4.0,Do not miss it.,"I am from the city and have been to this building multiple times.
The ticket is 'pricey' but 100% worth it. Also, please note that this building does NOT receive any funds from the taxes or government therefore, it relies solely on the tickets they sell for any restoration, reconstruction, etc. which are very expensive.
It represents so much of our culture both socially and culturally (in architecture). Nothing like it anywhere else in the world. If I was able to visit only 1, the Pedrera or this building, I would go to this building, hands down.
Unfogerttable.

Something I would encourage Casa Batllo to reconsider: their guiding. Please allow for some real-person guides. This building deserves something better than the audio and the virtual turtles, etc. We are not all children and this building needs a step up in quality re this service. Look at other entities with solid service like the National Gallery, la Casa Vicens...It can do much better there."
"July 1, 2020",3.0,Nice place if you need something to do.,"It is interesting but a bit boring for me.
No line when we went in February.
This was before the virus hit there.
Good walk or you can taxi or Metro."
"June 30, 2020",5.0,Loved it,"It was great experience to do with my friends. We all love Gaudí and La Casa Batlló was amazing to see, specially the inside but the outside is very stunning."
"June 29, 2020",5.0,Must go,"免排隊票價不算便宜，但還是買了好一點

Definitely a place to take pictures, better go early so not too many people to fight for the Selfie spot, got to say it is the building itself is Art.
really really cool and feel like in a colourful dream , it was quite fascinating ^^

Again, book tickets in advance. Save you time is important as a tourist who only stay 4-5 days in the city."
"May 28, 2020",5.0,Amazing builgind !,"The inside is as amazing as the outside of the building. If you are a fan of Gaudi. it is a must see, especially if you are an art lover... AMAZING !"
"May 13, 2020",5.0,A beautiful house worth the visit,"Admission to Casa Batlló is expensive, as is everything in Barcelona. Of all the attractions, this was the one I liked the most. The architecture is full of curves and colors, and every corner of the house has some detail that delights you. The problem is that it is always crowded ... But don't miss it!"
"April 23, 2020",4.0,Unlike Any Other House,"From the minute you see the house, you can tell it was created by Gaudi. It was incredible. I am not usually even interested in extensive architecture, but this place was unreal! Each room had such a great story behind it. The only reason I marked it down a star was because I think it was expensive for a tour of a house, even if it was created by Gaudi."
"April 12, 2020",3.0,Casa Battlo,"This is one of the best known of Gaudi’s houses and becomes very busy and overcrowded even though numbers are limited. It is expensive to go in and you may have to book in advance, but it’s still worth seeing, especially at night when the fabulous exterior is lit. The quieter areas like the laundry corridor and back stairs are the most memorable elements for me. There is quite an aggressive photographer pushing you to have your photo taken up on the roof and a large gift shop.
There are many alternative Gaudi sites that are a nicer experience."
"April 10, 2020",5.0,Stunning,One unique building downtown where once again Gaudi left his mark!!! Just stunning. We didn't get inside because of lack of time but it's amazing from the outside as well.
"April 4, 2020",5.0,Early entry pass is worth it!,"I HIGHLY recommend this early entry option. It is totally worth the extra $$.

I was amazed at how I could get a full panoramic shot in one room (with no people in the photo!!) This was truly a luxury. We entered right around 8, and I noticed right when they opened the doors at 9, the place was flooded with people. I was so thankful to be able to walk around and take my time in each space, looking at the details and not moving with a crowd of tourists. Overall, this is an architectural work of art by Gaudí. I was taken aback by all the beautiful design and detail. And, as part of your admission, you have an audio guide that takes you through the space with all kids of fun facts and information.

If you’re someone looking for good photo opportunities, I definitely recommend this early entry pass. Worth it!!!"
"April 4, 2020",5.0,Absolutely stunning building,"I booked this a couple of weeks in advance just to be on the safe side (cost £43.00 for 2 adults), not knowing much about the place other than its fascinating appearance I asked a guide if she recommended going and was surprised to hear that if you see the outside that is all you really need.

To say I disagree is an understatement, sure the outside is remarkable, but going inside the building has so much to offer with each room showing amazing lines and layouts. The audio guide adds to the experience and is a little more than just audio, putting animations around the room and adding furniture as you look at the screen.

I can't recommend this enough and just us going here inspired us to go the next day to Casa Mila to take in more of this geniuses work."
"April 2, 2020",5.0,Surreal Place,"In other opportunity (without my sons) I visited inside the building and was very interesting, but the most amazing of this work of art is the frontage, with the masks/balconies, the changing of colors and tones with the lights at night."
"March 30, 2020",5.0,OMG - I waited for this for years and wasn't disappointed,"Absolutely WOW! My 3rd visit to Barcelona and this time Gaudi's Casta Batllo was at the top of the list. Well researched we booked early afternoon, a time that was not so busy and the sun light is at an optimum to show this magnificent work of art to it's best.
I'd forgotten just how detailed the exterior of the building was and the interior certainly did not disappoint.
I am a huge Gaudi fan and after a disappointing visit to Park Guell which is under huge repairs, my faith was restored.
My advice is to take your time, when it's manic, take a minute and the crowd will disperse enough to get those special photos and enjoy the master's work.
The ticket we had also have us access to the Salon - I hadn't been aware of this and we very nearly missed it - that is a lovely, more conventional space where you can dress up in period costume and get a free photo."
"March 23, 2020",5.0,This Gaudi Art Nouveaux masterpiece will make you smile at every turn,"Casa Battlo is truly one of Gaudi’s Catalan Art Nouveaux masterpieces. His organic style was inspired by nature and is totally magical. We took an audio tour with an amazing device that not only gave us descriptions and history of what we were seeing, but also the ability to see (virtually) the furnishings and the overall look of each room, as it appeared when the Battlo family lived here. (There was no real furniture in the house.) The initial staircase wound up to the 1st floor in typical Gaudi style—no straight lines. We passed through a reception room decorated in brilliant golds, with a small mushroom-shaped cubby on one side containing a fireplace with benches on either side—presumably for “chaperoned” visits with the daughters of the house. Beautiful honey-colored, art deco-style carved doors (with upper transoms of stained glass in blue, green, yellow, and rose-violet) led to a sitting room and then to the main living room facing the street. It had an expansive three-coved set of windows with intricately carved frames and magnificent multi-colored glass. They were surrounded by pillars and domes of plaster reminiscent of a Tolkein hobbit house. Opposite the windows there had been a huge chest that opened into an altar when the family wanted to pray. The house was not just a work of art, but also an engineering masterpiece. Gaudi included a large central double shaft that opened all the way from the ground floor to the roof skylights to allow air and light to filter down. Rooms on upper levels had beautiful, uniquely-shaped stained-glass windows opening onto the central light shaft. Windows on lower floors were larger (to let in more light), while those higher up were smaller (since they were closer to the light source). A series of slats that could be opened or closed to regulate the air flow was installed under each window. The shaft was tiled in blue—darker blue on the highest level and gradually fading to lighter blue on lower floors to make the whole shaft appear to be the same color. Passing through the family dining room (much like the living room), we found ourselves in a beautiful garden courtyard, with mosaic sculptures, fountains, floors, and walls—all covered with multi-colored broken tile and glass pieces. The back façade of the house had wonderful curved balconies with flower pots, grillwork, and a fanciful frieze of colorful flowers and shapes. Back into the house and up the stairs, we finally reached the attic level with beautiful rib-arched hallways and the rooms used for laundry and storage. Climbing the small spiral staircase, we emerged on the rooftop to find the most spectacular views of the surrounding city and the most breathtaking mosaic sculptures of all. Each chimney was a fanciful work of art. There was also a colorful dragon—or at least part of him (the spine and tail) and a beautiful cross. Exiting through the gift shop, we also got to see a number of original chairs designed by Gaudi. It was an amazing tour!"
"March 22, 2020",4.0,"Not cheap, but defintely worth a visit","Most unusual place, defintely worth visiting. The roof expecially good. If you want ot see some of what Gaudi achieved go there. Ps, cheaper if you book online"
"March 18, 2020",5.0,Beautiful,This house build by Antoni Gaudi is a beautiful piece of architecture. In every season the house is changing in colours. Sometimes with flowers and sometimes with colourful lights. Strongly recommend everyone to see this house when you are in Barcelona!
"March 18, 2020",5.0,"Beautiful, whimsical, magical house",Amazing! It's like journey through a magical dream! Dragon landing on top of the roof? Ocean water interior? Knight in armor chimney? Customized room door with secret alphabet system? Be amazed by the creativity and imagination of Gaudi. I think this must be among the top of his works. The audio guide is quite interesting and incorporated some virtual reality as part of the introduction to the house. A must visit in Barcelona!
"March 17, 2020",4.0,Amazing,We didn’t go inside we are not much of a admiral of architecture. But it is cool to see this piece of art in the middle of a busy shopping avenue.
"March 15, 2020",5.0,More than I expected,"After hitting several other Gaudi sites, I wasn't expecting Batllo to impress, but it is worth the stop. The house is deceptively massive and an enviable home showcasing Gaudi's attention to detail in this commissioned residence."
"March 14, 2020",5.0,Wow,"This was the attraction I was looking forward to the most in Barcelona and it didn’t disappoint. The architecture was astounding. Something that you’ll never see anywhere else, I’m so glad we visited!"
"March 13, 2020",5.0,Colourfully weird,"We visited this after visiting the Segrada Familia which gave us the two sides of Gaudi. It is hard to comprehend the two completely different sides and styles of Gaudi.

We paid at the door and got the audio guide which was a great assistance. It was also interactive and showed what the inside was like in its heyday.

To say it’s fantastically weird is and understatement. It’s a colourful building, parts of it going under conservation. You simply let your imagination runaway with you.

There are stairs leading to the rooftop as well as a lift.

It is an amazing building, well worth visiting and very colourful."
"March 11, 2020",5.0,Gaudi At His Best,We visited the Casa Batllo structure during a trip to Baccelona last year. We had heard about Antoni Gaudi and his unique architectural skills and were interested in seeing some of his work. Casa Batllo is one of them and we were very impressed. The tour of the mulit-level facility is indeed a unique experience and should not be missed if you are ever in Barcelona. We truly enjoyed our time visiting this unique Gaudi structure.THe truly pushed the architectural envelop.
"March 11, 2020",4.0,Neat Experience,Self guided tour of a very interesting house. It was nice to have the audio guide to help explain everything we were seeing.
"March 10, 2020",5.0,Amazing building,"One of the best work of Gaudi, that's for sure! Every room is so different from the other and yet in the same style. This house is very much inspired by the sea creatures. If you visit it, you will get a device with headphones - enjoy the tour! The audio guide was with augmented reality so you could see things moving around in every room."
"March 10, 2020",5.0,very GAUdi,"It speaks for itself. Color full building , you would not miss it. Stained glass when the sun strikes put a smile on you."
"March 10, 2020",4.0,Great architectural beauty,The beautifully planned architectural beauty is spectacular. It takes you back in time when it was inhabited by one of the great bussiness man of Italy.
"March 10, 2020",5.0,Casa Batllo,It was a excellent and rewarding experience. The staff were helpful the cortuos. My trip to Barcelona was to see Gaudi's creation. It was more satisfying and rewarding.
"March 9, 2020",5.0,Escape in the mind of Antoni Gaudi,"A must when in Barcelona! Im
No architect but I was most certainly captivated and intrigued by this creative genius. Went in March and didn’t have to wait at all to in."
"March 9, 2020",4.0,"Good, but can't imagine how busy must be in summer","This was a great attraction. Visited using the Barcelona Card so it was 'free'. Arrived just before 9 and there was a queue of only a handful of people. Easy entry, given an audio/ video guide which was really informative. Lots of photo ops, but even with the small (?) number of people visiting at this time of year, it still took a while to get clear shots.

Watch out at the local metro, Passeig de Gracia, as it seems to be a pickpocketing hotspot. Only just managed to stop some little scumbag from stealing my phone out of my pocket as I left the station."
"March 9, 2020",5.0,Self Guided Tour of Interesting House,"The house itself is super interesting and shows the mind of Gaudi, I'm glad we were here first as a background to the Sangrada Familia."
"March 9, 2020",5.0,Great place to visit,We truly loved this building. The tiles and Windows are all quite unusual. We paid for a silver ticket so that entitled us to visit the private hall. We were also given complimentary small bottles of water.
"March 9, 2020",5.0,Interesting and cultural,"Great audio guide, very interesting. All of the elements you have to see to believe how beautiful and clever they are. Gives you the background info and reasoning behind the madness of this place. Only negative is that it is Quite pricy for a couple of hours visit."

"March 8, 2020",5.0,Magnificent!,Really amazing. A masterpiece in every detail. Do visit this fairytale house. The audioguide was well composed and luckily tha house was not too crowded.
"March 7, 2020",5.0,Self guided tour,rooftop so be prepared for that. The home is very interesting and offers insight into Gaudi's work as well as great photo opportunities. Well worth the visit which took approx 1 hour. There is a nice gift shop inside as well.
"March 7, 2020",5.0,Enjoyable visit,The building is really impressive and the smart guide is good as you get to hear about the interesting facts in respect of the house. Gaudí was such an amazing creator and we especially loved the courtyard and rooftop where he had even made the chimneys fit in with the design of the house. Well worth a visit
"March 7, 2020",5.0,Peak of Gaudi Design,"We visited late morning and had a short wait in the queue. It is pricy to get in but we decided overall it was worth it.
Good spoken and pictorial guide included in the entry fee, informative and interesting.
We spent a good two hours there and it completed our overall picture of the work of Gaudi.
Yes, worth a visit if you are interested in the work of Gaudi."
"March 6, 2020",5.0,Dreamy experience with a rooftop view and music to top off the evening with friends.,"I didn't know exactly what to expect. It was so impressive, the house, Gaudi. What an imagination! This tour makes you realize this artist had the opportunity to do whatever his imagination imagined. Beautifully designed furnishings to the tours projections of sea creatures and underwater views floating from floor to ceiling. A bonus is a picture at the end. Very nice. The music rooftop was a jazz singer, lovely. And a glass of cava! A memorable evening shared with friends."
"March 6, 2020",4.0,Strange but interesting!,Recently visited Casa Batllo. I found it strange but very interesting at the same time. Some of the features were way ahead of their time and the use of natural light was fantastic. The smart guide was useful. Recommended.
"March 5, 2020",5.0,Amazing place!,This was one of my favourite Gaudi stops. The stained glass and overall design is just fabulous! Really gave an insight into his appreciation of colour and nature. Take time to really take in the details.
"March 4, 2020",5.0,Artwork,Without a doubt the most beautiful work of art I've seen in my life. I recommend visiting. Better to have audioguide to understand it.
"March 4, 2020",4.0,Worth Going Inside,"We were definitely hesitant about going inside because of the cost, but decided to do it anyway and are glad that we did. The inside does not disappoint compared to the outside. I really enjoyed the smart guide which enables you to look around the room through the device and see how it was decorated and creatively highlights some of the shapes that are based in nature."
"March 4, 2020",4.0,Architectural giant,"Gaudi architecture is the important must see destintation in Barcelona, and top them with Casa Batllo.
Little expensive, but impressive.
A view from the outside itself i great."
"March 3, 2020",5.0,Stunning design,Before visiting Casa Batllo I didn't know very much about Gaudi design. I was blown away by the detail of the design throughout this very large home (basically the size of a small apartment building). Well worth the visit. Very glad we visited Casa Batllo before visiting Sagrada Familia as it was a great way to learn more about Gaudi before seeing the master piece.
"March 3, 2020",5.0,Fabtastic,The tour was wonderful and easy with the self guided phones -easy and very professional-loved this tour -it is my second time
"March 3, 2020",1.0,Disappointing,We went to visit this place but was put off by the excessive entry fees and decided that a view from outside would suffice.
"March 2, 2020",5.0,Impressive imagination,I lived quite near from it and passed by few times daily.Very many people were waiting to enter inside.Im satisfied with outside view.Very impressive and not standard
"March 2, 2020",4.0,Creativity!,"Enjoyed visiting an architectural masterpiece. Definitely worth an hour of time. Tix are cheaper If buying online. VR technology is cool with the audio. If you like architecture, worth the visit."
"February 29, 2020",3.0,Stunning but ridiculously expensive,Extortionately expensive. Beautiful building but far far too expensive (€102 for two adults and a teenager - and that was with an online discount !). Audio was quite difficult to use. Cannot recommend it - purely because of price 😢
"February 29, 2020",5.0,"Very, very interesting!","It might be a bit on the expensive side, but you get a lot of information on the self guided auditour whilst making your way around this incredible building. If you don't know much about Gaudi you certainly will by the time you leave here!"
"February 29, 2020",5.0,Don’t miss this and get the gold ticket,We paid a few € extra to get the gold pass. You can get blue silver or gold basically. Gold means you get in first and you get some time to yourself. So so worth the extra. We had rooms to ourselves and could get photos with no one in. We can back at the end when everyone had been let in and you then have 20 people in a room. This place is simply stunning. The attention to detail is incredible. The terrace at the top give your a couple of amazing photos while the regular floors give you stunning woodwork and tile work. This place is a must see for me. Amazing.
"February 27, 2020",5.0,City Break,"We had a Gaudi day during our stay and the Casa Batllo was one of the highlights. Very immersive audio tour, we booked the Gold Tour, which we thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to anyone."
"February 25, 2020",5.0,Stunning Building,"We spent almost no time in line waiting to get into the Casa Batllo. Once in, we received our headsets and we were kept informed along the way. There is so much to see and learn inside the house with beautiful views abound. Highly recommend checking this place out on your visit to Barcelona."
"February 25, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"Casa Batlo is amazing, it is very busy but well worth visiting.
Gaudi was absolutely brilliant.
Buy your tickets in advance, we bought blue and had no wait to get in."
"February 24, 2020",5.0,Amazing,Went to Casa Batilo late in the afternoon. There was a couple of different options for entrance price wise. We chose the cheapest which was 20 euro each. Headset included. I loved walking around this building. Gaudi was a genius & his work on this building was just simply stunning. We opted for an extra near the end of the tour for a photo for 12.00 euro. This was taken on the balcony by a photographer & was worth it.
"February 24, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"As Gaudi Fan I couldn’t miss casa batllo .
We took the early access ticket and we were very happy With the tour. The place is simply amazing !"
"February 24, 2020",5.0,Incredible!,Book the early access ticket for less crowds and optimal photos. The details are so though out and every thing also has an architectural purpose. It’s a must-see!
"February 24, 2020",4.0,Nice building,Is a nice place to visit when you visit Barcelona because is in the city center. I really had a good time there. Easy to get there with tram and metro bus.
"February 24, 2020",5.0,Take the tour of the Cast Batilo,"The inside is as amazing as the outside of the building. If you are a fan of Gaudi, or not, it is a must see especially if you are an art lover."
"February 23, 2020",4.0,"Cool interior, but the La Pedrera roof is way better.","We liked being able to see more of the interior as opposed to La Pedrera; however, the roof was a bit disappointing. It was nothing special compared to La Pedrera. If you were wondering about choosing between the two, I'd pick La Pedrera. We had the time so we decided to see what the inside was like of Casa Batllo. The view of the Sagrada Familia is blocked by a building."
"February 23, 2020",4.0,Interesting building,"We pre-booked tickets to Casa Batllo for an evening visit, which included a rooftop concert. This is a great way to see Gaudi at his best. Very unusual, but truly ahead of its time, architecture. You can meander through the different rooms of this very interesting building at your own pace using the accompanying audio tour provided though the headphones. If you like Gaudi, and something a little different, this is worth a visit.
The rooftop concert was very relaxed and Gisela Novais was really good, she engaged with the audience well and has a great voice that suited the rhythm and blues repetoire of easy listening. A great night out."
"February 22, 2020",5.0,Fascinating building.,Has to be seen to be believed. Flanked by regular straight edged buildings it looks like it was dreamt up and plopped in. You could stare for hours just taking it in as each bit looks different. Worth a look as you meander through Barcelona’s streets.
"February 22, 2020",5.0,Casa Batllo,"Amazing place, Gaudi is a genius, his architecture is stunning and extremely clever. I can’t wait to go back for another visit. I did the Gold ticket where you get to go into Gaudi’s private rooms and have an old fashioned photo taken. It was well worth the visit."
"February 22, 2020",5.0,Last minute addition and so glad we did it!,We had a free morning and decided to visit since this was super close to the apartment and the outside was so pretty. I am so glad we toured inside - this ended up being my favorite of all the Gaudi spots beating Park Guell and Sagrada Família. I loved the audio tour and so did my 3 teens/tweens. It kept them engaged the whole time and they took their time in each room. We tried to buy tickets on line (definitely do this so you don’t have to wait and it was cheaper) but the online tickets didn’t go through must have been a glitch on their site however we asked and they gave us the cheaper online price. So glad we did this tour - loved all the color and the picture at the end was one of my favorite souvenirs of the trip!
"February 22, 2020",5.0,Interesting place,Easily accessible with a fast track pass - straight in to collect our headphones and English explanation of the wonderful building. Spectacular interiors well worth a visit.
"February 21, 2020",5.0,Bones and skulls,The house of bones fascinated all the family especially our 14 year old grandson who learned a lot to share with his classmates after half-term!
"February 21, 2020",4.0,Another of Gaudis masterpiece in the city center.,Another architectural wonder made by Antonio Gaudi. You should not miss Gaudi's architecture in Barcelona as its one of its kind in the world.
"February 21, 2020",5.0,Not to be Missed,"This house tour is not to be missed and worth every penny. We purchased tickets online standing outside approx €25 per person (with headset). Gaudi's architecture is well ahead of time, how something can be old yet modern at the same time begs belief. You will not be dissappointed."
"February 21, 2020",5.0,Very nice,The architecture is different.Is something that you don’t see everyday...is definitely the most interesting hous I have see

"February 20, 2020",5.0,Amazing House of the Sea,"Gaudi designed this house with elements that represented the sea. It is unique and amazing to see. Used the audio guide, which was enough information. Plan time to just soak in the details of his work in the design, and you will not be sorry. A definite must with a visit to Barcelona, and only a short walk from his other house La Pedrera, so easily done on the same day."
"February 19, 2020",5.0,Casa Batllo,"Magnifique villa of Gaudi, wonderful architecture , just unique in Barcelona, I love this style romantique; a must to visit ."
"February 18, 2020",3.0,Not well maintained,"As we didn't purchase the tickets in advance, it was nice to discover no queues on a February afternoon.
The audio guide tries to fill in the gaps, by displaying some firnishings etc, as the house itself is completely bare.
It clearly once was a fabulous home, but the current maintenance does it little justice. From broken skirtings, to faded woodwork and some damaged walls, the building is sadly not looking its best.
The entry charge is steep, and no concessions (which makes it a very dear experience with 3 children in tow). There are further attempts to make you part with even more money, as entry to some areas is an extra €10 (yes, children are chareged too), and a photo opportunity, which could be nice,starts at €12 a pic(though the pgotographer assured me it would be only €6). Again, I would have been happier to support the conservation of this interesting structure had it been treated better."
"February 18, 2020",5.0,A must see!,"I feel truly blessed to have visited Casa Batllo. The audio guide was great and I was very pleasantly surprised with the level of access granted to visitors.
Superb!!"
"February 18, 2020",5.0,Excellent!,I loved it! The windows were so exquisitely beautiful. The audio description was well done. Gaudi was truly a genius. I had seen the outside of his masterpieces in the past. It is well worth it to pay the extra to get inside and truly experience his works.
"February 17, 2020",4.0,"Exceptional architecture, perfectly maintained","This is a fascinating insight into Gaudi. The audioguide (included in the price of admission) is very informative, and takes you through the entire house explaining his thoughts and plans. It also has a visual component which help to appreciate each component, with animations for how it once was - especially good to keep children’s attention. Staff nice. Nice gift shop too. Well worth 1-2 hours. Ticket queue super long , so make sure you book. As ever, early entrance means crowds much less."
"February 16, 2020",5.0,A fascinating insight in to Gaudi’s work.,"This incredible building is well worth a visit, I’ve been twice now, there’s so much to take in with every twist and turn within this incredible creation, fantastic views from the roof top gardens too, allow at least 2 hours for your visit."
"February 15, 2020",5.0,Get an audio guide; very helpful,"The building and architecture are fascinating and incredible, even if you're not into architecture. I don't always get audio guides, but I would definitely recommend getting one for Casa Batllo. Tons of rooms to explore, as well as the rooftop. The temperature inside the building was somewhat hot and stuffy, and it was very crowded which almost made me bring my overall rating down to a 4. We were there about 1.5 hours. It has an elevator if needed or lots of steps for good excercise."
"February 15, 2020",4.0,Fascinating,"Interesting and fascinating as expected, you hope to see more and more every step you take. If you do not take a super priced tour you feel you haven't seen enough. It's an investment, I think it became too expensive. It's expensive to maintain it clearly, but still.
It's worth visiting, it's a good option to experience history in town."
"February 14, 2020",4.0,Loved the architecture,We really enjoyed visiting Casa Batllo. Going at just the right time lets the sun come in and illuminate certain parts of the museum. You can go all the way up to the terrace and see the views (and more of Gaudis art). We had our daughter with us in a stroller. There is an elevator but it is a VERY tight squeeze. Make sure to purchase tickets beforehand to avoid the lines because they stretch outside of the building.
"February 14, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"Can't imagine the mind of Gaudi! Beautiful tour with electronics that show the rooms as they were furnished originally. Well done, very nice staff."
"February 13, 2020",5.0,Gaudi's masterpiece to discover.,"This is another Gaudi's buildings worth to discover. It's a smaller building than La Pedrera but for me it's even more beautiful. Moreover you have right beside this building another important city landmark: Casa Amatller, Built by another famous architect. It's curious to see how different are those buildings to each other."
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Gaudi architecture is amazing!,"Get the audio tour for this because they have it set up with video of what the rooms in the house looked like at the time. Very creative way to see the exhibit. The details in the architecture are whimsical and beautiful. Must be experienced. Highly recommend. With all destinations like this, you should get your tickets in advance online. This will save you standing in long lines or even being dissapointed that they have sold out. We always reserved in advance and were happy we did."
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Another Gaudi Masterpiece,"A dream home. Unique, bright, cheerful, functional. I suggest getting the ""Early Morning"" tickets online. It was worth the extra cost. We were there before opening and already a lineup."
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Fantastic interactive tour,"We arrived at 9.30am with our pre-booked tickets and went straight in. This was a good time to go as it seemed to get busier as we were leaving around an hour or so later.
We were given our headset and smartphone for the tour. Wow - what a fabulous way to bring it to life. As you entered different areas and clicked the number on the screen the app showed the room full of furniture and decor. As you turned round the app also showed the room from the angle you were looking. Most people seemed to grasp how it worked but I saw a few people who were just listening to the audio and not looking at the screen so I think they missed out."
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Lovely house!,It was an amazing experience. The exterior of the house was one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The inside of the house was different from what you usually see. The audio and visual guide was very explanatory. Definitely a must see!
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Amazing Building,"We visited the Casa Batllo after getting off the hop on, hop bus outside the building. We purchased the ticket at the gate and entered the building straight away and there were no queue at the time we visited. The audio guide was excellent and really helped around the building. Would definitely recommend a visit while in Barcelona."
"February 12, 2020",5.0,Book tickets in advance,It is a marvelous residential building with many interesting rooms and a beautiful rooftop. Book tickets in advance and walk on the roof to see the unique combination of colors used by Gaudi!
"February 11, 2020",5.0,Uniquely Gaudi,"Gaudi’s creative architecture is extraordinary. His use of colorful mosaics is delightful throughout the staircase, and there are unique details everywhere in the building. Worth the price of admission!"
"February 11, 2020",4.0,Exterior,"The entrance fee is just too expensive and the line to get in was horrendous. My opinion is admire the work of Gaudi on the exterior of that building, which was more enjoyable than be in an always crowded space inside."
"February 11, 2020",5.0,Great architectural experience,"One of the architectural works of Gaudi that deserves to be enjoyed in detail, step by step, room by room, floor to floor."
"February 11, 2020",4.0,Beautiful,When traveling it is a must to walk by this beautiful building. I don't believe you will be disappointed. Plus there are fun little neighborhoods to explore.
"February 9, 2020",4.0,"Casa Batllò is beautiful, but the price is ridiculous","We had an audio/visual guide and paid 25€ per person to get the tickets. Despite having the purchase the title and had an appointment, we still had to cue on the line like those without tickets.

What's the point on purchasing the ticket online then?

Despite this nonsense, the house is beautiful but the guide is disappointing. At some point I stopped playing the audio."
"February 9, 2020",4.0,Lovely and inspiring house,We booked tickets in advance online before we traveled. It was a very unexpected and unusual place! The outside is like nothing you have seen before and the tour of the inside is amazing too. A bit too expensive for what you get but a must see in my opinion. You would spend about an hour and a half here on average. I would recommend it if it was a little less expensive but I guess it is a treat to see something so different.
"February 7, 2020",4.0,Nice but maybe not worth the money,"We liked it. Impressive Gaudi architecture. But even if it is a very spectacular building, we felt it is a bit overpriced. Expensive ticket for a relatively small building"
"February 7, 2020",5.0,Gaudi Love,"An excellent sight, we spent 1.5 hour to walk all over. The staff didn't help us much but it was ok . It could be less expensive."
"February 6, 2020",2.0,"See the outside, skip the paid inside visit.","Casa Batllo is an architectural treasure, but you probably should pass on paying the exorbitant fee to visit the interior of this house. My wife and I paid the 25 euro each fee, buying tickets online in advance. This saved us 4 euro each to buy online and the price included an audio/video guide: Our take: even during the low season, the place is too crowded and 25 euro each is too expensive. Unless you’re a huge architecture or Gaudí fan (or are not worried about money at all), save your money, see the exterior of the building, and visit some of the other sights in the city instead, including the less costly and far more essential Sagrada Família.

To management: An appropriate fee for Casa Battlo would be around 10-15 euro each given pricing for other sights in the city."
"February 6, 2020",5.0,Must go!,"If you come to Barcelona, you must visit Antoni Gaudi's works of which Casa Batllo is one of them. We went during the day and there are already many tourists outside taking pictures of the unique front. I do recommend going back at night as it does look quite different and is worth another picture.
Upon entering, I recommend taking your time with the audio tour. It is quite entertaining learning the history and inspiration of Antoni Gaudi. His works are certainly unlike any other buildings you will see and it is difficult to describe it unless you visit it in person."
"February 5, 2020",5.0,Another Gaudí Gem,"I'm not arquittec but this building continues the style that we've been looking in our trip. Gaudí were a genius. Maybe, as usual, out of time with his designs, but the same happen with DaVincci, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and other, that their work was recognized after their death. All Gaudí art have the same form. Or deform. Is imppresive and beautiful. In Barcelona, you'll see art of Gaudí even when you don't want to see it."
"February 5, 2020",5.0,Worth a visit,"Well worth a visit and would certainly recommend buying tickets as it does get busy. A wonderful work of architecture and the audio guide provides insight. An impressive building, inside and out."
"February 5, 2020",5.0,An Otherworldly Experience,"Casa Batllo was my favorite of all the Gaudi sites in Barcelona. The whole building is unique and imaginatively created. The colors, the architecture, even the neighborhood are phenomenal."
"February 5, 2020",4.0,Interesting,"Audio tour was great. I found this place interesting but not necessarily worth the cost. I think the exterior is more spectacular than the interior. However, if you like Gaudi and find his work interesting, you will probably appreciate it more than I."
"February 4, 2020",5.0,Wow what a place,"Amazing place. The virtual reality tour is great. They dont pack the place so you can enjoy the space.

Take your time to view the building."
"February 4, 2020",5.0,Gaudi was an amazing architect,"We visited Cassa Batllo in January and there is no issue with getting tickets and walking right in.

The building was amazing and they did a fantastic job with the audio guide. The device also serves as a virtual reality view of what the room looked like when furnished and allowed you to 'look around' and view the different items in the room.

The building is from the genius of Gaudi who was whimsical and practical all rolled into one. All of his works were amazing to visit."
"February 4, 2020",5.0,One of Guadì's Masterpiece,"To think of this as a mere house is too reductive. This is a true masterpiece and Gaudì is just a genius. there is note one door, or window, or wall, or brick that has a straigh line to it... just mindblowing."
"February 3, 2020",1.0,Not what I expected,"While the building itself is pretty, the tour is all virtual so the furniture and pieces were not actually there but a virtual simulation shown on a small phone they provide for the tour. The English audio guide also seemed lacking and found myself bored by the explanations in many times.

Be sure to book online as they will charge you more for getting tickets in person. booking online also reduces your wait time.

Another note I had was The headset is reused from each person and didnt seem clean. With the coronavirus outbreak it would seem they would clean these with all the tourists coming through"
"February 3, 2020",4.0,Very cool but don’t get gold ticket,"I really enjoyed this Gaudi tour, and like any of his works, what you see inside is hard to describe except it’s definitely his and every design has a purpose. If you liked his other works you’ll like this. It’s that same style but different, of course.

My only gripe is the price. My wife and I decided to splurge and pay for the gold level tickets. WAY too much money for this. There were 3 levels, general, silver, and gold. I don’t recall what each one came with or the prices but I think we would have been fine with the cheapest/ general level.

The modern salon access you get with the gold is just a single room outfitted with antiques of the period. A guy there had us dress up in old timey clothes for one of those silly old fashioned photos like you can do at some amusement parks. We actually got two poses and the prints and digital codes were free. So that was something I guess but it’s more stupid/silly than cool and not worth it. We also got a tiny bottle of water each. So, yeah. Just get the general ticket and you’ll see the important stuff."
"February 3, 2020",5.0,"""A must do"" experience","We booked via the Julia bus tour-hop on/off. Really good value with the bus ticket plus 2 attractions included for 85 euros.
I wasn't really sure if I would enjoy Gaudi's work but it is absolutely amazing. Highly recommended to see such colour, imagination, quality workmanship and style. The queues, end of January, were minimal. There are a lot of stairs involved although I did see a lift. Don't think it was for visitors use though...worth asking if it means you get to experience, first hand the beauty of Casa Batllo. After visiting I could not wait to see more of this brilliant man's work.
Staff were friendly and helpful. The audio guide was very informative.There is a gift shop and toilets available for visitors. No one rushed us but allow at least an hour...linger to enjoy the light, colours and just ""flow"" of the house. Captivating."
"February 2, 2020",5.0,Architectural Fantasyland,"We were supposed to be on a tour to Girona and Figueres but terrible rain and winds caused the tour operator to cancel the trip, so instead we went to the Gaudi houses. We are very glad that we had the opportunity to go inside and fully learn about Casa Batlo. Seeing the curves in the woodwork and attention to detail and the beautiful mosaics and colorful glass was truly a wonderful experience. When in Barcelona you must explore this beautiful house for yourself. To think a family actually lived in this house at one time. The balconies and courtyard were amazing!"
"February 2, 2020",5.0,It´s simply beautiful,"Just the thought of someone being so avant garde, and having these ideas of aesthetics in the late XIX century and in the early XX century is astonishing. The man was simply a genius. The house itself is so detailed that you really need the Smart guide to appreciate the detalis. Fantastic."
"February 1, 2020",5.0,Casa Batllo a must in Barcelona,"One cannot leave Barcelona without going to Casa Batllo, truly amazing. Gaudí was a genius and the average person really gets to see and feel his work. A true work of love and art. Go during the day but also go at night. If visiting during the summer and weekend go to a night concert."
"February 1, 2020",5.0,Viva Gaudi!,"What a privilege to be able to visit this place! It's absolutely awesome! Gaudi was undoubtedly a genius and to have one of his masterpieces (now a private residence) available to visit is just remarkable.

Barcelona is full of such treasures but this one is just so completely accessible. Don't miss it!"
"February 1, 2020",5.0,Submerged in a piece of art,"I had seen the Casa Battlo from the outside multiple times, but visiting (silver ticket) was an addition beyond my expectations. When you are open to multi sensory experience and live architecture this will be well spend time and money."
"January 31, 2020",5.0,Stunning and worth the cost of an Gold ticket,"The queues went forever the day I visited so I lashed out on a Gold ticket, jumped the queue and after visiting the astonishingly beautiful building using the self tour headsets provided I had my photo taken from the top of the building, visited the fabulous Gaudi shop and then, as part of the Gold Pass, was given access to one of the private apartments with a stunning array of furniture and lighting and dress ups provided for a free photo shoot inside the apartment. Well worth the extra $$ if you can stretch."
"January 30, 2020",5.0,A beautiful piece of art,"Casa Batllo is a beautiful building created by Gaudi. The facade is stunning, the interior is even more breathtaking. I was really surprised to see all those fine detail it has in every corner of the house. It is not just a beautiful building, but a very functional and practical house to live in, even for today. It was not too crowded when we were there early in the morning. We went up to the roof top directly. It was stunning and we took lots of photo here. Many has mentioned that Casa Mila and Casa Batllo are very similar and visiting one of them is good enough To me, both are different. Visitor would get amazed by the detail of Casa Mila's architecture and structure, while Casa Batllo offers a even more refine touches to the already beautiful structure. Anyway, this is definitely another must visit place while you are in Barcelona."
"January 29, 2020",5.0,Gaudi’s masterpiece,"Absolutely loved this architectural masterpiece by Gaudi. The exterior looks stunning. Inside is even more beautiful.
We got the basic tickets. Waiting line wasn’t too bad. Moved very quickly. Be aware there is a lot walking and climbing stairs. And it was very crowded! Rooftop is truly breathtaking!"
"January 27, 2020",5.0,A sight to see,"We did not go inside, but stopped to see it from the outside. It is absolutely incredible to see in-person. It is crazy that you walk up from the Metro and are suddenly standing in front of this exquisite work!"
"January 27, 2020",4.0,Interesting,The audio tour is interesting and informative with the AR. A tad expensive but Gaudi fans should go if you have time...
"January 27, 2020",4.0,Great rainy day activity,"The house is very special and a great place to visit for anyone who is a fan of art nouveau. One thing to keep in mind is that Casa Batllo is definitely overpriced as are most Gaudi experiences. As long as you understand this, the visit will be enjoyable.

Our visit took place on a rainy Tuesday. Remember that you still have to queue even if you have paid in advance - unless you specifically pay to skip the line (yes, they will make money any possisble way here).

The audio guide is fun and uses AR to present how the rooms previously looked like. However it'll constantly push the wrong audio on unless you have it all the time in your hand. Still very informative and nice touch with the AR."
"January 27, 2020",4.0,Amazing architecture,My son and I are photographers. There were so many interesting images that presented themselves to our view. What an imagination Gaudi had!
"January 26, 2020",5.0,Amazing!! An Architectural and Historical Masterpiece!!,What an amazing historical house! The architectural designs are well before their time. I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the house with its original inhabitants. I recommend buying your tickets ahead of time on-line and purchasing the old fashioned picture at the end. The picture is taken in a room furnished with historical furnishings and provides a better sense of when the house was originally inhabited.
"January 26, 2020",5.0,Good and nice,"We paid for Gold Tickets, but actually were no different special in normal days which is not crowded.
I recommend to have picture in last floor in balcony which they offer and pay for it because it's good special for couple, friends and families."
"January 25, 2020",5.0,Experience daily life in Gaudi house,Once again Gaudi turns to nature to create the Batllò house. Beautiful organic shape abound everywhere and even the light well is a thing of beauty. The audio guide is what makes this tour special as they use virtual reality so that you can see how each room would be furnished and used. Well worth it!
"January 24, 2020",5.0,Batlo an AR application,Excellent tour which is magnified with the use of Augmented Reality cell phone app that they provide. You can see what it was like in Gaudi's time
"January 24, 2020",4.0,Amazing and interesting building,Incredible building like Gaudi himself. January is good for visit because not crowd. The building and style are very unique. Audio guide is great with depicting furniture and scenes from the times when living in the home. The ticket price is too high like every ticket in Barcelona
"January 23, 2020",2.0,Not worth the money,"€22 just to look around an empty house
There was nothing particularly interesting to look at and it was over quickly."
"January 22, 2020",5.0,Soooo worth the visit!,"Inside and outside, stunning architecture and design. Seems like there is a hidden surprise in every corner. We came early in the day. Short line and not a lot of people inside. Well worth it."
"January 21, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"100% worth seeing, do not miss this. Get your tickets in advance, skip the line and go right in! The audio tour and virtual tour are included in the basic ticket price and it is exceptional. It is interesting, easy to follow and gives a ton of info. I can’t imagine walking through the house with out it."
"January 21, 2020",3.0,Buy tickets online if possible,"The building is a true masterpiece - outstanding facade and unique interior. The two problems we had during the visit are: 1) The price for tickets is more expensive in person, which is not mentioned online on the page for ticket info. We could totally buy it online but we didn’t see a necessity, so we didn’t. Then we found out on the spot about the difference when it was too late already. In my opinion this should be written on the website when you check the price and the hours. 2) The house was extremely overcrowded. We visited on Monday around 11 AM and there were no timed tickets. Everybody was entering. Inside you couldn’t move and it was a real struggle to take photos. People were pushing. I got very irritated at some point. Couldn’t fully enjoy the architecture and design that I came for.
So my advice is to buy tickets online and maybe try lunch time, when everybody goes to eat."
"January 21, 2020",4.0,A very unusual building,"This house was just 100m from our hotel and it was a very windy rainy day so perfect for a visit. It was busy with a steady stream of people. To state the obvious the design, style, architecture and the building was very unique and way ahead of its time concerning the use of natural light and air conditioning. The audio guide was very good and it shed light on many aspects of the designer ideas, Mr. Gaudi. The ticket price is on the high side but worth it."
"January 20, 2020",4.0,Unique facade,"This is a very pretty and interesting building - we haven't toured inside, but the outside is lovely."
"January 20, 2020",4.0,Amazing exposure to Gaudi's art as well as his engineering in his architecture,We paid for our admission and audio guide at the Barcelona tourist info and were happy to get a 5:30 admission which allowed us to see the incredible rooftop in daylight as well as at night. There were beautiful views of Barcelona from up there in all directions. Inside we were mesmerized by how Gaudi married beauty and function in designing this amazing house. The audio guide was informative and we found that the Casa Batllo wasn't nearly as crowded as some of his other properties but allowed us to appreciate his work at our own pace. It was definitely much more pallatable to the crowds and noise at the other more popular properties.
"January 20, 2020",5.0,Rare and amazing!,"It was super interesting! The shapes, colors, all captivating! I would reccomend it to everyone! It was a nice experience."
"January 20, 2020",3.0,Lovely building but too expensive.,"My one main problem with the attractions of this type in Barcelona are the high costs to go inside. My best advice is just look at it from the outside, you don't need to pay the money to go inside."
"January 19, 2020",5.0,Excellent,This is a must see in Barcelona. Loved it! I actually enjoyed more than Casa Melia. The snow falling was a nice touch.
"January 19, 2020",4.0,Great building,"Great building to look at. Have been in in the past but not on this trip, the entry price is ok for what’s included.
It wasn’t busy when we visited so would have been a great time to go in"
"January 18, 2020",4.0,Great place to visit,"Perhaps one of the less viewed Gaudi buildings, but well worth braving the crowds to get a close-up look at his genius for planning details on top of details. For instance, the color of the tiles in the central atrium changes from top to bottom to help evenly distribute the light (see my photo)."
"January 17, 2020",5.0,Great!,Beautiful house! It was so special to see it in person! 10/10 would recommend! The auditory guide was very informative!
"January 15, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money,Empty house which you walk around in which they give you a phone you can stand in each room and look at the phone to see what it was like. The phone they give you doesnt work that well it's often showing you the room back to front. Good information given. Lots of little kids around sitting on the floor bored. Very busy they let too many people in at the same time making it more time consuming to get around the house. Brought a copy one of the photos that was taken and was given a receipt told to go online so we could download our photo but once I went online they had obviously given the wrong receipt as I have someone elses photo. Very disappointed wanted to give a copy to family. Tried to contact via email and on Instagram no reply. Reading the reviews alot of people have the same opinion I wish I had maybe looked more into the reviews rather than looking at the high score this place has!
"January 14, 2020",2.0,Empty house! Doesn't worth the price!,"25 euros to enter an EMPTY house with no furnitures... looks like a scam actually... inside the architecture is really not amazing, nothing compared to the facade.... but the facade can be seen from outside for free so don't pay, it doesn't worth it at all."
"January 13, 2020",5.0,Saturday Morning Bliss - Amazing,"This was the highlight of my trip.

I went to the Casa Batllo not knowing how to pronounce the name of it and a little in awe. I walked away knowing how to pronounce the name and still in awe.

The early line access was great - recommend this. First through the doors on a Saturday morning and having the entire place to yourself is well worth it. No others to get in your way of pictures and taking in each entire rooms is very peaceful.

The audio guide is great to give you all the history of each room and looking at the screen shows how the room looked like with furniture in it - some rooms had the furniture removed.

The first-floor living room with its wide glass windows is impressive. No straight lines here and it does remind you of an undersea adventure.

Each floor and room is magical and you have to admire the talent of Gaudi. Ahead of his times.

Even the door handles impressed me. Purpose guilt out of his own hand.

The lightwells flood the entire building and highlight the interior design work and tiling. There was thought and personal touch in every part of the place."
"January 13, 2020",4.0,Beautiful building,"What a beautiful building placed in the middle of busy shops.

It is a must when in barcalona, just to see its beauty"
"January 12, 2020",5.0,Beautiful!,A must do while in Barcelona. Some of the most beautiful architecture in the city! The only downside was the slightly high prices.
"January 12, 2020",5.0,Very beautiful house,A very beautiful house and very interesting balconies in the shape of human scules . We didn't went inside because of the very expensive ticket
"January 12, 2020",5.0,Inspiring beyond words,"We were not prepared for the awesomeness of this masterpiece.
We want to go back in 6 years when it is finished.
No hassle ticketing and entrance."
"January 11, 2020",5.0,"details, details, details","There was room to move around in this house. The tour guide noted that during high-season everyone is falling over each other. This day it was snowing inside. The top of the ""casa"" offers a panoramic view of the city."
"January 10, 2020",5.0,Night visit,"We went on the night visit and it was truly amazing, extremely worth it. We drank a glass of wine while walking in the museum wearing flashlights on our heads and headphones everything was really interesting and the view from the rooftop was also really nice."
"January 10, 2020",4.0,Gaudì to the max!,"Went here after visiting the Pederas, another Gaudì house. Wonderful and the audioguide was terrific, really brought the place alive. Don't waste your money on the extra Salas Moderne, not worth it, just another opportunity to take your photo, this time in period clothes. If that's your thing, go for it. Otherwise, just enjoy this absolutely amazing house."
"January 9, 2020",5.0,You have to visit Casa Batllo!!,"Casa Batllo was probably my favorite part of visiting Barcelona. We booked directly through the Casa Batllo website and opted for the “Gold” self guided tour for €35/each.

When we arrived just before 10am there was already a bit of a queue going, but with the gold tour you completely skip the line and go right in. I recommend scheduling as early as possible because the house does get really crowded.

The gold tour allowed us to enter a room that wasn’t available to any of the other tours - make sure you get your photo taken on the settee! They also gave us a free bottle of water when we exited the room.

The audio guide was great and I really liked the augmented reality part. I’m normally a huge fan of private guides, but we thought the audio guide they provided was perfect and I don’t think the tour is really long enough to warrant getting a guide.

Even the gift shop was awesome. I never (ever!!!) buy souvenirs but I bought a few pieces of fun Gaudi inspired jewelry and even an illustrated print of Casa Batllo.

I absolutely love Gaudi and to me, Casa Batllo is his most whimsical and fun work. It really is magical - make sure you don’t skip it when you visit Barcelona!"
"January 9, 2020",4.0,Impressive townhouse built by Goudi,"This is a good looking townhouse - originallly constructed in the late 19th century by the genius architect Antoni Goudi. It is very beautifully decorated with lights from outside. The inside of the building is full of asymetrical floors, stairs and balconies."
"January 9, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"One of the most significant houses concerning the architecture of Gaudi, Casa Batllo is located next to Casa Amatller. It is a fascinating building that you need to visit in case you visit Barcelona."
"January 9, 2020",5.0,Go for the GOLD tickets,Buy the gold passes directly from their website. You truly are front of the line. The audio tour is terrific too.
"January 9, 2020",5.0,Interior must be seen - remarkable,"On my last trip to Barcelona, I saw the exterior of Batllo, checked it off my list, and moved on.

I missed out!

This time, I took the tour. It's amazing! *Everything* is designed - the walls, the doors, the furniture, the windows. I have to say again - amazing. There is even snowfall.

Take the tour. Make sure you get all the way to the attic so you can see the vaults... an innovation Gaudi perfected and brought to Sagrada Familia."
"January 9, 2020",4.0,Good,Worth visiting if you have the time. The 3d guide is very useful and helps you imagine how life in the early 20th century in Barcelona would have been like.
"January 8, 2020",5.0,Gaudi,Visited the Casa Batlló which was so beautiful and loved the architecture and lighting in the house. It is a beautiful building and loved the details with stained glass and wood throughout the property.
"January 8, 2020",5.0,a good introduction to Gaudi architecture,"beautiful site with audio guide that is somewhat helpful
enjoy! very crowded but seems to move through fairly efficiently"
"January 8, 2020",4.0,"Interesting , lovely place.",Visit to know more about Gaudi style. Visit with Audio tour and try early morning with less crowd ..
"January 7, 2020",4.0,Another Beautiful Work from Gaudi,This building is now a museum with a curving roof created by architect Antoni Gaudi. It is along the same street of many well known shops.
"January 7, 2020",4.0,For Gaudi Fan,Loved it. You cannot miss it even when you do some shopping.Incredible architecture everyone have to see.
"January 7, 2020",4.0,Great place to visit,"Perhaps one of the less viewed Gaudi buildings, but well worth braving the crowds to get a close-up look at his genius for planning details on top of details. For instance, the color of the tiles in the central atrium changes from top to bottom to help evenly distribute the light (see my photo)."
"January 7, 2020",5.0,Inspirational building,"This was a very well curated attraction. the house itself id without doubt an absolute gem and well worth a visit even if you are on a tight schedule. But the presentation of the house on the audio guide merits special praise. This is interesting, well timed and provides a wealth of additional background that helps to enrich the visit."
"January 7, 2020",4.0,another unique architecture,"Another Gaudi masterpiece. Its beautiful and different. We spent around 30 minutes. If accompanied with kids, it could get a bit boring. The neighborhood is lovely though."
"January 6, 2020",5.0,Great experience!!,Great experience. Completely worth the time and money. So glad we didn’t miss this or Casa Mila as part of our trip to Barcelona. Highly recommend! Purchasing tickets in advance was very helpful and saved us time and effort!
"January 6, 2020",5.0,Holiday,Great place really worth the visit. It's so interesting to see all the work and imagination that's been out in.
"January 6, 2020",5.0,Must see place,Architectural masterpiece. Stays open till late and you can spend as much time as you wish. In my opinion is a very interesting and magical place that feeds your imagination.
"January 6, 2020",5.0,CASA BATILO,"We went to the Casa Batilo with Context Walking Tours. The building itself is remarkable in detail, spaces, inventive solutions, and our guide was an expert in art history and architecture. It's a don't miss adventure into the vision of an incredible architectural mind."
"January 6, 2020",4.0,Must see in Barcelona,This building or I would say House is worth going to. Smart guide is alsi good and show some Real life experience of old times. Overall house is well shown and show real Gaudi's work. Completely attracted towards nature.
"January 6, 2020",5.0,Definitely worth the money,"You have to arrive early (8:30am) but the benefit is an uncrowded, unrushed visit to this amazing venue. We were 3rd and 4th in line and in most rooms had the rooms entirely to ourselves - to take picture, to look at the detail, and take in what the audio guide was saying.

The guide is very good but I definitely recommend bringing your own headphones."
"January 5, 2020",5.0,Amazing architecture,There are currently 2 different visits on offer. One is the torchlight visit and the other is the daytime visit. There are different levels of daytime visits available offering priority access and access to an additional area. The restoration is being funded by paid tourist visits and the audio guide provides some fascinating information about the project. It also superimposes furniture into the rooms to show how they may have looked in the past. What a fascinating structure!
"January 5, 2020",5.0,Wow! This place is really magical,"You can really see the genius of architect Antonio Gaudí in this house. All the details he thought of. All the different designs and even engineering aspects of the house. All in his head! Outstanding! If you appreciate architecture and art, and like modernism, you should definitely go to this place. Also, if you want a nice souvenir and skip the line, I recommend the gold option."
"January 5, 2020",5.0,Skipping the line really works,"I skipped the line, and was amongst the first viewers of the day. It is, of course the most wonderful building, and in many rooms I was one of just a few visitors. I have even taken a photograph of the front living area with its magnificent Windows without anyone else present. By the time I was reluctantly leaving, the crowds were in most rooms and there was a long queue of people waiting to get inside. Skipping the line and go first thing in the morning. HIghly recommended."
"January 5, 2020",5.0,A must see place,We bought the Gold ticket online to skip the queue due to our very limited time in Barcelona and it was worth it. You really skip the long queue! The whole tour was mesmerising! The audio worked very well and the sound was perfect. Loved the virtual experience on the audio device. Taking a vintage photo was a nice experience. We were only few people there and had lots of time to choose our dress and didn't feel we were rushed. A must see place in Barcelona.
"January 4, 2020",5.0,Not a square in the entire structure,"Curved walls, fantastic colors, unusual furniture, tile, and history. Antonio Gaudi's vision and talent are showcased in this home."
"January 4, 2020",4.0,Great looking Gaudi building,Looks stunning and took some great pics outside. Didn’t bother with buying tickets to go in as it’s rather overpriced for what you actually see inside. However great photo opportunity outside with the facade the real star here.
"January 4, 2020",3.0,The outside is amazingly unique,I saw this building as part of a Gaudi walking tour. I did not go inside as all Gaudi buildings are expensive to enter and thusly are not tourist friendly. It seems like it's an effort to make as much money as possible off the tourist.
"January 4, 2020",4.0,Casa Batllo,"I was surprised to see the apartment building bang on the heart of Barcelona's commercial street. And was also surprised to understand that an apartment can also be designed like this.
Visit from the street was contentful."
"January 4, 2020",5.0,Antonio Gaudi,"One of Barcelona's landmarks. Magical. Mesmerizing. Watch walk away, return and rediscover the details you have missed earlier. Repeat endlessly or until your flight is up!"
"January 4, 2020",5.0,So beautiful,"Barcelona has many lovely houses built by the famous architect Gaudi and this one may be the most beautiful of all. The blue facade and the dancing balconies are simply lovely. It is possible to visit all the houses that Gaudi designed but we chose only one, Casa Milà, or La Pedrera and saw this one from the outside. The house next to it is also famous and beautiful. Shouldn’t be missed."
"January 4, 2020",4.0,Was not worth it.,"I believe this place was over hyped. Until and unless you are art or architecture fanatic, this is not truly worth visiting if you have other things to do."
"January 3, 2020",5.0,If you in Barca - you need to see it,"Is is a face and a soul of the city - Gaudi’s creation! Smart guide, nice trip route and great beauty of this place would give you great experience and great impression about Gaudi and Barcelona )"
"January 3, 2020",4.0,Fantastic architecture from outside and even better at night time,The architecture is just amazing from outside and even better at night time with all the lights etc. But I couldnt convince myself to spend €90 for a family of 4. It is shockingly expensive even more than Sagrada which is the No.1 attraction in Barcelona.
"January 2, 2020",3.0,Disappointed,"The building is certainly an architectural Gaudi masterpiece. It’s very sad to see that it’s used in a very business oriented manner. The smart guide was very disappointing. Very overrated. I expected much more, much better technology, much more content, especially given the price that was payed for it."
"January 2, 2020",5.0,Snow in the inner courtyard and great audio tour,"The audio tour is well worth the time and money and took about an hour. You get to see the first floor, the back courtyard, the roof, and more. The highlights are the front room and the roof. So much color and form and function all rolled together. Be sure to get your photo on the top balcony - one of the best tour photos I’ve ever had taken. I wish they had something showing the “before” that Guadí had to work with. The transformation is pretty incredible. There is a model of it at La Pedrera, which I’ve included in the attached photos. Oh yeah, there is artificial snow falling down through the covered center courtyard, which was pretty interesting."
"January 1, 2020",5.0,The Wonder of Barcelona !,"Splendid house ! If you must visit one of Gaudi’s work of art, this is the one you shouldn’t miss. Each and every corner of this house is a surprise for the visitor. Original and unique ! The audio guide is included and really useful. The only downsides : a lot of visitors and too expensive : 81 euros for 2 adults and a junior) !!!!"
"December 31, 2019",5.0,Another beautiful Gaudi design,"Because of the uncertain political conditions in Barcelona around the time of our visit, we hadn’t purchased tickets to the two Gaudi-designed houses on Passeig de Gracia, and we had already seen long lines forming at Casa Batllo (remodeled by Gaudi 1904-1906) during our walks to the Metro station. We checked online and knew that tickets were available, so we purchased them just before we went there (22 Euros per person senior admission). An interesting audiovisual tour was included in the ticket price and included a device that showed how each room would have looked when it was furnished and decorated. There were a lot of stairs to climb as we ascended to the various floors but we were rewarded with interesting sights, including the fanciful structures on the roof. If you are a lover of blue in your decor, you will love this place! I do think it is overpriced, especially when compared with other Gaudi attractions such as the more interesting Casa Mila (La Pedrera), Parc Guell, and Sagrada Familia. Try to visit early or late as the lines can get long even with a ticket."
"December 30, 2019",5.0,Worth going inside,Worth going inside for a tour with their very well done audio guide. As someone who enjoys architecture this building was a fun experience and an impressive demonstration.
"December 30, 2019",3.0,Overpriced,"I wouldn't deny Casa Batllo is a beautiful architecture, but it's certainly overpriced in two aspects: 1. compared with other sightseeings in Barcelona (can you believe tickets for Casa Batllo cost as much as La Sagrada Familia?) 2. compared with the living cost in Barcelona. It's very crowded inside and I seriously think the experience would be much better if they further restrict the amount of visitors in each session. Whoever runs Casa Batllo, in my opinion, only cares about money.

My suggestion: if you have adequate budget and time, it probably still worths a visit, but if you are planning an inexpensive trip, I would recommend visiting 1 or 2 sites designed by Domonique besides Sagrade Familia, such as Santa Creu and Sant Pau hospital or Catalonia music hall. Gaudi is AMAZING, but Barcelona doesn't only have Gaudi."
"December 30, 2019",5.0,Ergonomically Designed,"Gaudi is a real genius architect who knew how to design buildings ergonomically and thought of sustainability way back in his time, while people in 21st century still need to gain a more awareness of sustainability. Despite all the crowds, you will eventually get to enjoy every tiny piece Gaudi designed.

P.S I would recommend buying a gold ticket to avoid a long line at the entrance."
"December 30, 2019",5.0,Amazing,They do a great job with the interactive features. You get to go on your own through the house. We did the early morning which is the best because no one is there. Buy tickets on line.
"December 30, 2019",4.0,Outside was enough,"Sadly we did not have enough time to go on the tour, and quite frankly I think it a bit overpriced, we did visit the outside of this Gaudi gem and just looking up at this awesome building was enough for us.

We were lucky to arrive in the early AM in low season so there no crowds and easy to find up-close views from all angles. And some mighty fine pix ops.

Don't miss this gem. Even if you can;t afford the time or money to go inside."
"December 30, 2019",5.0,Excellent!,"I was really amazed! If you love art, Casa Batlló is perfect. I was there in April 2019. I haven't bought the ticket before, the line was long, but it took only 30 minutes to buy the ticket."
"December 30, 2019",2.0,Long lines,"We purchased 4 tix and I assumed, wrongly, that they would allow us to bypass the long lines. We still, even with tickets in hand, had to wait in a line that stretched around the block. It doesn't make sense to buy the tickets ahead of time as the ticket buying line had no line! The exhibit was spectacular and audio guide was informative but their organization of ticket selling/lines is terrible."
"December 29, 2019",5.0,Interesting architect design,Colorful and lively designs all over the site. Amazed by the detailed artwork everywhere even the door knob.
"December 29, 2019",4.0,Nice,Very Nice... one of best ghaudi's works of art. You should visit while In Barcelona and make sure to book skip the line ticket
"December 29, 2019",4.0,Unique,Cannot visit Barcelona without seeing Gaudi creations. Book in advance your tickets. Choose early morning hours as it gets quite busy later on.
"December 29, 2019",5.0,Can’t miss this!,"This home was the most beautiful I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been to the Vanderbilt mansions in Rhode Island. The venue provided the equivalent of iPhones that you could use to see how it once was when it was in use. Highly recommend!"
"December 29, 2019",5.0,Can’t miss,"With Sagrada Familia and La Perdera, the 3 can’t miss Gaudí structures. The tour inside is a little strange with some unnecessary use of VR. But the guide does share some very useful context for the house’s design, and the structure itself is amazing."
"December 28, 2019",3.0,Disappointing.,Architecture is good but perhaps not as amazing as portrayed. It’s a good tour to understand Catalan style of architecture. I don’t think there is much to see beyond 1 hr. The audio guide doesn’t work well. Overpriced! Best part was gold member access to the living rooms etc where one can take some good pics.
"December 27, 2019",4.0,Amazing house to many silly people.,"Amazing looking house. But too many people at once they need to control the numbers as not a nice experience. We turned up without a ticket and then bought a gold ticket which meant we walked straight in . The que was very long even for those with tickets so this was worth it, However once inside it was over crowded. The main problem was people trying to take photos of everything which was just stupid. Many people standing in the very narrow hallways holding everyone up. I got sick of it after a while and ended up barging through. Honestly people it is just a door knob."
"December 27, 2019",4.0,A work that delights the imagination.,Gaudi’s genius is on display here and it is a quick introduction the the magic you will experiene throughout Barcelona.
"December 27, 2019",1.0,"Gaudi Would Hate It - Beautiful Building, Terrible Experience","The building was amazing, the experience was terrible. This review has nothing negative to say about the building itself - the architecture is amazing, and Gaudi truly was a genius. My experience of the building, however, was ruined by the way visitors were managed within the building and the smartguide. I know the building is popular, and for good reason, but when I went (on a winter morning) the building was heaving with visitors and made moving through the space very difficult and actually quite distressing (can't begin to think how it is in summer). I am usually fine with crowds but I found this to be a very anxious experience due to the volume of people in the building. Numbers should be limited for the safety of people and the historic architecture. The audio and visual guide I found to be very strange and quite unnecessary, and actually resulted in a lot of people viewing the building solely through the screen of the phone which defeats the purpose of visiting a place. The screen literally showed you the same view of the room but with furniture in - what was the point? They could have just displayed old photographs. The building is still breathtakingly beautiful without needing to be shown that there was once furniture in it! The audio was pretty useless too and gave you very little historical information (which I would have liked) and instead just told you where to look and when in each room, meaning that everybody ended up looking in the same places and made thoroughfare very congested and the rooms crowded. I understand the motivation behind having a 'smart guide' that allows people to interact with the building but for me having both audio and smartphone combined to make it useless. After Casa Batllo I went to La Pedrera and their audioguide was simple and much more effective, as well as still being 'smart'. Overall, I was extremely disappointed and quite freaked out at the experience of Casa Batllo, and it prevented me from enjoying a building that is rightfully a UNESCO World Heritage site. I can't help but think that if Gaudi could see Casa Batllo now he would be disappointed at how it has become digitised, and monetised, and aims only to make profit off as much footfall as possible. It was like being in a Black Mirror episode.
I have never written a negative review before and I don't like them, but I felt so strongly about my experience in Casa Batllo that i just had to say something. I am glad that so many people have a lovely experience enough to write a positive review, but next time I know that I will just admire the beauty from the outside."
"December 27, 2019",4.0,Pretty amazing house with beautiful details all over,"There are lots of great details, and lots of beauty. The guide is quite good, although the AR aspect is merely okay. We were lucky that it wasn't too full -- I fear trooping up the stairs with full crowds wouldn't be too fun. The views from the roof, the mosaics overall, the beautiful play with light and use of natural shapes and curves were some of my highlights.

The one star removal is for the high price -- it is worth seeing, I think, and a great example of Gaudi ""in the small"" (e.g. vs Sagrada Familia), but quite costly for the two floors of the house and stairwell, and those were often rather empty."
"December 26, 2019",3.0,"Good, not great","The building and architecture are interesting, but the virtual guide is no substitute for having real decor and furnishings. The augmented reality was not enough to offset the empty rooms and holes in the walls. Some of the audio commentary was very informative, some of it clearly guesswork."
"December 26, 2019",5.0,Gaudi in full flight,This house was so interesting. Everywhere you looked was colourful and had interesting shapes. Even the internal stairwell treatment was interesting. Well worth the visit.
"December 26, 2019",4.0,Construction kinda ruined the 5 star.,"They were, unfortunately, doing construction on the exterior when I visited, so that took away from the experience. However that aside the architecture here is just beautiful. If you have the money to spend, check it out! Some people kinda argued that it was cool, but not worth the price, which could be fair, but if youre only visiting once. ::shrug ::"
"December 25, 2019",5.0,Beautiful house!!!,"It is a beautiful architecture building but not friendly for children under 6. If you have a kid consider not visiting this place. There is no elevator, so no strollers, there is a lot of time to spend per room to really appreciate the architecture.
The site is incredible."
"December 25, 2019",5.0,Fabulous tour of an amazing house,"One of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona was this 2 hour self guided audio tour of this amazing Gaudi classic , Book ahead as like most of the premier sights this was very busy but we could walk past the large queue and up to the desk with no bother. The house itself is a delight and with the augmented 3D tour you can see how Gaudi wanted the building to look like , on every level is another delight but the best is on the roof where the dragon is laid out in the sunshine ,Very recommended"
"December 24, 2019",5.0,A Must See for Appreciating Gaudi's Genius,"Family from grandparents to 5 year old all found Gaudi's Casa Batllo to be marvelous. The architecture, the rooms and center air circulating shaft, the woodwork and glass, from the garden terrace to the roof were all amazing sights and inspired living spaces. It is truly a gift to the eyes, and a lift to the spirit to share this lovely space. You cannot truly get a feel for the full experience of Gaudi without spending time at Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, and the Sagrada Familia -- you can see where he tested ideas and pulled in the interplay of nature and culture to create wondeful buildings for living and sharing."
"December 24, 2019",5.0,"Extraordinary house, so worth a visi","It’s quite impossible to do justice to Casa Battlo in a review - just go, marvel at Gaudi’s genius, then go and see some of his other masterpieces. The tour is really well-organised and the audio-guides are excellent. Just remember to book tickets online - you automatically save 4€ per person that way. Stunning and quite unique."
"December 24, 2019",5.0,Wow. Just wow.,"I went in the off season, and early in the day so I had only a few people in the rooms with me at a time to take some great photos. It really has to be seen to be believed. Like a giant curving, undulating, underwater themed home, with a cool elevator, a center small interior space that is blue and gorgeous, and an attic that looks like something out of a space ship or Superman 1. If you build things you MUST come here, the attention to detail is paramount and sometimes impossible to believe. OF course you have to like Gaudi's work. Great gift shop too, a little better than the other Gaudi ones, in my opinion."
"December 23, 2019",5.0,Great experience,"Must see place in Barcelona! Bought the tickets on TripAdvisor as they were cheaper then at the ticket office at Casa Batlló
Really enjoyed the experience! The kids loved it too!"
"December 23, 2019",4.0,Birthday treat,We visited site on my birthday. Truly enjoyed the experience. Architecture inspired!. Very popular destination so lots of people to navigate but still worth a visit
"December 21, 2019",5.0,The Frank Lloyd Wright of Spain,"Very interesting architecture. Not something I would want to live in, but very interesting to tour. The ocean theme is prevalent, and the view from the roof is awesome."
"December 20, 2019",4.0,Gothic architecture,We visited this unique building with the special windows structure. It couldn't be fou elsewhere except Barcelona. It's worth paying a visit.
"December 20, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"Absolutely loved walking through this house! Stunning and you can’t help but touch the walls and the wood. The snow feature in the middle of the house was so peaceful to watch, I could have stood there all day. The audio guide was also really interesting :D"
"December 20, 2019",5.0,Visit to Casa Batlo,"One more stunning creation by Gaudi, should not be missed at all. Advance online ticket purchase shall help in saving time and better time planning. Best time to visit is during the sundown."
"December 20, 2019",5.0,Good,Very interesting to see how Gaudi lived and see things from his lens. 14 different stages. All put together nicely.
"December 19, 2019",5.0,Casa Batlló Blue,Incredible experience the architecture was amazing and walking through the home and being able to see the furniture on the smartphone provided with information on how he lived and what he did in different rooms was amazing I’m glad we got the chance to visit this and see the amazing work of Gaudi !
"December 19, 2019",4.0,"Nice, unique, interesting.","It's one of Barcelona's most popular places. It's different from all you know, so it's worth a visit. I don't know what's inside, and if it worth the money to go in, but from outside - it's very impressive."
"December 19, 2019",5.0,Miss,"Really enjoyed over all experience, very well kept property, thanks to an owners who cares about art and making sure coming generations will be able to see it, with innovative and easy to use audio guide. You are experiencing it in your own phase with option to come back and review your favorite spots. Definitely worth to visit!"
"December 18, 2019",5.0,"Maybe a Madman, but Cerainly a Genius","I have never seen anything else comparable to this! It isn't only that Gaudi envisioned this, but that he was able to have it built according to his vision. The Smart Guide is also amazing--not only a narrative, but video overlays of what the home looked like when it was occupied."
"December 18, 2019",5.0,House of bones,"What a fantastic place, extremely interesting and informative, audio guide was excellent and interactive ans as for the building itself, it was the eye opener I expected fantastic value for money and one of the best places to visit in barcelona"
"December 17, 2019",5.0,Must-see Gaudi house,"Wild, Seussian-like house designed by Gaudi in the heart of Barcelona. The craftsmanship and ingenuity is beautiful and inspiring. I recommend doing the 'early' admission (8:30) if you want some good pics without crowds. I would have liked to go back for the night moonlight visit as well, but weather and timing didn't allow."
"December 17, 2019",5.0,interesting,This was amazing to see what a very clever man to design this house. The detail for everything is pure brilliance well worth a visit.
"December 16, 2019",5.0,I want to live there!,"You have to book well in advance because going there directly without ticket can be a real nightmare.
it is a magical place that you have to visit in Barcelona. Gaudi was a genius!"
"December 16, 2019",5.0,Glad we fit it in,We went in first group in the morning (which started a little late) and still spent 2 hours walking the halls in this beautiful house. We became fans of Gaudi while on the trip.
"December 16, 2019",5.0,The most magical house!,It is like walking into a fantasy. The place is magical enough from the outside. But walking into it is a different matter. Started from the main entrance you are already greeted by the most stunning curves and waves. My favorite is definitely the living room. One must really come see this place for a true visit to Barcelona.
"December 15, 2019",4.0,Like something you’d see in Disneyland,Very beautiful and strange at the same time. It really looks like something you would see in Disneyland. At night it lit up with lights to add to the ambiance. Cool stopz
"December 15, 2019",5.0,Gaudí ... an architect´s genius,"This house, Casa Millá & (later on) la Sagrada Familia are the best examples of the use of natural light by Gaudí ... astonishing !!!"
"December 15, 2019",5.0,So glad we took the time for this!,"It seems our time in Barcelona became all about Gaudi, with this amazing place as the highlight! The color & light, design & grace of the very unique place seems such a stark contrast to the austere & simple life of the designer. This beautiful place truly is awe inspiring. Be sure to buy your tickets ahead! We did the Gold ticket so we could see everything & it included a vintage photo...a bit of a disappointment as it was nothing special...would have preferred that the photo on the little outdoor balcony have been included."
"December 14, 2019",5.0,Beautiful!,Definitely worth a visit! Gaudi was a genius! We used our Barcelona card. Traveling in December is great! There were no lines and we never had to wait for tables at restaurants.
"December 13, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,A very interesting place to visit and a visit to this town is incomplete without a tour inside. The Hop on/off bus entitles you to a discount if you have that and the gold pass though expensive is the way to see this place if you can afford it. The Gold pass lets you in on an exclusive accommodation part of the Casa and you get to wear a costume and get some photos clicked which you get a copy of...
"December 12, 2019",5.0,Is that a paradise?,This place belongs to god. It is totally a paradise!! One of the most famous architecture from Gaudi. You can’t imagine how beautiful it is unless you see it. The glass with blue sunshine in inside the building. All the glories and inspiration of this building is something that I have never seen before. I probably will be here for more than just once or twice.
"December 12, 2019",5.0,A very intriguing building. :),Very interesting building made by Gaudi. It's so different from what you usually see. I think anyone should experience it and maybe be inspired. The Virtual Guide was also really nice too :)
"December 12, 2019",5.0,Great architecture,Another must see in Barcelona we didn't go in as we were short on time however standing outside we were able to get some great photos
"December 11, 2019",5.0,Amazing beautiful building,This place gave us an extraordinery experience. Definitely worth to visit!! Very happy to start the day with such an experience :)
"December 11, 2019",5.0,Amazing,Was a spontaneous stop on a short visit - so glad we took the time! Such imagination and creativity - unconstrained by convention.
"December 11, 2019",4.0,Good place to visit for historical value,We had a lovely time at this place. My family and I truly enjoyed the architecture and the guided tour of the facility that was provided by a local guide.
"December 11, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"This place is astonishing. Even from outside it’s unreal, but step inside and it’s like no house you have ever seen. Never having seen Gaudi’s work before, only pictures, we were surprised at how beautiful and well crafted everything is.
The audio tour is very useful. The terrace at the top of the house is beautiful, with the most fantastical chimneys. Loved it."
"December 10, 2019",5.0,Another crazy place,"Again, it's more than just looking different. The electronic guide is brilliant but it will blow your mind at how all this worked way back when. It's not cheap, but you will not forget your visit."
"December 10, 2019",5.0,Great place even at rainy day,"I liked this place from the first moment I bought the tickets. I've got an email from one of the managers with descriptions, plans, even with the list of the best restaurants around Casa Battlo. We visited this building at very rainy day but it was so romantic to look throw those incredible windows. And I'v got an thanks giving letter after visit. Great place and perfect communication."
"December 10, 2019",5.0,Wow,"I liked it a lot, although the admission ticket is not cheap, yet it deserved every penny, gaudi is something"
"December 10, 2019",5.0,Strol around,We enjoyed to strol around Passeig de Gracia and have a look at Gaudis two campus Casas Batllo and Mila. Excellent spot to make nice pictures.
"December 10, 2019",5.0,Amazing Experience,A very unique and amazing experience. Worth your time and money. Everything inside is astonishing and the audio guide helps to understand the background details.
"December 9, 2019",5.0,Magnificent Gaudi,Very interesting - informative and imaginative virtual tour around unbelievable house Gaudi's creation. Tour is worth money spent. You can take as much time as you want and explore Casa Batllo in your own pace.
"December 9, 2019",5.0,Fascinating!!!,"The Casa Batllo does not disappoint!!
Right in the heart of Barcelona, doing this walking tour gives you a great perspective of the works of Gaudi!! from the views of the home from the street, to the views from the home of the street, and everything in between, you can feel this space!! Easy to walk and cover the entire home in 30 minutes, but you can drink in the many flavors of Gaudi with this tour!! Enjoy it, you will not be disappointed!!"
"December 9, 2019",5.0,One of the most fascinating excursions,Got online tockets which helped to skip the line (in the end of November the line wasn't very huge but we saved definitely 30 minutes or more). The was audioguide included. And it's absolutely worth. You get lots of interesting information which helps to.understand this building much better. Also there are some cool 3D-features instulled in this guide. So you can sea how the room was equiped with furnuture for instance. Casa Batllo is the house with history and soul.
"December 9, 2019",5.0,Woow,"Everyone should go visit it inside!! It' s huge and leaves you breathless! Just perfection - colours, forms and a great souvenir store, at the end of the tour!!
A true Barcelona representative!!"
"December 9, 2019",4.0,Casa Batllo,Amazing and unique architectural design which is one of the must see places in Madrid. It is walking distance to Placa de Catalunya and must see La Rambla!
"December 8, 2019",5.0,great tour,"Well worth the price of admission, great views and photo opps. What a brilliant mind Gaudi had. He was truly a visionary."
"December 8, 2019",5.0,Fascinating!,"Riveting, mind-expanding, beautiful. Go at your own pace with the audio tour and be amazed by the modernist genius of Gaudi."
"December 8, 2019",4.0,A must see,An interesting house with nice design inside and outside. It takes around 2-3 hours to see the whole house. You get given headphones and a smartphone so that at certain spots of the house you get a VR experience showing what the house used to look like - it’s very clever and very unique. It’s yet another Gaudi site that must be seen
"December 8, 2019",1.0,Don't bother with the early entry ticket (or any ticket at all for that matter). Terrible experience,"Don't get me wrong- the building itself is beautiful. But it's just as amazing if you only look at the exterior of the building. We went last Wednesday with an early access ticket (8:30am entry) which is supposed to allow entry to the building 30 mins before the opening time (9am) so that you can take some good pictures without having a large crowd around you. This early access ticket is expensive and its NOT WORTH IT AT ALL (39 euro per person). First of all, they didn't actually allow you in at 8:30am. We arrived on time and the staff were still setting up while having fun chatting with each other. Second, it was raining very heavily last Wednesday. They clearly had enough space to allow people to wait inside (because not many people bought the early access tickets) but we were forced to wait outside in the pouring rain. Once they finally finished setting up, it was already like 8:40ish (you can imagine I was clearly unhappy paying that much money for an extra 20 mins only) and we were all soaking wet. I complained to the staff and they didn't even apologize (in fact, didn't even say a word back to me to explain). The girl behind me had a 9am ticket. While it was not her entry time yet, she got kicked out back in the train when they could've let her wait inside. I felt bad for her. We were near Casa Batillo on a sunny day in the afternoon 2 days after, and we saw no crowds waiting at all, so no point going early in the morning or getting early access at all in low season, if you reallly want to see the inside."
"December 8, 2019",5.0,Stunning,We visited in November and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The colour and design are simply stunning. Worthy of visiting.
"December 7, 2019",5.0,Magical architecture presented by audio and augmented reality done with piety.,"One of the most wondrous piece of architecture I've ever visited. The tour was cleverly designed and gave increment value to the experience. The day was very rainy and we couldn't go to the roof, but the water drops behind the windows and the sound of the rain at the attic increased the mystic atmosphere of the building. Really worth of visiting and taking the tour in peace."
"December 6, 2019",5.0,Gaudi Essential!,"This is the quintessential Gaudi visit, so if you are coming to learn more and see the work of Gaudi in Barcelona, you must start here! Easy to find, easy to tour, flows pretty fast, and each room has the master's touch on it. Each work of his is different, so it's not ""seen one seen them all"", Casa Batlo show cases the design, texture, lines, construction, and art of Gaudi. Enjoy your tour!!"
"December 5, 2019",5.0,Beautifull,"Amazing, of the most beautiful things I've seen in Barcelona, also with a good location near many shops for shopping"
"December 5, 2019",3.0,Beautiful Home,"This is a beautiful home and it is really unusual. I guarantee that you will not see another quite like it. The truly great part about Gaudi is everything is similar, but it is definitely a one off experience with each building. The tile work with all the curves is really awesome. The light towers on the ends are a really unusual and novel way to introduce light. That being said the cheapest ticket is 25 euros. There is absolutely no way it is worth 25 euros. The Sagrada Familia is 17 euros! The palace of Versailles is 20 euros for crying out loud and it is most definitely not Versailles. If I had to do it again I would not spend the 25 and the ticket price ruins the experience. A family of 4 would blow $100 Euros."
"December 5, 2019",4.0,Gaudi's Masterpiece,"Casa Batllo is another great specimen of Gaudi's outstanding architecture. A very unique building indeed.... you won't come across buildings like these very often. In first look, it doesn't look real rather a building from a comic / cartoon book. It's amazing that Gaudi conceived this design 100 years back. The building is around 10 minutes walk from Placa Catalunya."
"December 5, 2019",4.0,Beautiful house,"Very lovely house, the entry ticket was a bit expensive but the virtual reality tour was pretty interesting, definitely a nice touch. Really great to see Gaudi's work, I would say for sure one of Gaudi's best houses in Barcelona. Not necesarily a must visit though if you are not a fan of Gaudi or an art lover, depends however on how much time you have. House can be pretty crowded and entry queues can be quite big so I recommend you get your ticket online."
"December 5, 2019",5.0,Awesome craftsmanship and a wicked mind,"This is one of Gaudi finest moments. What an incredibly beautiful place. The craftsmanship is beyond what words can say.

The audio tour is definitely worth the money. The upkeep and renovations are solely funded by ticket sales. The audio tour was incredible as your device also shows illustrations and images of how the home used look when people were living in it.

It was a wet and rainy day but don’t miss going out side as the roof and court yard is amazing."
"December 4, 2019",4.0,See both day & night,Its a must see building but I didnt go inside because you can do something else for that 25 euros. However you should visit both day and night so you can see it in daylight and with lights on
"December 3, 2019",5.0,Incredible!!,It worth the visit and the money. Through the audio guide actually you can see how the house was before as it has got camera which is incredible. It is a bit expensive but generally Barcelona's sightseeings are expensive.
"December 3, 2019",5.0,One of my favorite Guell buildings,You can tell so much thought and love went into this work of art. So much color and detail in the design. The audio tour really added to the experience and gave some depth to the story. I only wish I would have had time to take the night tour
"December 2, 2019",5.0,A shining example of beaux-arts architecture,"We loved Casa Batllo. The only issue with it is the crowds, so if you can plan your visit for the quietest time available during your trip, do it. The curving lines, creativity everywhere, unique design and decor are emblematic of an era. It's like walking into a Mucha poster, and well worth the price of entry."
"December 2, 2019",2.0,Disappointing at Night,"For the amount of money this cost, I really don't recommend going. I didn't study art or architecture... but I also really loved everything else Gaudi-focused in the city. But this fell flat for me and I regretted the money I spent 5 mins after entering. It may have been more enjoyable had it been light - I went in the evening. So I'd try for that. Sorry to those of you that LOVED this. I just didn't. I wish someone had told me to skip it and just take photos from the outside."
"December 2, 2019",5.0,Excellent insight into why Gaudi was such a big influence on Barcelona,"This was a nice, concise audio tour of the Casa Batllo. The audio descriptions included just enough detail for my tastes, without droning on too long. We went early in the morning (10:30 am) before the crowds got too big, which was a plus. We passed by the site later in the day, and the crowds on the sidewalk had grown exponentially from when we were there. On the basic tour, be prepared for a little stair climbing, since the tour progresses from the first floor to the roof, all by stairs. You don't have access to all of the old apartments on each floor (as some appear to be occupied by businesses), but you see the entire floor where the original owner lived, and it is representative of all the major features. Don't skip the attic and the roof, as the view is awesome, and the attention to small architectural details was incredible."
"December 2, 2019",5.0,Great Gaudi experience,Great visit. The best of all of the Gaudi houses to visit. Early Access was the best. Less crowds and more chances to take pictures. The audio and visual tour was great and informative.
"December 1, 2019",5.0,Such a cool building!,"This was a really good tour, with a cool virtual reality hand-held device. The building is fairly large, and you get to see a lot of levels, plus the attic and roof. Plan for 1.5 hours, or more if it's crowded. We did the basic blue tour, which was fine in my opinion. It was not overly crowded in November, which was nice."
"December 1, 2019",3.0,An overpriced masterpiece,"Casa Battlo is undoubtfully one of Gaudi's most interesting and beatiful works of art. With this said, the 25 euro paid for the entry still feel like a rip off when comparing to other museums entry fees, especially since the exterior is way more impressive and the house itself is empty. What feels even more disppointing is to see that the price is being justified by the management through the smartguide. Honestly, the smartguide was a nice addition, but would've gladly done with a normal audio guide if that would've cut the price in two. The experience overall is nice, although it felt kind of crowded even for a scheduled visit on a Thursday evening, the house is well worth seeing, but for that price, it can't go to 5* on my list."
"December 1, 2019",5.0,Spectacular house,...architecturally speaking a real gem and the colors and the balconies and and and. Go early as it will be too crowded otherwise.
"December 1, 2019",4.0,Marvellous.,"Another place typical of Gaudi's work with a wonderful interior, The 3D tour was very interesting but again, even with a designated entry time the place was very full, although not so much that it reduced the enjoyment although this was January; possibly in high season it would be intolerable.
Well worth a visit, you won't be disappointed."
"November 30, 2019",5.0,"Spectacular, and colours really cool at night","This was the first Gaudi attraction my wife and I visited in Barcelona and it started the trip off well for us! The colours and shapes were all great, and we really enjoyed it. It was especially interesting at night with the way they had everything lit. Highly recommend it!"
"November 30, 2019",4.0,Gaudi is a genius,Very nice Informative expensive though but when you visit you appreciate Gaudi’s genius I don’t believe there is a better expression of nature in a man made structure You should see it
"November 30, 2019",5.0,The best Gaudi house in Barcelona,"Definitely the best of the Gaudi houses strewn across Barcelona. The house evokes the feeling of being in an aquarium or under water as you go through the floors of the house.

The best views are during the evening so you can time it such that you enter around 5PM and leave around 7PM to get the best pictures of the house.

Also having an audio guide is a lot of help and eases the plan of walking around the house and also focuses you on key aspects - not to mention the audio guides have a neat augmented reality function to play with.

From the floor to the rooftop, this was the most memorable visit of the Gaudi houses and one that must be seen if you had to choose one during a visit to Barcelona."
"November 29, 2019",5.0,Incredible,We'd loved this house architecture was incredible so different. Features you see no where else Gaudi had such unique ideas
"November 29, 2019",5.0,Mesmerizing,We visited in November with our teens and we were all captivated by the artistry. The audio tour was informative and fun. Highly recommend.
"November 29, 2019",5.0,Awesome architectural art,Enjoy the world's most famous architectural master - Guadi. A master of uniquely blending architecture and art. Guadi had a very imaginative and creative mind.
"November 28, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"My second visit to this amazing building, last time was about 20 years ago. We got there mid afternoon and luckily there weren’t too many people there so we could take our time and listen to the audio player as we entered each room. It’s simply a breathtaking piece of architecture, everything from the doors to windows have all been handcrafted and thought through. Anybody with an interest in design should visit and appreciate the thought that had gone into every detail."
"November 28, 2019",5.0,This is the best architectural place to visit if you look for Gaudi's works.,"This is the must see piece if you look for Gaudi's works which includes Casa Mila and Sagrada Família. It represent more elegant architectural style of his talent than other works. You shall be amazed by its unique and splendid shapes of his architecture.

For your tips, please never fail in getting Casa Batllo Gold ticket, in order to avoid long line of ques for entrance."
"November 27, 2019",5.0,Super seconds after the Milà.,"Q-Trip: My suggestion is Milà at 9 and Batlló next with
lunch at Billy Brunch. What a morning!
Or just go for the breakfast and Capp.
Q-Trip: Take extra time for Milà as the attic information
display are fantastic. They demand time.
Milà can be done in less than an hour."
"November 26, 2019",5.0,Do Not Miss!,"Magnificent display of Gaudi at his best, in every sense of the word. His architectural brilliance, form and detail, is simply without compare. There are so many facets to his creation, it takes your breath away. The evening light make the entire cathedral look mystical. Truly the finest work of art!"
"November 26, 2019",5.0,Fascinating,My son and I had a great time at the Casa Batllo. We loved the architecture and the self-paced tour with the audio. I'd recommend going during the day so you can see everything lit with natural sunlight!
"November 25, 2019",5.0,Our favorite Gaudi tour!,"Did the early morning tour of Gaudi’s creation the Casa Batlo. It was amazingly beautiful and the early tour allowed us in the building an hour before it is open to the public. So worth it! There were only a few of us, maybe 20, so it was fantastic! The interactive audio visual tour was so incredible! There were times when you used the little device to point it at the room and it showed what it looked like when it was furnished by the family with Gaudi designed furniture. It was wonderful to get up close to everything designed in the building without a lot of people milling about. And the rooftop design is so beautiful! This was our favorite Gaudi-designed building and our favorite Barcelona tour."
"November 25, 2019",5.0,Fab building in Barcelona,I simply adore this building and I visit it everytime I come to Barcelona. Its so original and I never get bored of just looking up at it.
"November 25, 2019",4.0,Wow again,"Amazing design. We were too late to see the inside but the exterior is wonderful. Fun, friendly design rather than the typical urban design"
"November 25, 2019",5.0,Beauty and history,what a beautiful structure. both exterior as well as the interior is stunning. A must visit while in Barvelona. the audio guide enhances the experience.
"November 24, 2019",4.0,Great for the whole family.,Lots to see. Several different levels including roof top. Audio guides are key for this visit. Make sure to purchase your entry online as it is significantly higher at the box office and there are lines. Make sure to go next door to Casa Amatller for warm melted chocolate with bread. There is a nice patio outside with a swing.
"November 24, 2019",5.0,Amazing building,"Once again a must see, beautiful, amazing colour and detailing. Walked straight in no queue. All the Gaudi buildings do have an entrance fee, in my opinion this one is worth it!"
"November 24, 2019",5.0,More Deep History....,This one is very hard to describe.... even when you see pictures on phamplets or pics on the website.. it just doesn't make any justice... completely beautiful...
"November 23, 2019",5.0,seriously dope architecture,"Another place full of history, architecture, art... I definitely turned into a big kid, this was one of my favourite places. Beautifully made, every detail is genius."
"November 23, 2019",5.0,Favorite Gaudi House visit,"We visited a bunch of Gaudi houses in Barcelona and this was by far our favorite. It was fun to visit in the evening. The interactive guide was fun and the audio guide gave us a good background of the house. The inside was super unique and interesting. Overall, really glad that we visited here and if you are choosing I would go here vs. La Madrera."
"November 23, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Home Remodel by Gaudi,Do not miss this beautiful home! Every square foot is a wonder. So fun to imagine living there. I loved it so much I would love to go back some day.
"November 23, 2019",4.0,Great interactive guide,"A unique architectural experience for young and old. Maintained immaculately but not a museum, a living environment. Great trip"
"November 22, 2019",5.0,Beautiful gaudi,"Visited here as our last stop on a three day break and it is well worth the effort.
You can purchase three levels of entry, blue being the cheapest (and cheaper online)
The only thing you gain by upgrading is a visit to one extra room, and a photo in vintage clothes, neither seemed worth the cost.

Such organic flowing architecture inside, and the audio guide with a visual aspect to it is excellent and in the price"
"November 22, 2019",5.0,Another Must See in Barcelona,"A very busy place but worth the visit. The rooms, stairways and roof area are something to see. We were on a tour and got in quickly. If you can buy tickets in advance, do so."
"November 22, 2019",5.0,A wonderful way to see Gaudi home,"This is a renovation that Gaudi did for a wealthy family. It is rumored to be in the design to resemble ST George's story of slaying the dragon . It's a unique place and worth the visit.the area around this home, is very rich , like 5th Ave in NYC.
You will enjoy this"
"November 22, 2019",5.0,Amazing architecture and artistry,"Very simply, wow... this building shows the genius that Gaudi was. The carpentry, engineering and unique design were amazing to see."
"November 21, 2019",5.0,What an incredible building,"The outside, the inside and the terrace are just beautiful. The virtual reality that helps you see how certain rooms would have looked with the original furniture is really clever. I was blown away by every bit of the place - though I think our guide, Cristina Belenguer - made all the difference in bringing the house to life."
"November 21, 2019",5.0,Stunning Architecture,"Weird and wonderful house with architectural details galore. We saw it only from the outside, but there was plenty to see."
"November 20, 2019",5.0,Magical!!!!!!,"I booked the tickets online and paid a premium to enter the Casa at 8.30am to beat the crowd. When you enter the Casa you are handed SmartGuides that are a audio guide with a video feature that was very informative and well executed. The Casa is magical and well worth a visit. We have grown weary of visiting museums, historic houses and heritage sites. The Casa Batllo is fresh, whimsical and a refreshing change from the normal tourist attractions.
If you have time for only one attraction in Barcelona the. Sagrada Familia would be my recommendation with the Casa Batllo second."
"November 20, 2019",5.0,"Secular Gaudi, plus the zoning that made Barcelona what it is","Over the course of three hours, our guide, Jelena (a practicing architect, writer, and professor of urban history at Barcelona Architecture Center), showed us an early Gaudi building (Casa Calvet, Carrer de Casp 48, 1898-1900), then took us to Gaudi's later buildings. From the questions and comments in our six-person group it seemed we were on a university-level field trip. Jelena explained the original concepts of the Barcelona street grid, the anticipated building areas and heights, and how those changed over the years. We walked along a street where one could see the original building height and density and look into the block interior. At a later intersection, we noted the original five-story height of a corner building and the top story added later. Also interesting was the ""block of discord"" on Passeig de Gràcia — four adjacent modernist buildings by four different architects — with Gaudi's Casa Batlló at one corner. The entire block was built in 1877, but Gaudi redesigned Casa Batlló in 1904. Without Jelena, we would have missed the several ""St. George and the Dragon"" elements that Gaudi incorporated into the façade."
"November 20, 2019",5.0,Must see,"This is a must see in Barcelona. The architecture is amazing, ecclectic and fun.The combination of tiles used is really a work of art. The furnitures are amazing. The rooftop is so much fun.I highly recommend this than Casa Mila."
"November 19, 2019",5.0,One of the many Gaudi must see buildings,This building is typical of Gaudi’s designs. The tour was with headphones and you meandered through the house at will. The sights are amazing because every where you looked you saw another special sight. This building is both beautiful inside and out. The lines can get long but this house is special and worth the wait. I suggest that you see this building and the Casa Mila on the same day as they are only 2-3 blocks apart. This is a special home and should be on your must see list.
"November 19, 2019",5.0,Loved this house June 2019,I was in Barcelona in 2008 but didn't go in; this time (June 2019) I did get a ticket and went into the house. It was amazing. Loved it and enjoyed the tech that went with the tour. Well worth it!
"November 18, 2019",5.0,Magical!,"When you visit, you understand how genius Gaudi was and how much in front of his time! A must see in Barcelona!"
"November 18, 2019",4.0,Pretty at night,"Casa Batllo takes less than an hour to tour, and there is a line that forms daily outside. It’s lovely when lit at night, but is also pretty during the day. Nearby a lot of shops at Passeig de Gracia if you need to do more than one thing in this area."
"November 18, 2019",5.0,Amazing Gaudi's creation,"I loved Casa Batllò with its colours, shapes and furniture. The price is a bit expensive in my opinion but surely it worth it"
"November 18, 2019",4.0,Casa Batllo,"I didn't have time to go inside this one, but watched it from the outside. It was under restoration when I visited, but it still looked nice. I will try to visit this again on my next trip to Barcelona. Hopefully the restoration is done by then."
"November 18, 2019",4.0,Casa batllo,"Is a great experience and good place to see Gaudi artistic side and impressive mind views of architecture and style.
I found it a bit empty as there are no furniture inside and this might have improved the quality of the house."
"November 18, 2019",4.0,Astounding,Very interesting and amusing architecture. Unique and eye opening. Thrilled and stunned by the master piece of A. Gaudi!
"November 18, 2019",4.0,Another Gaudi marvel,If you love Gaudi this is a great example of his creative genius. If you had to choose one of his sights to see I would put the Basilica Familia first but this is certainly a close second.
"November 17, 2019",5.0,Well worth a visit,"We were really impressed with this building it is definitely worth a visit. We bought an advanced ticket as we were unsure how busy it would be, being a Saturday but we found it not too crowded for entry or to look around. The staff were very helpful and there is a large shop selling a good selection of items."
"November 16, 2019",5.0,Long Queue Mean Popular,We had a short time in Barcelona and saw Gaudi on the map but it was different Gaudi at different location. We only see the external building and not going inside. There was a massive queue as I hadn't booked any ticket for this. The building itself was very attractive to look at and so many people were just standing outside to look at the exterior facade building. It was very beautiful
"November 15, 2019",5.0,Casa Batllo,"Overwhelmed by Gaudi's vision and execution. A feast of color and architectural genius. One more reason why Spain(and Barcelona)should be on any world travelers list. I've been to Italy twice, and although it's my heritage, and would love to go back, so happy I picked Spain this go around. I don't even think I can call it a close second! It's more like a close first!"
"November 14, 2019",4.0,Fun and Engaging Visit,"Casa Battló is one of Antoni Gaudi's masterpieces and it was a ""must see"" for my husband and I. 

While tickets range in price from €25 to €35 (and more for different ""experiences""), we chose the €25 ""blue"" ticket as the best value for us. To avoid paying the extra €4 fee charged at the on site ticket office, I bought our tickets online on my phone on the day of our visit and chose a time slot in the afternoon which wasn't busy. Once you begin the ticket purchase process, you can see ticket availability. I received immediate email confirmation of my purchase, showed my tickets on my phone when we arrived, and walked in. No queue! So there was no need to buy the higher ticket level for the ""VIP access"".

Audio guides were included in the ticket price and these were not your typical devices. These were SmartGuides which allowed you to learn about Casa Battló through augmented reality. When you entered a room, you raised the device and a video played which overlapped with what you were seeing. This allowed you to see beautifully furnished rooms, hidden gems, and watch rooms come to life while reinforcing Gaudi's themes of nature and the sea. It was fun and engaging. Children would especially enjoy this experience as they witnessed rooms coming to life with swimming fish and tortoises. The commentary gave insight into Gaudi's inspiration and thought process in designing this house.

Highlights for me were the mushroom fireplace, huge stained glass window looking out over Passeig de Gràcia, and the spectacular skylight with mosaics in varying gradations of blue. The roof was interesting too, but my husband and I preferred the rooftop of Casa Milà which was truly spectacular.

My husband and I spent 2 1/2 hours exploring the house and we enjoyed our visit very much. It helped that we chose a time that was not overly crowded. In the end, we were happy with our choice of the ""blue"" ticket and didn't feel that we missed out on anything."
"November 14, 2019",5.0,Fascinating architecture,"The locals thought Gaudi was crazy when he designed this building. It definitely is unique, both inside and out. It's interesting to see but I would recommend getting tickets online in advance. Go early in the day before the lines get too long and the rooms get too crowded."
"November 14, 2019",5.0,Casa Batilo,"When you walk into this CASA you are transported to a world of curves, waves, and colors. The design is so unique .Make sure you walk all the way up to the roof, it is amazing."
"November 14, 2019",5.0,The building is truly a work of fine art.,"The outside is impressive but go inside and take in the whole amazing experience. The audio gives so much useful information as you make your way around the house and eventually up to the roof. What a genius Gaudi was to have the vision to make this happen. One of the most amazing pieces of architecture I've ever seen.

I love that the building is located right on a main street in an upscale neighborhood. You can't miss it as you walk the neighborhood during a shopping stroll or are driving by on a city tour. Imagine living next door! It’s a wonderful house to learn, imagine, and immerse yourself in the world and mind of Gaudi.

A visit here is a ‘must’ when in Barcelona."
"November 14, 2019",5.0,Superb,Had a great time . Well explained . Useful and worth for money. Kids really enjoyed. Hope will do it again.
"November 14, 2019",5.0,Mrs. Joyce B.,"Walked here from my Hotel. Beautiful, take your time and take it all in! Beautiful Gaudi architecture, tile work, wood work! Absolutely amazing and right in the middle of everything. You’ll be disappointed if you don’t go inside!"
"November 14, 2019",5.0,An Inside View of Gaudi's Vision,"The contours, light, and original elements all combine to provide the visitor with a much deeper understanding of Gaudi's work. The exterior of the building is quite stunning, some might say ""in your face"", but it should entice one to see what's inside. Since the building tour is multi-level, those who are handicapped can use the elevator although there are stairs that are not too difficult to handle. The roof level is fascinating with some unique elements. It's almost like walking into the middle of a
kaleidoscope. Perhaps not so interesting to children, but well worth the visit."
"November 14, 2019",4.0,Seeing from outside seems enough,Great architecture design by super human Gaudi. We also ate in their downstairs restaurant and it is good.
"November 13, 2019",5.0,Fantastic Architecture,"What an amazing building, what a genius Gaudi must have been to have the vision to make this happen.

As impressive as the outside is (and indeed it is), the inside is incredible, the beautiful curves throughout, the attention to details, the beauty throughout makes this a must see.

We loved it!"
"November 13, 2019",5.0,Stunning frontage but even more stunning inside.,The outside looks impressive but go inside and see the rooms which are amazing. The audio gives so much useful information as you make your way around the house and eventually up on to the roof. A Barcelona attraction not to be missed!
"November 13, 2019",4.0,Not for everyone,It was interesting from an architectual point of view but not really a full blown tourist attaction. The Gaudi Park is by far more interesting.
"November 12, 2019",5.0,Exceeded expectations,"Casa Batlló exceeded my expectations. The building is truly a work of fine art. We purchased the Gold tickets to skip the line and to obtain access to the furnished parlor. The additional flexibility was worth the extra cost; however, it didn’t do anything to reduce the crowd. We entered at 10 AM (with many others). If I had to do over again, I would enter in the early evening. The interior would be absolutely magical to explore on your own.

I enjoyed the audio guide (which is rare for me) and we appreciated the period photo that came with our Gold tickets."
"November 12, 2019",4.0,"If you are interested in architecture, you shouls tour this home.","Very unique. I think the tour is a bit overpriced, but the home is really a work of art. Lots of stairs. Go early or it gets too crowded."
"November 12, 2019",5.0,"Other than the Basilica, the Casa Batlló rocks!","Imagine taking a basically box apartment and transforming it into the Casa Batlló! Gaudi was a genius. It is like touring an organically grown house, or something from the Hobbit Shire, or just something out of this world. The feel of the handrails, chairs, knobs are so ergonomic, even in this day. The views are amazing and how I wished I could have lived, even in a little apartment, in this house. Other than the Basilica, this house was just unbelievable. There is a nice gife shop with limited items---and I bought a further explanation of the building."
"November 12, 2019",5.0,Amazing Must See,This is a beautiful piece of architecture by Gaudi. It is well worth the 17EU to get in! I was at first just happy to see it from the outside but it was great to go in. I recommend buying tickets for anything like this in advanced as they are cheaper online.
"November 12, 2019",5.0,Casa batllo,It was the best tour for me. I was able to enjoy sightseeing because it is friendly for Deaf American to follow the tour easily. Highly recommended for Deaf travelers!
"November 11, 2019",5.0,A house to remember,"My wife and I first saw the house in the morning as were walking along Paseo de Gracia. But when we saw it at night, it looked liked a different building. The lights highlighted the curves of the house, it was more beautiful at night with the lighting from within the house."
"November 11, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"One of the most amazing pieces of architecture I've ever seen. The queue was long but was going quickly. Price was acceptable, considering the amazing building. Will return!"
"November 11, 2019",4.0,Praise the magnificent Gaudi,"You will really like the entire tour with audio guide , and if you understand something about architecture you will enjoy it to the core, Gaudi is brilliant and especially artistic in the entire construction
In this tour they will offer a photo in retro theme and there is another photo near balcony which if you need , you will have to pay some euros extra
I would have really liked to add that to the trip ticket as well"
"November 11, 2019",5.0,A view of Gaudi’s Genius,This was one of Gaudi’s amazing home he built and it is stunning. As recommended in Trip Advisor we went in the afternoon when the lines were reasonable. The amazing architecture is like nothing you’ve ever seen. It was steep so we didn’t go to the top but definitely worth seeing. Audio guise was very useful and informative.
"November 10, 2019",3.0,Beautiful but this was not built to be a tourist attraction,"One of the hallmark structures by Barcelona's most celebrated architect, the Casa Batllo is certainly beautiful to see but being an urban residence, it was not built to accommodate the hordes of tourists that now stalk its halls. The Casa does do timed tickets as a way to manage the crowds but there is only so much you can do. You feel packed in and find yourself often squeezing by people on the stairs. I just didn't feel there was the space to really fully appreciate the structure.

It is a sight to see though. You can tell there was a clear vision behind the buildings construction and decoration. The roof is gorgeous in a way few rooftops are. Every inch was used for an expression of artistic vision of the architect. I also really appreciated the audio tour that came with the ticket. It used augmented reality screens but I didn't find that this feature added much to the experience. The narration of the audio tour was a bit pretentious too. Many rooms I found myself wanting to fast forward as the disembodied voice prattled on, guessing what the creator's intent might have been for every doorstop.

Overall, it was a worthwhile stop and for a true architectural fanboy, this is a must see. Just not at the top of my list for Barcelona visits."
"November 9, 2019",5.0,You have to visit this place!!!!,There are no words to express the magnificence of this fantastic work of art. It is a awe inspiring piece of architecture. You can not describe with words the absolute beauty and majestuosity of this place. He was a GENIUS!!!!
"November 9, 2019",5.0,This was my favorite Gaudí building,I loved this tour. You really got to see a glimpse in the mind of Gaudí. His thought process was so amazing and inspiring. He was really a genius. This apartment is beautiful and colorful. You get an iPhone type guide and it shows what the room looks like with furniture. It’s really cool. We didn’t get tickets before. We were able to just stand in line and get tickets. It’s worth getting tickets ahead of time if you want to save time and if you know about when you’ll be there.
"November 9, 2019",4.0,Early visit recommended,We paid extra for the early entry. This did mean when we were on the roof there were not many people and we had time to enjoy the magic of the building. I especially liked the light wells. The tile colours moving like the sea. The comentary was easy to understand and gave alot of detail.
"November 9, 2019",5.0,Fantastic experience an special audioguide,"Very special audio/AR guide. The positional video on the device gave a different, funny and fuller experience of the houses original purpose and decoration."
"November 9, 2019",5.0,Even better with the new audio visual guide!,"I loved this quirky house six years ago and last week I was eager to show it to my friend. I was amazed to find the tour was even better thanks to the amazing technology of the headsets. Now as you walk into the rooms you point the screens to the walls and they become full with pictures and furniture.This amazing house was designed with hardly any straight lines as it represents Gaudi's love of the ocean. Pointing the screen to the curved windows in the ceiling turtles appear, the fireplace comes to life and double doors reveal a chapel! Don't miss this! It's AMAZING!"
"November 9, 2019",5.0,"Worth to visit, beautiful","We enjoyed the time spent in this building. The ticket is quite pricey but it is worth. The AR app is fascinating and unique it shows how the house looked like in the time of family Batlló. The shapes, the colors are amazing. We spent here about 2 hours."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,A MUST-SEE INSIDE!,"Casa Battle is amazing from the outside and even more amazing inside. We had a private tour so we had all our questions answered and toured all the rooms, including the roof. Great pix. A definite Gaudi experience."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"We did the 9:15 tour and I would definitely recommend going as early as possible. The house was fascinating and the audio set made touring much more enjoyable. When we left, about an hour later it was much more crowded."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,Architecture Buffs,"if you have any interest in Architecture as an art form, this tour is for you, the deep thought and attention to detail by Gaudi are astounding. Amazing quality of craftsmanship, materials and construction for somethig built so long ago."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,Admission to Casa Battllo,Excellent tour and only takes an hour or so. Close to Sagrada Familia also. Interesting house that every architecture student should visit!
"November 8, 2019",4.0,Beautiful building,"We were passing around when we spotted this beautiful building. We found that we can go inside and check it out, however, I found the admission a bit expensive. On top of that, I didn`t want the hassle with young kids waiting in the queue. It looks really amazing outside and it is a great photo stop"
"November 8, 2019",5.0,Another Gaudi must see,"Just incredible, from the architecture of the rooms inside to the spectacular roof sculptures. The electronic tour is great."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,A wonderful house,"A wonderful Gaudi building inside and out. It is amazing to think that this was someone's home.
We had timed tickets for a 9.30 entry and although we arrived about 10mins beforehand we were allowed to enter straight away with no waiting in line.
We were given the audio guide which I recommend as the handset also includes virtual images as you scan the room ( including some nice surprises) that lets you see what the rooms looked like with furniture.
Fortunately it was not too busy when we visited and we were able to take our time and enjoy the house including the rooftop.
Near the end of our tour we were able to purchase a lovely photo taken on one of the balconies."
"November 8, 2019",5.0,Amazing experience,"Really worth visiting Casa Batlo’. All the family appreciated it. Adults, young boys and my teenager daughter. Very well organized with individual audio.
You cannot miss it if you are in Barcelona."
"November 7, 2019",4.0,Another great Gaudi building,"I have been to quite a few Gaudi buildings including a couple close to this one so I had to pop in this time I was I Barcelona. The building is filled with all the usual Gaudi design features and it really is a work of art
The ticket price includes an audio guide which features a camera to detect what you are looking at and then giving you the relevant spiel. I have to say this is quite expensive at £25 a ticket but the plus side of that is that is was not overly busy. This might rank behind Segrada Familia in terms of visitor numbers and sheers size but is is well worth going to see"
"November 7, 2019",5.0,Amazing architecture,We love this place. We have lived in Barcelona for 4 years and we love comming here for the architecture and view from the roof.
"November 7, 2019",5.0,Lovely exterior,The exterior is lovely. The interior was interesting. Though this was more like a one time thing for us.
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Absolutely do not miss.,"This was really terrific. The audio tour is plenty good, and self paced. You cannot get a true sense of this place without a tour. Outside view is just not going to cut it."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Loved everything Gaudi,"We toured many Gaudi locations while in Madrid, but the Gaudi Casa Batllo was by far our favorite. We loved the guide & tour."
"November 6, 2019",4.0,Interesting sight,My wife and I visited Casa Batllo and were not disappointed. My wife studied interior design and was amazed on the architecture of the home
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Surprisingly amazing!,"I absolutely adore Casa Batllo. This house was built in 1877 but was renovated between 1906 - 1906. The designer, of course, was Gaudi and this is now one of the UNESCO World Heritages.
When I first saw the building, its exterior facade had completely drawn my 100% attention. However, this wasn't the only attraction as there were so many things I loved about Casa Batllo.

First of all, I think its SmartGuide was a brilliant technology as it enabled us to visualise what's this ""House of Bones"" looked like in the past by just placing it in front of you (its audio also has 11 languages). I also love its colourful ""Patio of Light"" in the middle of the house, as it offered you a very picturesque view through the camera. (The best view was from its ""blue and white"" staircase and looked up from the Entrance Hall) Its Dragon's back rooftop, Entrance Hall, Carnival masks' balconies, the white colour arches in the loft....etc. were all beautifully and cleverly designed. Casa Battlo was my first visit of Gaudi's works, but it had already made me admire his remarkable creation, his use of colour, natural sunlight, texture and shapes were absolutely genius.  

We visited on a Sunday afternoon. I brought the Blue tickets online just seconds before we entered and it saved us 4 Euro per ticket. There was no queue at the entrance and we were lucky that there weren't many people on the day we visited. We actually had no expectation before our visited but it turned out to be much better than what we expected. In my opinion, Casa Batllo has got much more to offer than La Pedrera's, so if you can only visit one of these two, then I would recommend Casa Batllo.  

Tip: If possible, buy your ticket online. If you are uncertain about the time of your arrival, you can still purchase the ticket online via your phone at the entrance. It's a lot cheaper."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Amazing Casa Batllo,"We have bought gold ticket (skip the line,audio guide and one picture included).Casa Battlo is unbelievable building and it is must when you are in Barcelona.We really enjoyed it despite it was crowded.We have entrance at 10.30 so maybe it is better to buy for earlier time."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Fascinating,Fantastic tour especially for fans of Gaudi. This tour helps to understand more about the man and his life/artistic influences. The virtual camera was also very useful. We were able to walk up and get tickets to enter straight away without prebooking but then again we were not there in high season. Only criticism is that the tour was a bit on the expensive side.
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Many beautiful examples,The artist Gaudi used all of his techniques in this house/tourist attraction. Tiny staircases with many stairs and many floors. There is a tiny elevator but you must ask for it. Gift shope highly overpriced but full of beautiful things.
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Beautifully Inspiring,"Visited in 2017 and 2018 - am fascinated with the unusual architecture, captivated by the colours and not so hot with all that climbing up & down! The view from the roof is a bit limited from the front facing - but otherwise, it's a good view and interesting roof structure."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Less is More Part 411 - Flamboyant Fantastical Fishy Fabrication,"This is what dreams are made of. Especially if you like elements of the sea and ocean. Feels like living in an big aquarium. Surprising to note that this is privately owned. The conservation work is beautiful and meticulous. Audio tour includes a highly enjoyable interpretive VR experience. Favourite elements are the light wells, attic space and living room upward sliding windows. Crowded even during low season. Can’t imagine what it’s like during summer peak season. Allow 120 minutes."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Stunning place,Batllo house is incredible beautiful. Every detail is a piece of art. The audio guide gives you interesting information about Gaudí and the meaning of the house. You also receive more information on your email and a virtual visit of the house. This place is a must to visit in Barcelona!!!
"November 5, 2019",5.0,Sublime Architecture,"After the Sagrada Familia this is unquestionably the next best example Gaudi's work in Barcelona. It should not be missed. We paid the few Euros more for the Early Access pass at 8:30 in the morning and I believe it was a good choice. Once inside no one dictates a pace and when we let the small 8:30 surge pass on we were able to enjoy the space with few competitors. Obviously this was easier in October than it would have been in July. The audio/video guide is marvelous and although the actual home is now not furnished allows you to simultaneously see what it is like with full period trappings. Seeing this home made me far more aware of Gaudi's brilliant attention to detail and careful engineering of small details, for example how the famous salon windows when opened would leave no distracting frame between them. Show up early and take your time but do not miss this place!"
"November 5, 2019",5.0,Magic nights at Casa Batllo,"If you are in Barcelona whilst the Magic night rooftop terrace concerts are on, make sure you go! You get entry to Casa Batllo, the audio guide included, followed by a concert on the rooftop with a drink. Great way to see the building in the evening and enjoy a night out at the same time. Highly recommended."
"November 5, 2019",4.0,impressed architecture,"Together with Sagrada Familia, this is one of ""must-see"" places in Barcelona which attached to Antoni Gaudi. The virtual reality is one of things made the tour more interesteing.

Recomemd to buy tickets online to save cost."
"November 5, 2019",5.0,Amazing lines and designs,Well worth doing this trip. We visited on a Saturday and booked an early slot- 9.30. Not quite as busy. We booked the blue tour which was great. Not sure what else you could need as the audio guide was super.
"November 5, 2019",5.0,Don’t miss this in Barcelona,Wonderful home exhibiting the genius of Gaudi. The video tour they give you makes it a fabulous experience. Well woththe time and money. We saw this before Sagrada Familia and it enhanced our understanding and appreciation of Gaudi.
"November 5, 2019",4.0,Cool dragon roof,"We didn’t actually go inside the building, but it’s worth a walk past if nothing else to see Gaudi’s quirky architecture!"
"November 4, 2019",5.0,Casa Batlló is an absolute must see in Barcelona,Casa Batlló was one of my favorite memories of Barcelona. I saw pics and wanted to go here before I arrived. I was so excited that it was within close walking distance to my hotel. I was able to view it several times both in the daytime and lit up at night. I even went to say goodbye to it the night before I left. It is such an eclectic sight. I love the colors and the bone looking structures on the outside. I was amazing walking around inside during the audio guided tour. So worth it to go inside. Loved it! Antonio Gaudi was such an amazing man. I wish I could go back in time and meet him.
"November 4, 2019",5.0,Incredible!,"We decided to take a Gaudi tour in Barcelona. I did not know anything about Gaudi and was absolutely blown away by his creativity, designs and genius of his architecture. I became an immediate fan.
Casa Batllo was the first stop on our tour and we had an early access ticket. Lines are long and getting in before the crowds was well worth the extra cost. Our Take Walks tour guide, Almudena, was excellent. She was a wealth of knowledge and gave us so much insight into Gaudi's life and work.
Casa Batllo was incredible. There is not one straight line in the building. Gaudi's creativity and use of color and light, the curves, the arches, ceramics and mosaics all culminate into a stunning work of art. Gaudi was a genius and well before his time. Do not miss Casa Batllo."
"November 4, 2019",5.0,Must see.,An amazing building which is a must see! purchase tickets online before you go as they dont sell at the door.
"November 4, 2019",4.0,Stunning,"We didn't plan on this tour but decided to do it after doing Sagrada Familia. We booked the VIP tour as the queues to get in were so long. I suggest you buy your access online, in advance as the wait can get frustrating. The smart guide was good, offering alternate views of what the house actually looked like furnished etc. Gaudi was a proper visionary!"
"November 4, 2019",5.0,beautiful!,"this was well worth every penny! the early access enable the house to be viewed with very few people enabling some fantastic photos and a more enjoyable experience. at times there was only my husband and myself in the room! beautiful building, a true work of art. the audio guide was excellent and the visit itself hassle free and simple"
"November 4, 2019",4.0,Expensive but gorgeous - our visit after dark.,I give this a 4 only because it is so expensive and I do realize they say it’s to pay for the restoration and upkeep. But 29 euros for the basic ticket is a lot even with the best audio tour which shows you what the rooms would have looked like furnished. The place is amazing and in true Gaudi genius it is so creative it boggles the mind. Worth seeing for sure. We went after dark. It was less busy and very nice except on the roof you don’t get as much of the vibrancy of the colours of the mosaic tiles.
"November 4, 2019",5.0,So glad I did this!,"The Casa Batllo tour wasn’t on my list until after Park Guell. So happy I booked this tour! I recommend the Gold option, as for a few euros extra you get to skip the line and walk right in. Easily my favorite tour (besides La Sagrada) and I was able to get tickets the night before. Plan to stay at least an hour. Enjoy!"
"November 4, 2019",5.0,Amazing...,You didnt see Art until you see Gaudi’s work! One of the most amazing places and architecture you must add to your list!!
"November 4, 2019",5.0,Definitely worth the extra to book the early morning,"As with all Gaudi architecture, a joy to view and see his amazing innovative talent. Beautiful. It was worth paying a little extra to view the rooms before there are too many people."
"November 3, 2019",5.0,Gaudi has to be seen to be fully appreciated.,"We visited all available Gaudi buildings and places with each more spectacular than the one before or next...YES, as impossible as what you will see."
"November 3, 2019",5.0,Awesome,"Really great to know the architecture of Gaudí.
Just the right amount of details with the audio guide. You get on top some augmented reality which is more a Gadget but well, they want to be cool.
Definitely worth visiting"
"November 3, 2019",5.0,What Vision!,"I am constantly amazed by Gaudi's works, and his vision of the natural world, and how his work was guided by nature. This house is a lovely work of art and definitely a must visit. Buy tickets in advance!"
"November 3, 2019",5.0,WOW.....All I can say is WOW,"Talk about a crazy house! Yes, but if you take the tour and really get into the design work that went into this place, I think you'll have a good appreciation for the amount of work and talent that went into making this."
"November 3, 2019",5.0,Masterpiece,"Architectural masterpiece. It is highly recommended for people who are interested of architecture, art, innovation, creativity to enter the building and not settle for outside viewing. The audio tutorial is fascinating. One of the must-see places in Barcelona."
"November 3, 2019",4.0,Beautiful colours,"The interior of Casa Battlo is fascinating. The way in which Gaudí uses colour, light and shape are very impressive. The front facade is very eye catching and unusual. The rooftop is distinctive but not as large as Casa Mila.
It’s not cheap but it is worth a visit, although we enjoyed a longer visit at Casa Mila."
"November 2, 2019",4.0,"Amazing architecture, and vision","Not what was expected when signed up for tour, however amazed surprised at the vision of Gaudi and his architecture, beautiful and functional."
"November 2, 2019",3.0,Gaudi Residential,"This house is a magnificent example of Gaudi’s extraordinary architecture and design but it’s so packed with visitors, it’s hard to see everything hidden in the detail. The gift shop is on the expensive side and you can find better prices at other Gaudi sites."
"November 2, 2019",5.0,good experience,"nice stuff and a real nice place especially for kids
the exterior its amazing but inside its not such a big deal to see and the ticket its a little expensive for one person only 30 euros....but in the end was fine and nice to discover other culture and to see the history of gaudi"
"November 2, 2019",4.0,"A very interesting building, but wish there was some furniture like Casa Mila","This building is incredible and I am really glad I saw it while in Barcelona. My only minor complaint was that to get an idea of what the place looked like with residences then there was only the augmented reality guide. I wish there was a bit of both, I get the augmented reality is convenient and space saving but some real stuff would be nice."
"November 2, 2019",4.0,Enthusiastic tourists,The visit to Barcelona was beyond expectations. All the works of Antonio Gaudi were fascinating. We bought the ticket in advance so we enjoyed visiting Casa Batllo in peace and enthusiasm
"November 2, 2019",5.0,Great building and best video guide ever,"Casa Battlo is undoubtedly one of the best Gaudi buildings. I didn't know much about Gaudi before, but came out as a fan. Book tickets online and you can enter straightaway at your time slot. The video/audio guide including the augmented reality deviceis simply superb and tells us everything one needs to know of this building. Tge exterior facade is superb, but difficult to get a picture due to the trees in between."
"November 1, 2019",5.0,Don't miss Batllo when in Barcelona!,You will feel transported to another world when you tour Batllo! Gaudi was truly a visionary and so gifted. This was my 2nd time in Barcelona and I went back to see Batllo again. Will go back a 3rd time on my next trip!
"November 1, 2019",5.0,gaudy in every sense,"the sort of building a child would design if left alone with a pot of felt tips! Stunning, colourful, exuberant, cheeky and unmissable"
"November 1, 2019",5.0,A real insight to Gaudis process.,"Less hectic than the Sagrada Familia, this is the perfect example of Gaudis vision. A wonderful view of the city awaits you once you get to the roof terrace."
"November 1, 2019",4.0,Tourists,"Excellent visit. The hills and stairs rd s were challenging given our age, ut worth it. Gaudi was an imaginative and divers talent."
"November 1, 2019",5.0,Amazing,This was a highlight for me! I felt that being in Casa Batlo gave me a true inside view into Gaudi's sensibility as an architect and artist. I could go back numerous times and absorb some new piece or perspective.
"November 1, 2019",4.0,Amazing,"We booked a tour that included Casa Batllo, Park Guell and La Sagrada. I definitely was concerned when we arrived because the young lady that was checking people in did not have a clue as to what she was doing. I was so happy when she put us into groups and we had Oliver as our guide. Oliver was wonderful and very informative. He was very organized and we never felt rushed. Casa Batllo, also referred to as the House of Bones, was very crowded, especially because some of the rooms are extremely small. However, Oliver waited patiently as crowds dispersed to provide commentary and take pictures. It is truly amazing what Gaudi created and the techniques used in the early 1900’s. I would definitely suggest booking a tour so you can skip the line and by going with a guide, which will allow you to truly appreciate and understand what you are viewing."
"November 1, 2019",5.0,Spectacular,I loved it! This house is amazing! I bought the Golden ticket to see the Saló Modernista and I didn't regret it was gorgeous I could have stayed there for hours!
"November 1, 2019",3.0,Gaudi Casa,"A visit here is a ‘must’ when visiting Barcelona. Slightly disappointed that the rooms did not have furniture (just the one ‘private’ room), and it was expensive for the entry price."
"November 1, 2019",4.0,Amazing Work By Gaudi,Highly recommend this attraction. You’ll discover the amazing design by Gaudi. Buy your tickets early to avoid lining up.
"November 1, 2019",4.0,Beautiful master piece,this is one of the most famous houses done by architect Gaudi; the outside mosaic is just stunning; make sure to see also all the other houses and master pieces as the Parque Guell
"October 31, 2019",5.0,Amazing Architecture,Casa Batllo is a stunning and beautiful house. Is hard to know how Gaudi could built such an amazing home. Very highly recommended.
"October 31, 2019",5.0,Gorgeous Gaudi,"We bought the gold pass tickets which gave us fast track entry to Casa Batlló, entry to the furnished private hall as well as the main house and a small souvenir bottle of water. In October, there wasn’t a long queue to enter the main house, but the additional private salon was worth the extra money. It’s also cheaper if you book in advance online. The audio guides provide an interesting commentary on the rooms you pass through. The house attracts a lot of visitors, so you won’t have the rooms to yourself, but you can pace your own visit. Some rooms were under renovation, so you can’t enter. The architecture is amazing though - loved the original lift and the quirky doors and windows. The roof is something else. A must for Gaudi fans."
"October 31, 2019",5.0,"If you knew Gaudi, like I knew Gaudi...","This was an amazing and astonishing city home. Our visit to Barcelona introduced us to the works of Antonio Gaudi and this home was one example of that. Truly eye-opening and innovative for its time. I cannot make up my mind whether it was his use of color or the unique shapes/patterns that inspired his work that keeps you in awe as you tour the home.
We went with skip the line and used their interactive audio tour gadget and headphones. This worked very well as we moved about the building. A must see stop for anyone visiting Barcelona. Couple this with a stop to the basilica Sagrada Família."
"October 31, 2019",5.0,Another Gaudí masterpiece,"I got up and pulled clothes on then jogged up to see this and la Pedrera. I had to see them before leaving the city.

They didn’t disappoint from the exterior, no time to see the interior unfortunately. I’d suggest you make more time to see them than I did!!"
"October 31, 2019",5.0,Pretty impressive piece of art,The casa batllo is a must to vistit if you Like Gaudi or the modernisme in General. You should go there pretty early or get a Ticket in advance due to the long queues.
"October 31, 2019",5.0,You cant miss it.,"Very nice to look at, very nice architecture. The building is located directly at a main street so one can't miss it at all, as one can see it during a city tour or during a shopping stroll."
"October 30, 2019",5.0,Early Access -worth the extra cost!!!,"My friend and I purchased Early Access tickets to Casa Batllo' in advance of our arrival to Barcelona. I wondered if it would be worth the extra cost, but it definitely was worth it! Early Access lets those with the pass (and they limit the number) entry to the house 30 minutes before opening to other ticket holders. This gives you enough time to enjoy the intricate details and story of this magnificent house AND be able to take some good photos. By the time we left, it was very busy and it would not been near as enjoyable, in my opinion. This is a definite ""Must See"" while you are in Barcelona!"
"October 30, 2019",4.0,Fascinating,Excellent layout. Get there early. Compare the Gaudí addition to the other houses nearby. Very interesting.
"October 30, 2019",5.0,Gaudi knowledge download,"It’s a wonderful house to learn, imagine, and immerse yourself in the world and mind of Gaudi. Truly educational and enjoyable with the help of the audio guide of course."
"October 30, 2019",5.0,Magic nights at Casa Batllo,"My husband and I had a fabulous experience at Casa Batllo. We purchased advance tickets to Magic Nights, which allows you to tour the house for an hour with a cool augmented reality (smart phone and audio guide) experience. The second hour is a rooftop concert and two complimentary drinks as part of our tickets.

There were lots of people but not crowded enough to take away from the experience. It helps that you require advance tickets for the evening tour and concert.

Check it out for sure! It's really neat with the smart phone experience - showing you what the house would have looked like, with fun graphics too."
"October 30, 2019",5.0,Absolutely stunning,"A must see for Barcelona. Very good, clear audio guide and complete coverage of the house from top to bottom. Just so stunning right to the very top - roof!"
"October 30, 2019",5.0,Best of Master Gaudi,"Other than the Sagrada Familia, this is my favorite of Gaudi's. It shows his genius and real sense of making art functional. And in fact making the functional into art. I loved the louvered windows for ventilation, the door knob molded off of his hands. And my favorite was how he designed the light wells. Knowing that there is more light at the top of the well and less at the bottom, he put smaller windows in the top of the well and darker tiles and progressively as you looked down the well the windows got larger and the tiles lighter. Amazing creative genius."
"October 30, 2019",3.0,A nice to see!,"It is a building, typical of Gaudi's architecture, with connotations of water, sea and oceans. The overall visit does not take more than an hour. It is a privately held attraction, maybe it is for this that is it so expensive. I think a ticket of 15 Euro would be more than enough. All in all, it is a nice to see (not a must see) building, if not chosen this you can go alternatively to Pedrera."
"October 29, 2019",5.0,Amazing,This was a wonderful experience even before we got to the casa. So much information is sent via email to make your visit enjoyable and a success. The information and augmented reality of the tour is incredible. We had general admission tickets for first time slot and it wasn't too crowded but the crowds had built by the time we left. It is really an amazing place.
"October 29, 2019",5.0,Saw it from the bus,This building looks amazing from the outside. All of the architecture by Gaudi in Barcelona looked amazing. I wish we would’ve had more time in Barcelona to see the inside.
"October 29, 2019",5.0,Mystical Casa Batlio,Explore every corner of Casa Batlio with the simulated audio guide. Loved how beautiful is this works of art by Gaudi where he really released all his imagination and creativity. A must visit when in Barcelona.
"October 28, 2019",5.0,Magical Casa Batlio,"The audio guide providing simulated furnished zones was helpful. Found that the interior needed refurbishment badly. They were doing restoration works in the dining hall, and this was closed off. Please take your time to admire and appreciate every corner of the Casa. I absolutely enjoyed my tour."
"October 28, 2019",5.0,Cool even if not into art,I’m not really into art much. But this house was neat and entertaining even for me. Really imaginative. Cool colors and lighting. Definitely worth a visit.
"October 28, 2019",5.0,Worth the Admission,"To fully understand the genius of Gaudi's designs, you need to visit Casa Batllo. The admission with audio guide is steep, but well worth it. They have clearly redefined the audio guide concept by adding virtual reality that helps you visualize the building's features. And the building is just so over-the-top quirky and amazing.
Note - it can be very crowded even with the timed tours. Buy tickets online and shoot for a time of day when it is least crowded (noted on the website). Also, don't get behind one of those cruise ship tour groups - their guides talk loudly and can interrupt your audio tour. And, it didn't seem like they shared anything that wasn't in the audio tour (actually, less detail!)."
"October 27, 2019",4.0,My favourite if Gaudi’s houses,"Exhausted, I made sure I got there. Sorry couldn’t go back to see it at night must be splendid. Day time viewing just as magical. I did not go inside, I don’t like crowds of people."
"October 27, 2019",4.0,A beautiful Gaudi experience,"We had the pleasure of visiting Casa Batllo in September 2019.
During the tour you are guided by an interesting audio/ visual guide that provided background information on Gaudi as well as the building. The entire design of the building is made to seem like you are under water. Everywhere you turned there was something intriguing and beautiful to be seen.
We bought the ‘blue’ ticket pass which fit our needs just fine. I personally don’t see the benefit of the other tickets especially since there is additional cost for those tickets.
I would personally recommend that you purchase tickets ahead of time to save time and to ensure that you get to visit Casa Batllo when you want."
"October 27, 2019",3.0,The complexity of Casas,Yet another creation of Goudi in creating a Casa truly befitting the might and powerful. The exquisite inside work shows how much details is looked into in designing and construction of this building
"October 27, 2019",5.0,just follow the audioguide,it was a fantastic and unforgettable experience. I love the beautiful decorations and considerate designs in every detail. you can leave your words in a notebook~
"October 27, 2019",5.0,Go for the magic nights,"The building was intriguing. And a must if you are a Gaudi fan. Definitely unlike any building you have ever seen. If you are in Barcelona, you should visit at least one of the famous Gaudi Casa’s, and I chose this. I coincided my visit with the magic night concert at the rooftop. I highly recommend catching the concert. It was truly magically, and if you are a couple it would be romantic."
"October 26, 2019",4.0,Beautiful,Wow. What a beautiful building. Typical Gaudi. Quite pricey to visit inside. Lovely just to look at.
"October 26, 2019",5.0,One really nice and special house,"Visited several Gaudi sites on the trip, and this was favorite one: fabulous example of his work and influence on the architecture at large. Audio guide with augmented reality was also pretty cool and I would recommend it."
"October 25, 2019",4.0,Just see it,"Just see it! The wait was long and exhausting and we never made it inside but we hear its amazing. From the outside, it looks great!"
"October 25, 2019",5.0,simply amazing,"Gaudi was a genius, and this is one of the houses he renovated in Barcelona. Take the tour, and you will evidence of his genius in the light, color, design and details of this phenomenal structure. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Barcelona."
"October 25, 2019",4.0,Beautiful Gaudi building,We chose the option to pay a bit extra and gain entry early at 8.30 before the 9am opening time and we were very glad we did. We then had the opportunity to explore this beautiful building and take photos without having to compete with the crowds who come later on. They also have a very nice gift shop with quality souvenirs
"October 25, 2019",5.0,Masterpiece,"Casa Batllo is worth visiting. I was so amazed by the audio guide, it is very engaging and informative. It was actually the first time that I enjoyed audio guide. The Casa really showed how gifted Gaudi is. We even upgraded our ticket to Gold because we cant get enough of it."
"October 24, 2019",3.0,I had VIP pass,"The house is amazing and the 3D guide tour is fine. You pay to rent the equipment...I had the VIP pass and the Lady at the entrance didn't even check my ticket and asked me to wait outside, so I waited 10 minutes and tried again as I saw people inside, she said it wasn't open yet. I went in again and another guy asked me to see my ticket and then he told her to let me in as I had a VIP ticket... she gave me the equipment with a face..."
"October 24, 2019",5.0,Beautiful at Night,One of the many beautiful buildings by Gaudi represented throughout Barcelona. We visited at night and the lighting really highlights the building.
"October 24, 2019",4.0,Magnificance right on the street,We walked up from the metro on the way to our hotel and tripped over Casa Batilio. Fabulous building and so much detail to feast your eyes on.
"October 23, 2019",5.0,Especially beautiful at night,"I did the early-bird tour of Casa Batlló, allowing me to see this amazing property, including the mosaic-laden dragon rooftop, before the crowds hit. If you are a Gaudi fan, you will enjoy this site. The tour lets you see all of the good stuff, including the back patio and the lovely rooftop, as well as the ornate front windows that view Passieg de Gracia. Walk by at night and be blown away by the color and detail. Be sure to buy your tickets online ahead of time to avoid lines."
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Highlight of my trip in Barcelona,"I wasn't planning to buy the ticket to go inside the house since it is a bit expensive, but I decided that I would on a whim, and I was so glad I did. It was easily the highlight of my trip as I was guided through the interior with he audio guide, which allowed me to learn about Gaudi's inspiration and the functional aspects of his designs. His vision was truly incredible. It is something you can do alone, at your own pace. Personally, I spend about three hours here, but you can definitely do it in one. Profits gained from the ticket sales are used for the upkeep of the building since Gaudi wanted his buildings to be funded by the people and not private corporations. If you are looking tp spend a few hours discovering the thought process behind beautiful and innovative architecture, Casa Battó is not to be missed."
"October 22, 2019",5.0,See it at night,Get there early in the day - like 7am - if you want to bet the lines. But the best outside view is at night. When this place is lit up it's breath taking!!
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Work of art!,"Having never come across much of Gaudi’s work, I can say I’m a convert; what a fantastically vivid way he had of expressing himself through art. A little pricy but slightly cheaper tickets on the internet than on the door."
"October 22, 2019",5.0,"Crazy, beautiful building","Amazing piece of architecture, very interesting, great interactive smart guide. Well worth a visit. Great items in the shop too, very easy to spend quite a bit of money! Easy entrance with mobile tickets booked in advance."
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Superb,"The quality of the design and craftsmanship is exquisite. You'd expect nothing less from Gaudi, absolute genius!"
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Beautiful blue!,"Loved touring one of Gaudi's houses that is not the Sagrada Familia. A different detour - but nonetheless still fun, captivating, and artsy."
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,My fourth time in Barcelona and I’ve only just done this. I loved it. The Gaudi architecture is fabulous. I found the handheld guide really easy to use. I also managed to buy a ticket online just an hour before I wanted to visit which made the entrance process quick and easy. Obviously not the height of summer so it might be different then. It only takes approx an hour but well worth it.
"October 21, 2019",5.0,One of the wonders of the world!,Don't miss this architectural monument by Gaudi! There is nothing else like it! From one of the greatest world architects!
"October 21, 2019",5.0,One of the wonders of the world!,Don't miss this extraordinary Gaudi architectural monument. Bonus: Located on the gorgeous Gloria Blvd.!
"October 21, 2019",5.0,"Gaudi's Casa Batllo, Barcelona.","If there's one place you must visit in Barcelona this is it. The entire house is a veritable piece of art. Each and every room, a wonder to see and experience. This is Gaudi at his freeest and best. Every door, every window a piece of art. Walls, ceilings, floors referencing pools of water, waves and the sea.
We thought this was a tour with a guide but were very satisfied with the narration over the headphones we were given. And happy we got the gold premium tour. No waiting in line!"
"October 21, 2019",1.0,What Would You Do?,"I was excited to see this venue as I have visited all the other Gaudi places and truly was looking forward to it. Delta Airline informed me of the riots and the Barcelona Airport closure and offered to reschedule or refund my ticket for another flight. Because I am 73 years old, female and travel alone I decided to exchange my ticket for a future trip in 2020. I requested a refund more than 4 days before the scheduled tour, well before the normal deadline, but was told I could not receive a refund. Very disappointed with the owners and operators of this beautiful venue."
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Fabulous place!,"If you have limited time in Barcelona, this is one place to visit for sure! The house is incredible and we were lucky that there wasn't a line to get in and very few people were there while we visited. If you go in the early evening, you get a sense of the building in daylight and at night. Just fabulous!"
"October 21, 2019",4.0,Beautiful,"Roaming around Las Ramblas you will find the Casa Batllo one of the famous design by Gaudi, Since we didn't bought the ticket in advance we didn't have chance to see and explore the inside of Casa Batllo, From outside interior its absolutely amazing 😉 ~ beautiful. Better to book your ticket ahead of time..Must visit !"
"October 21, 2019",4.0,this is probably the most recognized,"Of all the Gaudi apartments in Barcelona, this is probably the most recognized (it's also a UNESCO World Heritage site). Visiting Barcelona is inevitably going to result in you seeing some of the masterpieces that Anton Gaudi left scattered around the city.

Casa Batllo was one of his more famous houses and one which is entirely open to the public for viewing. Gaudi himself loved this area of the city, and his home was located here. Sitting down the street from Casa Mila, Casa Batllo is known for its vibrant colors, intricate tile work, and skeletal terraces. When you take the audio tour, you will be issued with an audio guide to take you around the rooms, which explains all the highlights of the building, as well as the history behind its construction and why there is not a single straight line in this house.

Fun Fact: The roof of this house particular depicts the dragon's scaly back while the skeletal balconies and boney windows are said to represent the dragon's previous victims (the legend goes that someone would be sacrificed every day so the dragon wouldn't take the whole town).

And yes yes, there’s an entry fee, in this case of around €18, but this is totally worth it. (Take skip the line ticket)"
"October 21, 2019",5.0,A must see!,Its on a busy street and its something to see. Photos from books and movies cant give it justice. Make sure you check it out.
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Must see,I love architecture so this is a true highlight for me. But even if you dont care about Gaudi it is still fun to visit. Walking on the roof is amazing with all of the fantistical chimneys and nice views. It's not too crowded because they time admissions.
"October 21, 2019",3.0,Outside view only,"Very cool exterior, can’t rate higher as we did not have time to do any of the tours to see the roof or interior. Worth stopping by the outside if you’re short on time but skippable if you don’t have time for the tour."
"October 21, 2019",4.0,Fantastical architecture marred by crowds,"What a genius Gaudi was, blending organic design with function. Pretty smart guy who intuitively understood engineering.

This apartment-home was ground breaking in many of its features. The self guided tour allows one to see most of the building. The big drawback is the press of flesh you must endure as many people all push to see and experience the same thing, in the same place at the same time. Buy tickets in advance so you don’t miss an opportunity to experience this piece of history. Lots of stairs requiring the ability to easily move around. Most impressive. Cheers"
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Interesting part of Barcelona HIstory,"Great place to visit. Definitely worth avoiding the queue and booking in advance which is very simple to do. We chose to have the smart guide with augmented reality visuals so you can see the crazy inner thoughts of how Gaudi imagined this place to be.
The whole tour takes about an hour and is definitely worth doing. Beautiful interiors and fabulous craftsmanship."
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Best attraction in Barcelona,Love the tranquility... Was amazed with the variety on display .. Love to go back and take a slow walk ...
"October 21, 2019",2.0,Expensive for what it is.,Really surprised this was rated so highly. Would not recommend waiting in The long line or spending 25 euros to enter. Come by and take a picture of the neat outside exterior and keep on going about the rest of your day. Not sure why the admission is so steep here. I was disappointed.
"October 21, 2019",5.0,Stunning,It's hard to describe the sensory experience of Gaudi's painstaking work. The photos once he's before visiting do not do it justice. It is a whole body experience. Worth the trip to Barcelona for this alone.
"October 20, 2019",4.0,Great for pics,The long was too long when we got there but the outside of the building is amazing. This building is amazing architecture. Another thumbs up for Gaudi
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Amazing architecture!,If you love architecture and creativity this is a place to see. The detail of Gaudi's work is amazing. All the walls are curved in this ocean themed apartment building. Even the attic was a piece of art.
"October 20, 2019",5.0,A glimpse of Gaudi imagination and artistry,"We were taken with the form, the meaning and he execution of Gaudis genius. His ability to imagine and execute such an artistic design was verwjelmimg."
"October 20, 2019",3.0,Save the money and look from outside,I didn’t know whether to go in but was told I should whilst I’m in the city. I wish I had just ordered a beer from across the street and looked at the front. By far the best bit. Once inside it’s honestly not that impressive other than the craftsmanship of the woodwork on the windows and doors.
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Must see,If you are a fan on Gaudies architectural adventure of playing with the sea life in his architecture genius then don’t miss this. You can buy the ticket online and save a few euros.
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Such a beautiful building from the outside and the tour is great. Blue tour is €25 each and you get a full audio guide and access to the roof. Beautiful building and rooftop is special. Quite busy opens at 9am so id go early!
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Sunrise at Casa Battlo,I highly recommend the early bird ticket. Get to see Casa Battlo without all the queues. Just you and maybe 15 or so others who have bothered to get up early. Head straight to the roof to get the sunrise photos without anyone spoiling your shot. The complimentary audio guide is pretty good too. As it’s still early walk up the road a block and get some photos of La Predrera without any queues in front
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Well worth the money,We fitted our visit to Casa Batllo in on our last morning in Barcelona. It was an after thought. We were so pleased we did as it was an absolute delight to be inside this exquisite Gaudi designed building. The audio guide was excellent. We got there just after nine in the morning as our time was limited. This was an excellent decision as the queue was virtually non-existent although the crowd built up inside fairly quickly after that.
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Great to see,I chose this one among all the casa that Gaudi built and the audio guide was so helpful that you can visualize the times when all furnitures are there. Worth seeing!
"October 19, 2019",5.0,Go for the gold pass,"While it is pricey, we opted for the gold ticket pass and waltzed in without waiting in line. The audio tour that allows you to simulate Gaudis vision was very cool! We also got to have access to a special room and took a photo feeling like we were travelling back in time to keep as a remembrance of our visit. This is a must see while in Barcelona to appreciate Gaudis talent!"
"October 19, 2019",5.0,Wow! We were blown away by the incredile design of Gaudi!,This place will amaze you and confuse you! It is nothing like you have ever seen before! People wonder whether Gaudi was a genius or crazy! I think he was both! The results are incredible! He doesn't think outside the box for he has no box! I think he was a crazy genius and he did amazing things! I had no idea how important Gaudi was to our world! I have to learn more!
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Highlight of Barcelona visit,"We had a 9am entry ticket and waited only about 10 minutes to enter this incredible house. I do recommend an early entry, as the light is excellent and there are fewer people. During those 10 minutes, we admired the outside and watched the helpful video that was emailed in advance, which described how the facade had been restored to its current magnificence. I highly recommend the audio guide, which was well-paced and very informative; it really added a lot to the visit. If you see one Gaudi work in Barcelona, definitely see Casa Batllo. It was the experience of a lifetime."
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Must-see,We are interior design enthusiasts so this was number one on our list and let me tell you it did not disappoint! Definitely go and be ready to be amazed not only by the beauty of Gaudi’s style but particularly by the genius behind everything he made!
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Must See,"Absolutely fascinating! Even if you don’t purchase tickets ahead the line moves fast at this time of year.
It takes at lest an hour and a half to see everything. The gift shop is full of Gaudi merchandise but good quality."
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Great place to visit,"A wonderful place to visit. Having the audio guide was a must. When you listened and looked, everything became logical, e.g. the difference in the width of the windows, the ventilation system."
"October 18, 2019",3.0,October 2019 visit,"I booked the Gold package. I arrived earlier than my time slot, and was allowed to go in straight away. The headphones did not work very well. The vintage portrait was nice, but I did not have my ticket checked. The modernist Hall was not worth paying extra for. The smartguide was good. There was a nice, big gift shop. Most of the machines inside Casa Batllo, selling coins were out of stock, and when I asked if they sold them in the shop, they did not. There was only one toilet in the building, which led to a long queue."
"October 18, 2019",5.0,First visit,We were on the Hop on Hop of bus and we were told to look out for this building on our tour. Lucky for us the bus stopped at this location so we could get off and have a look at the design and take photo's along with the rest of the visitors to this area. The design work on the front of this building is first class something I havent seen in a long time. Its well worth a visit that's for sure.
"October 17, 2019",5.0,"Spectacular architecture, Gaudi was a genious","We bought the gold ticket to bypass the lines and was able to enter right at our time of 10:30a. Well run self-guided tour with clear postings of audio guide stops. Gaudi's attention to detail was amazing (window knobs designed to match a user's hand, venting systems, etc.). Though crowded we were able to move thru the casa at a desired pace."
"October 17, 2019",4.0,Building amazing. Visit could be better managed.,"There's no doubt about it, Casa Battlo is worth a visit. The building is just as amazing as the hype and photos suggest. We arrived about 10 minutes before our booked-months-in-advance timed ticket indicated, waited in a long line and were through the entrance doors almost exactly when expected. We were given a ""smart guide"" with basic instructions about turning it on and pressing the appropriate button. What wasn't made clear is that the audio guide is also a video guide showing you what the rooms would have looked like furnished. Very clever. Luckily we figured it out by the second room but reading other reviews I see that this is a common complaint. By the time we got to room 6 the signage was no longer clear, the rooms were getting hot and visitors were trying to go two ways in very narrow corridors and stairways. Added to this were the many folks holding up the crowds by trying to get photos with no other people in them and even more folks taking ridiculous selfies. By the time I got to room 11 (out of 14), my smart guide had packed it in and I was heading for the door. As I handed my smart guide to a staff member, I mentioned that it was no longer working and it was put aside. But when my husband mentioned his guide had some glitches, it went back on the pile of good ones. There are just too many people per time slot, too many selfies and possibly not enough staff to make this an excellent visit."
"October 17, 2019",5.0,Unmissable,I loved this and thought the augmented reality guide was fantastic. It was the first time I had visited any Gaudi property and it was so good. I would highly recommend this and thought it showed Barcelona off well from the top.
"October 17, 2019",4.0,Walking through a piece of Art,"If you can ignore & cope with the masses of tourists throughout your visit, really a must do attraction while in Barcelona. Highly recommend the gold pass access, worth just for the queue jump, but also quite peacefully journey into the saloon, and fun vintage photo souvenir, this place will always be busy no matter what time you go, it’s an amazing piece if architecture, beautiful and innovative"
"October 17, 2019",3.0,Too Crowded to Enjoy,"This is clearly a popular place and I assumed that since there was a timed entry, perhaps it would have been more reasonable number of people at any given time. That was not the case at all. The site itself is quite amazing, but it was just not very fun given the crowd size."
"October 16, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Self guided tour of this beautiful attraction.
Informative and well done narrative.
Purchasing tickets prior to arrival was perfect."
"October 16, 2019",4.0,Rippled and swirled dreamscape crowned by a majestic sea dragon,Timed tickets are great but don't be fooled the place is always busy and the signs inside the building aren't that easy to follow. It is almost impossible to get close to the roof to capture its edge with all the selfie takers. Really? You honestly need 20 different selfie poses? The roof space was kind of spoilt a little by the lighting for evening events that make it difficult to get clear shots of the roof and chimneys. The building is being renovated and they are doing an excellent job of it. We had not been told that the audio guide was also interactive so missed out on a lot of the tour. It is a stunning building and well worth a visit and it is possible to get photos without others in it you just have to get creative...
"October 16, 2019",5.0,Very interesting building,We liked very much the unusual architecture and the solutions. I studied architecture in college and always wanted to see Gaudi's work up close. This building was very representative - liked it much!
"October 16, 2019",5.0,great VR guide,"I like the VR and audio guide very much. we can spend the time as long as we like, to take photo, on each floor and back yard, on the roof too. Gaudi's design is ever lasting !"
"October 15, 2019",5.0,September Trip,"This house is amazing the genius Gaudi had when he build it, He was way ahead of his time putting ideas in this house we still use today, vents in doors and walls using windows for excellent lighting, you feel like its a house of the future. Be sure to get skip the line tickets and go early, huge crowds and long lines await you with out skip the line."
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Great structure,"We loved Casa Batilo, having visited two years ago on our own, and recently with a guide from”Walks.” Beautifully executed, and loaded with creativity."
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Magic,"This house is where the magic is made:) wonderful based house, all regards goes to Gaudi! I loved it, the colors, the whole architecture of it .... loved it"
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Beautiful and bizarre,"Along with Casa Mila, Casa Batllo is a Gaudi masterpiece in the l'Eixample neighborhood. The tour includes the rooftop, attic and apartments and it's well worth the price. The VR and audio guides are great too. If you want to see a couple of additional rooms and get your picture taken in period costumes, pay the extra 10 euros and get the Gold ticket. Otherwise the cheaper Blue ticket is fine."
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Wonderful place to visit.,"Definitley worth visiting this, fascinating to imagine living here when it was a home and an absolute triumph in design and execution."
"October 15, 2019",5.0,A Work of Art by Gadi,"You definitely get a good idea what Gaudi was going for from the outside, but once you go in, you will be amazed at what he did. This is an amazing architecture, the curved lines/walls/ etc.."
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Another Gaudi masterpiece,"Gaudi , the doctor of arhitecture. Makes some of unbelievbles buildings. This is a one of this. A lot of colorit a lot of things to see. But it is a long line to wait to came in inside. It is crowded. It is hard with lilttle child waithing in line ,maybe next time."
"October 15, 2019",4.0,Nice but lots of people,We only saw it from outside because it was one of our last days and we didn't wanted to stand in line to go in.
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Love the outside...,"It's amazing to see, but I felt like it was enough to see the outside.I recommend walking all around that neighborhood if you love architecture as much as I do. There were so many gorgeous details there!"
"October 15, 2019",5.0,A truly piece of art,"You cannot miss it even if you did not know Gaudi or his art. It simply stands out on the Passeig de Gracia.See it at night and during the day time. Call Gaudi what you want, but he is truly creative and something else."
"October 14, 2019",4.0,Mermaid house,"Another magical spot in Barcelona is definitely worth a stop to see the outside of this building. My friend and I paid to do the inside tour which was fine but if you’re not really interested in Gaudi or his works then you could probably pass on going indoors and just get your photo op from outside. However, inside at the top of the house there is an opportunity to do a photo which she would pay approximately €10 to receive which makes a nice souvenir. The audio guide has lots of great information."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,One of a kind house,"A really peculiar house. There are many theories of what Gaudi was thinking when he made it but he never said anything about it.
You should see it at night!"
"October 14, 2019",5.0,Great don't miss it.,"Fantastic not to be missed Casa Batllo. The outside is amazing and with the audio guide for the inside it's a real treat. Why would you miss it? A great experience for Gaudi lovers of which I am one. He is brilliant and is the reason I came to Barcelona. Not to be missed are La Pedrera, Parc Guell, Sagrada Familia and Casa Vicens as well as this one Casa Batllo. I also recommend Palau de la Musica Catalana so very beautiful. There is so much to see I wouldn't miss any of them. Truly great experiences.Highly recommended."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,OMG - amazing,Goudi wanted a house to replicate the sea....how would you ever do that? He did. Go inside. It's amazing.
"October 14, 2019",5.0,The Amazing Gaudi,"No question Gaudi was a genius and when you visit this house designed by him you understand why.
Every little detail is something he thought of.
Well worth the time and money when you visit Barcelona.
Note: well worth to order tickets online. Saves times in line and ensure your entry time.
Note 2: try and come early in morning, much less crowded."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,"Not cheap, but definitely worth it.","We visited at 2 o clock on a Monday in October and didn't have to queue at all. The admission price is steep, but it includes a very good audio visual guide and there is a huge amount to see. I probably don't need to say that it's beautiful inside and out, and the design work is amazing."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place!,"Awesome place to see, very beautiful and inviting. No signs to ‘ do not touch’ book online as cheaper, still queue but you can choose time. Also see Other Gaudi places in Barcelona easily."
"October 14, 2019",5.0,Amazing experience,"The architecture of the building, the indescribably beautiful rooftop is a must see in Barcelona. Highly recommend the audio guide which is the best I have ever used (it knows where you are in the building). If you stay in some hotels, you get a free admission (Le Meridien is one)"
"October 14, 2019",5.0,This is a MUST SEE in Barcelona,"It does cost a few Euro's to get in but well worth the entry fee. It is obvious that Gaudi was way ahead of his time, the way he used the local woods and free formed tile mosaics, etc. He does everything except straight square walls like back home. What a fantastic place to explore. This guy was awesome, too bad he got run over by a street car !"
"October 14, 2019",3.0,Nice spot to hang around and take in the sights,"Go at night time, it's not as busy and looks more appealing with some lights shining on it. Is full of tourists during the day"
"October 13, 2019",4.0,Gaudi at his most interesting,"I preferred Casa Batllo over La Pedrera. I thought that there was more to see and more interesting. My only complaint was that, as usual, there were too many people there. Also, the first floor had poor ventilation and thus was very hot. But, I am very glad that I got tickets in advance so that I was able to visit Casa Batllo!"
"October 13, 2019",5.0,Beautiful!,I loved it all. Gaudi takes my breathe away. How did he come up with this stuff? I held my breathe with each new find.
"October 13, 2019",5.0,Unique home designed by Gaudi,We thoroughly enjoyed our self-paced walk through this well preserved house. The audio guide is excellent and the timed entry tickets keep it from getting over crowded. Plan ahead and get your tickets on line we’ll in advance of your visit to Barcelona so you don’t miss this treat.
"October 13, 2019",5.0,Well worth a visit,We were staying just across the road from this amazing building and loved our visit. The house is amazing both inside and out. Everything is so unique and wonderful to look at.
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Mostly Gaudi!!!!,Crazy and a genius is what we discovered about Gaudi!!! Nothing like his work anywhere in the world. A must see tour!!!!
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Fantastic experience.,Loved the audio/visual guide. Super cool. We walked straight in with the 'gold' ticket access. Wasn't too busy in late September either.
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Must-see in Barcelona,This is an incredible work of architecture. The smart guide is very well done. It has a virtual reality feature which allows you to experience the house in its original glory. Great value for money.
"October 12, 2019",2.0,"Great house, awful crowds","I feel torn on how to rate the experience. The Casa Batllo is a “must see” for fans of Gaudi’s architecture, BUT the experience is almost ruined by the crowds of people who are in the house at the same time. As one example, imagine a narrow, winding staircase, choked with people going both up and down. The people in charge, and raking in tens of thousands of dollars a day, need to cut down on the number of visitors in order to allow everyone to be able to really appreciate Gaudi’s genius. BTW - if you do go, buy a “skip the line” ticket in advance."
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Ms Ng,"Me and my husband when in the morning as they open and also join the rooftop night party, we are very thankful to see both the day and night of Casa Batllo, the atmosphere is very different and the rooftop performances is very good for the night party and they also included two open bar drinks..... you don’t have to take the Cava at the entrance, they have an open bar at the other end, we love both visits, the building and amazing"
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Casa Battlo October 2019,"Casa Battlo is a beautiful house built for the Battlo family by Gaudí. It is based on the legend of St George who slayed a Dragon to save a Princess. The outside of the house resembles bones representing the people slayed by the dragon, and the dragons back with scales(small colourful chips used by Gaudí). The inside has a beautiful wavy design and reminds me of an Alice in wonderland theme! Do make sure you take a guided tour and don’t miss seeing inside! Wavy walls and stairs, jelly fish shaped windows, mushroom shaped tiny rooms, illusion of water in different places, and the view from the attic are all enchanting!"
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Expensive but if you like Gaudí....,"We thought about booking ahead as it’s cheaper to book online but we happened to be passing early one morning and there was no queue - around 9.30 - so paid and went in. It’s beautiful, unique and we were glad we did it when we did. Few tourists taking repeat selfies in front of key images. We also did the touristy thing - the photo on the balcony 12 euros. We were given a hard copy and digital version of the photo which is a great souvenir."
"October 11, 2019",5.0,"If you only have time for one, do this","Most people say the opposite -- that casa Mila is the better of the tell, but I disagree. I loved all the colors in this one and we had access to almost every floor of the house. The guided VR tour was awesome because you could more easily see Gaudi's inspiration from nature."
"October 11, 2019",5.0,Stunning,Excellent value for money. Audio guide device shows virtual reality of each room you visit and the audio is informative and interesting. Pay the ticket price and go and see this marvellous house.
"October 11, 2019",5.0,C.B,"In the middle of town.
Shop till you drop.
And then you stumble across this beauty.
The architecture ALL around Barcelona is absolutely amazing. Everywhere your look you feel the need to pick up a camera.
Already making arrangements to fly back in a few months."
"October 11, 2019",4.0,Beautiful Home!,"This private home designed by Gaudi to mimic the sea is stunning. The audio guide was helpful, and showed how the rooms looked when they were furnished. I have no way of knowing if there is a good time of day to visit. We went at noon, and alas, like everything, everywhere, it was CROWDED! Very difficult to enjoy whilst being stepped upon and run into by folks videotaping every square inch, and not for a documentary! Still, a lovely place."
"October 11, 2019",5.0,Gaudi at its finest,"Very cool! Got admission included as part of Barcelona Pass. While Sagrada is a big masterpiece, Battlo is a very cool way to get up close and personal to Gaudi's unique style. Recommended to go about 15 mins before they open. That way you can be one of the first in and have the rooms and roof pretty empty to get some good pictures."
"October 11, 2019",5.0,Best way to see Casa Batlló,"We went on a Wed, skipped the line and leisurely walked through this amazing house like we lived there. No crowds great pics. So worth it."
"October 11, 2019",5.0,Another marvel of Gaudi,This house is another example of Gaudi's exceptional talent. The way he used tiles and natural light made him an extraordinary architect/artist.
"October 10, 2019",5.0,Cute house. Lots to see!,I was told by a Barcelona citizen this is a must see. I would agree. Buy your ticket online to save some money and get the audio guide. Without it you won’t get to learn the amazing history. It’s so pretty inside and the view of the roof at night was amazing. Definitely recommend.
"October 10, 2019",4.0,Standing on a corner,"This is really nice, on the corner of the street, which is quite easy to find, but parking is as always in Barcelona a problem. Although private apartments, you can go inside the front entrance for free and there is a tour of the first floor, attic and terrace. You can hire private rooms for meetings. Lots of tourists in October, it must be heaving in July and August."
"October 10, 2019",5.0,Best House!,"This is my absolute favourite thing we did in Barcelona. We visited all the main Gaudí houses and the church, but this blew us away. So so cool. A must see!"
"October 10, 2019",5.0,Another must see.,Amazing how someone of that era could imagine something as thought out for convience and design etc. etc.
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Simone,"No waiting in line and a much better experience due to a smaller group. As we were leaving, we saw that there were hoards of people filing through. A very memorable experience and a very informative audio guide. What an exquisite work of art."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,spectacular house,A very fun house ...architecture is brilliant....My wife and I truly enjoyed the one hour visit thru this home....you will too
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Great attraction must item in you schedule,"Great attraction must item in you schedule.we have visited in 06/Oct @ afternoon
Relatively fast queue lines
Nice to have the audio guide to understand more about gaudi"
"October 9, 2019",3.0,OK Gaudi Tour,"Casa Batllo was a very ok visit. The line was short (you can buy tickets when you get there instead of ahead of time), and it wasn't terribly crowded. You get a headset tour with an old IPhone that shows a 3D rendering of the house (augmented reality). Honestly though it was just kind of boring, not very many rooms were open and you were forced to walk up a rounded staircase to the top. This is where it go crowded. The architectural designs became repetitive. The rooftop was nice. Compared to Gaudi's other pieces, I would skip this one if you don't have time."
"October 9, 2019",4.0,Very interesting!,"Nice introduction to the history of Gaudi & a must see to appreciate. The pics are great but much better in person. Beware, once inside the tour begins with stairs & goes up several flights. I suggest buying tickets prior to arrival. Blue ticket holder line moved relatively quick."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Must visit.,"Built or better said rebuilt by the famous Catalan architect Antonio Gaudí for the Batlló family at the beginning of the 20th century, Must see."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Worth seeing,Gaudi was a very talented architect. It was amazing to see it in person and to hear the story why he did certain design element in the house was interesting. I would recommend seeing it.
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Go at night!,We got there at dusk and went inside to explore. It is very interesting. When we left it was dark and lite up like in the photo and was beautiful!
"October 8, 2019",5.0,A must see!,"This is a definite ""don't miss"" on your trip to Barcelona. Make sure to buy your ticket ahead of time."
"October 8, 2019",1.0,Very crowded and expensive,Compared to other main attractions in the heart of Barcelona this was the most crowded place and the most expensive as well. Also equipment for audio guided tour wasn't good and rooms without furniture could be visited.
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Awe inspiring,"Casa Batllo is a Gaudi masterpiece. His inspiration is drawn from marine life, the hues of the ocean and even from the Catalonian patron saint St.George. From the lower levels with the walls etched with a fish scale design to the different hues of the ocean that can be viewed at each level due to skillful manipulation of light on glass this is an architectural masterpiece. Gaudis architecture is both masterful and functional as the roof design will clearly illustrate. Chimneys and the Barcelona skyline are used as art and the dragon back pattern is traced on the roofline. Awe inspiring for anyone"
"October 8, 2019",4.0,Interesting example of Gaudi Modernisme,"It was enjoyable, looking at the various rooms, and seeing how Gaudi transformed what we think of as normal habitation into something more playful and interesting, yet still very functional, in some cases more so. The timed entrance seemed to be handled well, so the crowds were not overwhelming. The roof, though, is OK, not as extensive and interesting as La Pedrera up the street. See the other building on this ""Block of Discord."" PS: Do the audio tour, very helpful."
"October 8, 2019",4.0,Last day in Barcelona - Casa Batllo across from hotel,"We were staying at Sixtytwo hotel which was across the street from Batllo. We purchased our tickets for 9:30AM and went to get in line. Even though we had a registered time, it really didn't matter since lots of people were there and even if they didn't have a time if in line they got through. Only difference was we were Silver vs Gold which had little more leverage. Upon proceeding into the exhibit, we were given a smart phone which had not only audio explaining the rooms but a video graphic representation of how the rooms looked furnished. I was amazed at some of the forward thinking Gaudi had with his architecture and innovations. After seeing Sagrada I didn't think this would be special but it is and well worth the time. We were there on Saturday, so crowds are very large queing. I would suggest either real early or toward end of day for week-ends and during the week the ques weren't as long."
"October 8, 2019",5.0,The Best Gaudi's Work,It is a house to do not miss. Better to take a tour to be able to appreciate it in all its splendour.
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Architecture inspired by nature at its best,"An architectural marvel and hats off to Gaudi's imagination. This ia a must-visit when in Barcelona and be prepared to be amazed by Gaudi's creation. From the door handles to the shape of the walls, everything spells insipiration from nature.

To avoid queuing up, go for the gold ticket admission and audio guide."
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Batllo,"This is a house that I have visited before. On this occasion, my fiancée and I took her children. They and we were entranced by the house. The thought and decoration that went into its construction are quite amazing.

Your tickets give you an audio tour which is comprehensive and interesting. It can be quite busy by midday so I would try to go earlier in the day eg 10am if you want a little more
room. There is some construction work going on in the house at present. This did not distract us or reduce our enjoyment of the visit.

Finally, my fiancée and I are not fans of “ cheesy” photos as you enter or leave an attraction. However, Batllo has a camera set at the top of the house which takes amazing
pictures (see below) and we were more than happy to part with Euros12 for the photo which will feature on our wedding invitations."
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Casa Batllo,Stunning house . The audio guide was very informative and pointed out details that could easily have been missed. Book on line before you go as it is a popular site.
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Well organized even with large crowds,"The house is lovely, definitely something worth seeing if you have time. I felt this tour offered what I expected and was well organized even on a crowded day."
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Amazing Architecture!,"This building showcases just how brilliant Gaudi was in every aspect of design and building. The audio interface was very good, I loved the hand held device that showed what the rooms would have looked like furnished in the style of the times."
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Eye opening design extravaganza,This is a house Gaudy designed for a wealthy family. Must visit. Shows the brilliance of Gaudy. The movement and colors in his design are spectacular. Get the private room ticket. The decor is interesting and gives you time to digest the scene.
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Outstanding!,Casa Batilo is something to see for sure! Outside is amazing architecture BUT just wait until you walk inside! I was speechless in AWE of this humble magnificent place. Gaudi was a talented creator.
"October 7, 2019",5.0,nothing ordinary about it,"another architectural marvel of barcelona. Strange, twisted, but hugely attractive. Highly recommended"
"October 7, 2019",5.0,Gorgeous Gaudi,"I did an early entry and while a little expensive, it made the experience very personal. The building is a delight, the audio tour a nice touch and quite informative.
A must do Gaudi experience."
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Must must must,Loved it top to bottom. Love architecture and the audioguide was very helpful. Rooftop views where fantastic.
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Worth a visit like most of the Antoni Gaudi's building around Barcelona. Purchase the ticket in advance.
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Pay the money and get Early Access! Make it your first stop of the day,"We did early access and it was DEFINITELY worth it. There were people on the tour but you were able to enjoy your surroundings, not feel rushed, and get great photos without a ton of people in them."
"October 6, 2019",3.0,Casa Battle,"I enjoyed seeing Casa Battlo but from all the photos I have seen, expected more. It is again very crowded and everyone is always taking photos which becomes annoying. Interesting place to visit overall."
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Great building,Great looking building. Should cut down the trees in front of the building as it blocks your view and takes away from the building
"October 5, 2019",5.0,Amazing just amazing,This is my favorite Gaudi work. His use of color and light is amazing. He was so far ahead of his time. His use of the shapes in nature in his designs make everywhere you go in this Casa feel like the most soothing flow of energy. I just wish I could have seen it without so many people there but it's a popular tourist place. A must see in Barcelona.
"October 5, 2019",4.0,Glance into Gaudi’s life,"Wonderful audio with visuals to accompany. Would have been nice to have been given quick basic instructions with the audio. Didn’t realize there was a visual on the audio device until the second room. The gold admission allowed for priority entrance, but then you are dependent on the size of the crowd touring at the time. No control over numbers admitted and it was difficult to get up the many stairs with people stopping to take photos etc. Some areas had AC but it was pretty warm otherwise and uncomfortable getting up the stairs
Would suggest scheduling at the coolest time of day ."
"October 5, 2019",4.0,"Book online, augmented reality app is on point.","The place itself did a fantastic job; my rating is because I enjoyed other things in Barcelona more.

We bought blue tickets, it was worth saving my euros and waiting in line for about 15-20 minutes. We went at 1115.

The app is excellent, paints a great picture. Very informative.

Great showcase of Gaudi’s work. If you’re going to La Sagrada Família then go to the basilica first."
"October 5, 2019",4.0,Queue-jump with gold ticket,"Quite intriguing venue, well worth a visit. Quite busy, so you can't always get a clear shot for your photos. Quite a lot of steps to climb. But even to someone not much into architecture, quite worthwhile."
"October 5, 2019",5.0,Wow .. Wow .. Wow...!!,"This is one of the most interesting properties I have ever visited. It’s a MUST visit if you are in Barcelona. Buying fast-track tickets on-line was a good decision; making entry quick and easy. It was very crowded and therefore difficult to try and capture photos without other visitors in them. However, just buy their postcards and scan them in with your own photos – we found this to be an excellent solution to the crowd problem. The audio guide was perfect too and meant you could ignore the people and enjoy listening and looking at this amazing building. The roof is incredible too. As others have said, make sure you also view this building on the outside at night. It’s an enchanted and captivating property – truly amazing."
"October 5, 2019",5.0,Casa Batlló,"Casa Batilo is one of the most interesting houses that i ever visit! The architecture and the colours used inside and outside are outstanding!
I visit the house with my wife and my 6 years old son who was impressed by everything it was inside !
Gaudi rules!
Must see the house !"
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Fantasy House,"The Casa Batllo is the most original and dream like house designed and built by Antonio Gaudi - 1904 to 1906. We were a family of 6 - grandparents (us), our son, our 12 year old granddaughter, our son's sister in law and her 9 year old son - three generations. We bought tickets on line to enter at 11.30 am, although when we got there we still had to stand in a queue - it was a very hot day and a lady came along the queue to give us cardboard fans to cool ourselves down, they not only did that, but are also a memento of our visit. We picked up the audio as we entered - it is an excellent audio and very easy to use.
Then we immersed ourselves in the fantasy of a man who was inspired, but very different to most architects. Having said that so much of what is included in this building is very practical as well as decorative. We walked up stairs (there are a lot of them), along corridors, out into the upstairs courtyard, and into and through rooms until we reached the dragon roof. Yes, there are a lot of people, who all want to see everything and take lots of photos, but for many of us it is a once in a life time visit, so just be patient and take your time. We, my husband and I who are seniors, paid 22 Euro each but it was worth every bit of it - don't miss it."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Fascinating place,Really enjoyed visiting here and the audio guide was ideal. Loved it and seeing the outside at night is lovely.
"October 4, 2019",5.0,WOW!!,Get your fast pass tickets in advance. Amazing. Crowded. Even better at nightfall. The lights do a fine job on it. The Bone house!
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Amazing Visit,"We had not pre-booked and fortunately did not have to wait long to buy our tickets.There are three categories blue,silver and gold.As we were not pushed for time we opted for blue which was 26 E each as a concession for seniors.The Audio Guide-included-was easy to use and the commentary was very informative.The building is stunning both inside and out revealing the extensive variety of techniques and materials used by Gaudi.Access to the roof area is permitted but you do have to negotiate a few narrow staircases.There is also a shop with souvenirs etc."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Beautiful architecture and home,Although it is crowded it is well worth it to go see this wonderful home. The augmented reality adds to it all to give you the feeling as to how these rooms looked when it was a home. Go! You won’t regret it!!
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"The outside is really something to see and then when you go for the inside tour and the roof top, well lets just say you have to see it yourself as the architecture is so unique."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Stunning - a must visit,"Would I go again - Yes as there was some refurbishment areas that I couldn't view.

If you do not have a great deal of time then I would definitely purchase the fast track pass as you wont need to wait. You are given an audio guide which is excellent, very clear sound, great augmentation and great narrative.

Despite it being crowded, I didn't feel rushed (took about an hour at a leisurely pace) and I got to see everything I wanted to. There are lots of stairs (but there is a lift for less able walkers) and lots to see - I was blown away by the architecture and loved all of the curves, shapes and colours of the building - a very inspirational visit.

I purchased the Gold pass which includes access to Private Hall and a vintage photo shoot! Personally I didn't think the private hall offered anything more that what I had already seen and I didn't want the photo! But I wanted it to get the fast pass. So if you are not in a hurry and have time to wait in line then go for the Blue pass."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Antoni Gaudi’s Casa Batllo,"Antoni Gaudí’s most well known private residence Casa Batllo is an incredible piece of artistic architecture and should be visited by everyone visiting Barcelona. Photos cannot do it justice.

Ensure that you grab the audio guide (available in most languages) on your way in.

You’ll need to pre-book online and use the QR code that you receive online or via email/sms to enter. The booking will include your chosen visit time, don’t be late because your entrance will be forfeited. Book well in advance to ensure you get a time that suits your itinerary."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Can see how it inspired...,"Can see how his house inspired so many people. An enjoyable visit.
Need someone on stairway to remind visitors not to walk down the middle of the stairwell impeding others. People can be rude and careless effecting others making their way up. Needs control."
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Great experience,The tour was well organized and gave plenty of time to look though the house. The only negative comment is that there was construction on one of the areas and the alternative way to look through the area was not week explained.
"October 3, 2019",5.0,Very nice visit,"I recommend this tour.
The house of the sea by Gaudi.
The audio guide is great. Last 1.5 hours.
Augmented reality is used on certain objects
Very interesting."
"October 3, 2019",4.0,Better make reservations,"Being one of the most popular sites, you definitely need to make a reservation many days in advance! Note that if only viewed from outside, there are tall trees in front, so disappointing if you want a picture from a bustop."
"October 3, 2019",5.0,Just go!,"We went to check out the outside and ended up taking the tour. Worth every penny. They give you a device that shows via VR how the rooms looked decorated, and an audio tour of the building. An amazing , functional work of art."
"October 3, 2019",5.0,Good experience,"It was a good experience, seen some interesting things. Very educating and fascinating. I would recommend it"
"October 3, 2019",1.0,Privately owned business makes great architecture tacky,"This was the last Gaudi site we visited, after the park, the church and seeing his furniture displayed in the large gallery. This house added nothing to my appreciation of his work. Casa Batlló is privately owned, unlike most other Gaudi sites around Barcelona. Unfortunately the owners have turned what should be a place to appreciate architecture into something of a tacky theme park. It is clear that this place is designed to get as much money out of you as possible, with souvenir shops and stalls being dotted throughout the building. The architecture is lovely, however, it is not any more or less amazing than the other Gaudi works that can be visited for a much lower price. The much hyped augmented reality tour is extremely disappointing and outdated. The accompanying audio tour sounds like it is aimed at small children, being filled with sound effects and bad acting, it's pantomime like. Visit any of the other Gaudi sites in the city and save yourself the above average price tag that this place charges for a below average experience."
"October 3, 2019",5.0,What a night it was!,"Was Lucky enough to be in barcelona during their magical nights. I booked the gold tour of magical nights which had Smart Guide tour, concert on terrace and a souvenir (usually a photograph clicked in an ancient style).
After having taken the tour of the beautifully architectured Battlo, we reached the terrace to attend The Lexter Show. Lexter was amazing. Played all the classics and everybody was having so much fun. Overall,it was an evening to remember."
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Lovely but expensive,"Beautiful place, the audio tour gives great detail, but over priced for what it is.
go later in the day to avoid over crowding"
"October 2, 2019",5.0,It's Gaudi at his best.,See the inside too. Walking through this house makes me appreciate Gaudi even more. The renovation is spectacular.
"October 2, 2019",5.0,A Gaudi gem,"Went on my own with no tour and didn't buy tickets in advance (though is cheaper to do so directly through their website). Lucked out to have a short entry wait, but it is worth the wait. The audio guide is very descriptive and adds a lot of detail to the tour that you may have otherwise missed. I didn't get much out of the 3D part of the guide, however. I found it much more enjoyable to actually look at the real thing vs seeing on the small screen."
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Haunting work of a genius,"One of the most visited places in Barcelona, Gaudi's Batilo does not fail to impress. It is a somewhat macabre architectural work from the outside. One can tour parts of the inside as well but our tour did not allow time for that."
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Gaudi’s Casa Batllo,"Better than I would have expected, hesitated but so happy I experienced this master piece! A must see while in Barcelona"
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Interesting,"Very interesting, not crowded, personal very professional, we arrived 6 minutes later than we were booked and there was not a problem,"
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Early Entry only way to go!,Early entry is so great!!! Get yours and miss the annoying crowds in a smallish museum. Wish they had this one furnished like Casa Mila.
"October 2, 2019",5.0,"FAVE Gaudi, by far!","Casa Battlo was a living, functioning home, and its details are staggering. You can really appreciate Gaudi's obsessive attention to everything right here. Do not miss it."
"October 1, 2019",3.0,Great Architecture,"One of the many architectures by Gaudi. Looks great from the outside, but did not happen to go in as there was a very long queue. heard on the mix reviews inside"
"October 1, 2019",5.0,Well worth the visit!,I thoroughly enjoyed touring Casa Batllo. I would recommend the audio guide as it brings this Gaudi house alive. Very worth seeing as a way to get a fuller picture of Gaudi the architect.
"October 1, 2019",4.0,Interesting insight into Gaudi'd work,The tour was worthwhile to explore the unique early designs of Gaudi. Lots of beautiful inspiration to admire.
"October 1, 2019",2.0,Too expensive for what it offers,"The exterior is fabulous, Gaudi is a great artist, but I think 25 € (the cheapest ticket, if u buy online) is too much for an empty “museum”. I liked one room, the stair house and the roof; besides that, not even the informations from audio-visual tour didnt impress me. It’s just a turistic point."
"October 1, 2019",3.0,Great but a whole lot of fuss,"I bought the expensive gold pass,jumped the que that wasn't that long..no other benefit. The house is fascinating but just too many people elbowing and the usual characters having to pose at every vantage point with 5 different expressions and hold up narrow stairwells etc.. barely got a good photo of the interior because of the line up of posing. It definitely is worth seeing...just saying, great but a bit irritating."
"October 1, 2019",5.0,Design heaven !,So many beautiful features throughout this property . You need a morning to absorb all the information . It’s well worth the visit . It was busy so be prepared for that . You might not get all the pictures you want to take as there is a constant flow of human traffic . I’m sure the the night visits will be magical .
"September 30, 2019",3.0,"Too many people inside, original interior only in augmented reality","The owners of the building need to limit the number of people they let inside. Even the augmented reality app doesn't help.

Masterpiece but definitely can be managed and cared about much better"
"September 30, 2019",1.0,INFLEXIBLE CANCELLATION DO NOT BOOK !!,I had accidentally booking the wrong date and time and cancelled within no more than 5-10 minutes MAX and was confronted with a 100% cancellation fee !! UNBELIEVABLE!!! Do not book!!!!
"September 30, 2019",3.0,Worth paying for fast pass,"I recently visited this site and found it to be very interesting.

We paid for the gold tickets with the audio guide which was worth the extra money to get in. Many people bought the silver or blue tickets and the line up was extremely long to get in for them, plus it was raining. We were able to bypass the lines and go straight in.

The audio guide consists of the device the size of an iPhone and and ear piece. Through the device, you can see what the room looked like when the structure compared to what the room currently looks like. This I found to be a very cool feature.

The tour took less than an hour. The audio guide details the life and work of Gaude, however, I didn’t get the sense of what a genius he was via this site.

I am glad I had a chance to visited this site but it was not one of my favourites."
"September 30, 2019",5.0,Very very cool experience,"Yes, it was pricey. We treated ourselves. The Gold pass gave us a tour at 8 with the audio guide and augmented reality ...going into a living room not normally on display, with a free black and white photo 20s style, a jazz concert with a drink and sweets (!) On the roof top. Temperature was lovely. Gaudi House was so colourful and stylish."
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Fun concert on the roof!,We pre purchased tickets for the tour and the evening concert on the roof top. The tour is neat with the interactive phones showing you what the rooms would have looked like in the past. We were supposed to see a Beatles cover band but one of their members was ill. A Tom Jones impersonator was substituted. He was great - lots of crowd interaction. A fun night with great entertainment and wonderful views of Barcelona.
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Be prepared to be awed,"even in the off-season, this is a sight to behold; and many, many people come to visit; definitely consider getting the VIP entry (Gold line) that can be obtained online, as you can pick your time and go directly in without waiting. The audio/visual guide is well worth the visual experience. The entire tour is amazing, even while the interior is being renovated; the most impressive areas are the stairwell and the roof, although all parts are stunning"
"September 29, 2019",4.0,Architecture of Barcelona,"The architecture in Barcelona is alone worth the visit. Simply spectacular whichever way you look. Guadi was not on his own when it comes to wonderful, unique design."
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Guided tour of Casa Battlo,"Booked this tour through BarcelonaTurisme, tour itself organised by Julia Travel. Our tour guide, Isabella, was excellent providing detailed and insightful commentary. The house is beautiful, the architecture inside and out stunning, a true tribute to Gaudi. Crowds occasionally overwhelming as different tours come and go, but overall well worth it. Our tour at the house started at about 0845, worth getting there as early as possible to avoid the crowds."
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Fantastic Gaudi,Highly recommend a visit to Casa Battlo to see the architecture of Gaudi in full view. A very good audio tape to accompany you is excellent.
"September 29, 2019",5.0,defy the best of Gaudi's work,definitely one of the best gaudi's works. Liked this more than casa Mila and Casa guell. this road couple other of gouda's works.
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Wow.!!!,Only saw this building from outside but is easy to miss. It's in a rank buildings but visitors queuing outside helps you realise where it is. Beautiful Gaudi building and lovely colours.One of my favourite buildings.
"September 29, 2019",4.0,A Unique House by a very Unique Architect,"Casa Batllo stands out for its unusual charm, its authentic beauty seen thru the eyes of Gaudi. Every detail spoke to me of his genius, the colors alive with his spirit, his natural gift for using the very same characteristics seen in nature lending awe to each mesmerizing feature. Unforgettable. Perhaps because of its sought-after appeal, too many tourists crowd the casa and make the experience a little less personal."
"September 28, 2019",5.0,WOW,This is a must see in Barcelona. The Gaudi designed building is breath taking. Make sure you book your tickets on line to save a few Euros
"September 28, 2019",5.0,Barcelona's magic house,"Casa Batlló is outstanding. Details everywhere, art and surprises all around makes it an explosion of Gaudi's creativity and thinking. All details are connected with nature and you will be surprised almost everytime."
"September 28, 2019",5.0,The best Gaudi building,"I went with my family the last summer and I have just one word GORGEOUS. The facade is beautiful but inside is even better.

I think that is the smallest building of gaudi. Once you are inside, get an audioguide it makes better the visit because you will hear all the inspiration that gaudi got to built la casa batllo.

In my case I went on Summer time and It is the best time because on the terrace you will find people playing music and you have one drink for free. The prices as we know is now cheap but you can find lots of offers

I truly recommend La casa Batllo I think that is one the top places of the city"
"September 28, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"Well worth a visit ! I have been wanting to visit for a long time. I wasn’t disappointed. Went for an early morning slot to beat the crowd, it worked !!!"
"September 28, 2019",5.0,like visiting a fantasy-land building,"Genius or inspired craziness Casa Batllo has to be experienced. The details and flow must be seen. Having visited 4 Gaudi buildings, we rank this below Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera."
"September 28, 2019",4.0,Outstanding house to see more about Gaudi.,"Remarkable visit in order to understand how eclectic was Gaudi. This house could put you as part of the ocean with so many details showed at windows, doors, stairs, terrace, etc. This visit must be part of Barcelona tour for any people that loves architecture projects and its harmonized from the floor up to the top of Casa Batlló."
"September 28, 2019",5.0,Go and see it,"In the heart of the shopping district, this is certainly the most impressive Gaudi building to view from the outside. There is another next door and Casa Mila is just down the street, so you may as well plan to see all three."
"September 28, 2019",5.0,An excellent rendition of remodeling by Gaudi.,"You have to go and see these works of architect and art by Gaudi, truly amazing! THe guy was the Leonardo Divinci of his time."
"September 28, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Place to visit,What a beautiful house. We took the self-audio tour and it was very well explained and easy to follow throughout the whole house all the way to the top. Barcelona is known for its Gaudi art and it is definitely a must to visit his artwork if you are in this beautiful city. Make your way to the roof because the views are very nice and the sculptures and artwork will blow you away. Lots of tourists though so the earlier you go visit the better it is.
"September 28, 2019",5.0,"Excellent, audio guide helpful",Bought a time entry ticket in advance as one day it had a long line but when I went there was no line up (go figure). It's beautiful and interesting but hard to get good pics as it was crowded inside. The extra $ for a gold package isn't really worth it. It's an amazing structure if you like quirky architecture.
"September 28, 2019",5.0,Casa Batllo well worth a visit,If in Barcelona its a must to see Gaudis work and this doesn't disappoint. Explore in your own time but arrive early to avoid the crowds.
"September 27, 2019",5.0,My favorite Gaudi!,"I absolutely loved this experience from start to end! Gaudi’s work on its own stuns and shocks, so the way they organized the tour by giving you these cameras with imagined Gaudi pieces inside was awesome! It enriched the experience for me. This was my favorite Gaudi and I would love to visit it again"
"September 27, 2019",5.0,Beautiful and amazing,Its breathtaking. Definitively my favorite in Barcelona. It is magical and has a dragon on top. Worth the visit.
"September 27, 2019",5.0,House of sea,Without any doubt Barcelona is the most beautiful tourism city that I have visited and Casa Batllo really inspired me. Gaudi is an excellent example of the outstanding architect.
"September 26, 2019",4.0,Beautiful House,"The house is beautiful, really enjoy the visit. The only thing is that I feel like the staff wasn't really doing their job, we got the gold ticket and I really didn't see the difference. At the moment to tale the picture of the era was really confusing, the girl was sitting at the computer and we literally had to call her attention for her to tell us what to do for the picture, we then realized that it was the end of her shift and that's why she didn't even welcome us, when the next person came in we still have to wait another five minutes while they were talking about personal things and what was the plan after work which I thing is not professional. They need to do some improvements in general with their staff around the building, was also quite confusing to know where to go on the floors. But it is definitely a place to visit."
"September 26, 2019",5.0,Definitely a must visit!,Without my wife I would not have considered coming here. Would definitely encourage getting tickets before you come. Even with tickets we had to wait about 20 min. to get in. We had a high tech audio guide that had visuals on the smart phone they had you use.
"September 26, 2019",2.0,Fine to walk past but not worth visiting if it’s out of your way.,As a tourist sight it is ok to walk past but not worth visiting if it’s out of your way as it is out of the main areas in barcelona.
"September 26, 2019",5.0,Casa Batlló,It’s a beautiful place. Worth a visit no doubt!! Had a wonderful time discovering every corner!! It’s a must if you are visiting Barcelona!
"September 26, 2019",4.0,Unusual fascade,We did not visit inside as queues were excessive but external view worth a visit. We were unsure if the described 'content' would have been worth the Entrance Fee!
"September 25, 2019",5.0,Great experience,"Wonderful tour through Gaudi's building. Audiotour was great.

A must to visit, when you are in Barcelona"
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Early morning with Gaudi,"If you are interested in Gaudí’s works, this house is a must see, and the early access tour is perfect. For a few extra Euro grab one of a limited number of 8:30 entry tickets. There were only about 20 of us in the house for the 30 min prior to public opening (and several large group tours were waiting). I was able to get a first entry ticket the day before I wanted to go, but I’m not sure if that was luck, the season of my visit, or other. The audio guide is very informative if you are interested in Gaudí ‘s architectural and design innovations. The audio tour is completely self-paced and you can go in any order by entering the number of the area you are looking at. Because of that, I went straight up to the roof and essentially did the tour backwards. That meant I had the rooftop all to myself in the early morning."
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Incredibly creative design,"I loved the architecture not only of the building but everything Gaudi designed inside the house. He's a creative genius. He had reason for the way he design everything and how it all flowed. With your ticket you get a 'smart guide' iPhone that explains all of Gaudi's designs and it's super interesting. At the top, on the way down you can get your photo taken in the balcony of the house for a fee. It's a nice souvenir because the balcony is so unique in design. Do buy your ticket on-line as it's about 10 Euro cheaper. And don't bother to pay for the private room. It's not that much to see for the extra fee."
"September 24, 2019",4.0,Nice,"It’s not as extensive as Casa Mila, at least we liked that one better, but Casa Batllo definitely worth a visit. The shapes Gaudi worked with, are absolutely beautiful."
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Gaudí's Dragon-like house,"Absolutely beautiful house with a rainbow colored, dragon scale-like roof, bone-like columns, colorful stained glass, mask-like balconies, and mosaic terrace and façade. To see the details of everything and just to walk along the fantastic roof was a great experience. We bought the Gold Passes online to bypass the long lines."
"September 24, 2019",4.0,Tour and rooftop concert,Booked tickets online for an evening tour of the house and concert on the rooftop terrace. We really enjoyed both the house and the concert. The audio guide gave good information of each of the areas of the house.
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Casa Batllo,"Amazing, clean inside, friendly staff, easy to follow self guided tour, just remember to look at tge screen when you enter each room to see the decor, overall Stunning! A must see when visiting Barcelona."
"September 23, 2019",4.0,An enjoyable visit,"It can be a very busy place all year round and online DIRECT booking is a good idea!
With advanced booking timing can be a problem . It was a wet day and I had arrived rather early in the Passeig de Gracia and approached a young lady at the entrance and was told that with my ticket I could actually go inside earlier and not queue in the rain!
Yes, the house is truly remarkable!"
"September 23, 2019",4.0,Well worth a visit,"Luckily we arrived at a time when we didn’t have to queue but bought our tickets and went straight in. Admittedly it is some time since we last visited but our impression, true or not, was that whereas previously there had been some furnishings this time there were none. A popular attraction, it was crowded but not as much as some other places we have visited. We have been left with an overall impression of not only spectacular architecture but also of climbing endless stairs although, fortunately, there was a lift down for those of us with knee and foot problems. Worth seeing once."
"September 23, 2019",3.0,Unique but too expensive,"Wonderful and unique architecture
But 25 euro visit is too expensive considering it is approximately an hour visit"
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Must see Gaudí,Gorgeous Gaudí gem. Was surprised that blue pass gave access to entire house including rooftop. A little pricey but so worth it.
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Gaudi's most amazing building,"Casa Battlo is the essence of Gaudi's architecture and art. The nicest Gaudi building. It consist of very amazing spaces, marvelous colors and shapes. You walk through the house from the ground floor to the top (including the terrace and roof), meanwhile you will get familiar with the smallest details and secrets of the house. Not only the architecture but also engineering and the very unusual, forward and smart solutions by Gaudi from the early 1900's. The audio guide is a must to have companion through the tour.
We visited the building in the end of August on a week day (Monday) at 13:00 and meanwhile we were not the only visitors of course, it was not too crowded. It is very worth to pre-buy the ticket online; with the gold ticket you can enter with priority and no need for queuing. This kind of thicket also contains the allowance to enter an authentic room in the end where picture is taken about you in a costume. We also got a small bottle of water for free. I suggest dedicating 1,5 hours to full visit."
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Trip Highlight,"I knew I admired Gaudi, but I didn't know how much I loved his work until I experienced this place. I took my time and soaked in every detail I could. It's a little pricey, but I couldn't be happier that I went ahead and sprung for it anyway."
"September 22, 2019",4.0,Surprise! Surprise.,"While walking through the streets of Barcelona, we detoured from La Rambla and came across this amazing place. We photographed and studied the building but could not enter as it was ticket only - Pre booked and we had not planned a visit A really stunning example of Gaudi’s work"
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Barcelona,Barcelona is filled with artistic vibes wherever you go and this is definitely one of the buildings that will make you feel those vibes
"September 22, 2019",5.0,Gaudi house,The audio guide which explains everything to you and shows you how the house looked when gaudi lives there was excellent. You really see his vision come alive while walking through the house. You can take your tine and there’s no rush. Beautiful
"September 21, 2019",5.0,A Most Worthy Tour!,Book ahead to tour Casa Batllo early and avoid the sleepy head noon crowd. This house exceeds all imagination. You see Gaudi's brilliance as an architect and artist.
"September 21, 2019",5.0,Gold experience,"Today it was raining so the museums are all packed.
The ticket window had no line but the blue ticket was a long line to get in.
I chose to skip the line and bought the gold experience, which includes a period picture (value $10) at a private early 20th century decorated hall with view to the garden.
A better way to skip time and save money would be buying the Barcelona pass which would be skipping the line to at much cheaper price.

It was worth to save the time and the picture was a great memory.

Exiting the roof they offer a picture taken from a window that is $10 and must pay extra. We loved it too.

Excellent Augmented Reality video tour guide that comes with every experience."
"September 21, 2019",3.0,Nice to see,"This is nice to see and you should if you have time. If you wanted to knock something off you list to see...this could be it. Take the on - off bus and snap a few pictures outside and that will give you a great idea of what is inside. It’s not expensive to get a ticket, and a seperate tour is not necessary. You will see similar decor at Park Gueil."
"September 21, 2019",5.0,"Crowded, unique, must see","our second time here. I preferred it at night, but daytime is interesting too, especially for the central skylight."
"September 21, 2019",5.0,Incredible and well-maintained,This was my first time visiting Casa Batlo and I was struck most by the incredible terrace and rooftop. A must-see in Barcelona
"September 21, 2019",5.0,Amazing structure,"Gaudi was clearly a visionary and did a wonderful job marrying nature with architecture. Definitely worth the visit, but be careful as you walk though the building. There is no traffic flow and if you've got little ones, you'll need to keep them nearby."
"September 21, 2019",4.0,Great introduction to Gaudi,"Honestly amazing building and so advanced of his time, this will introduce Gaudi and his breathtaking creativity & designs. To think how this building would have been so different to the norm of this era! Interpretation of the scales and ridge back of a dragon, wow! Buying tickets online before you go or even when there, will be cheaper than entrance fee on day."
"September 21, 2019",5.0,Incredible,"Highly recommended - the detail that Gaudi put into this house is incredible - Maybe our best experience so far in Barcelona. You have to see it to understand just how groundbreaking and innovative this place is. Do the self guided self guided tour with headphones and get your tickets on line - you can pick a time when it’s not as crowded, but be sure to go. A remarkable building made even more so when you realize when it was built"
"September 21, 2019",3.0,Great architecture but crowded and a bit expensive,"Great to learn about Gaudi and his work, and to see this unusual house; however, there are many examples in the city and given the crowds, wasn't worth the high ticket price."
"September 21, 2019",4.0,another master piece from Gaudi,the building is marvelous. But there are too many visitors. No elevator. People going up and down sharing the same stairs makes crowded. Do not forget to take a picture at the balcony on the top floor (12 euro)
"September 20, 2019",4.0,Crazy busy and crazy expensive,"Casa Batllo is beautiful and Gaudi's achievements in architecture and stunning. But. The crowds are crazy and you can't enjoy the visit because of the constant stream of people pushing you around. On top of that, they charge you 25€ for the most basic visit and inside you learn that you have to pay additional 10€ for the best part of the exhibition. What a rip-off! Then they try to charge you additional 12€ for a photo on the balcony. Geez..."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,Beautiful and Fun (and Costly),"Expensive but great. The audio tour included along with the iphone augmented reality part was terrific. They're doing a great job restoring the building. Wish it was cheaper but hey, the price is paying for the restoration. Didn't pay to skip the line or the golden room--there was practically no line when I went and I didn't want to add to the excessive cost of the admission ticket. Casa Mila is probably the better building but Casa Batllo is the better tour."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,Oh My Gaudi!!,"What else is there to say besides GO NOW! What a beautiful place.
The brilliance of Gaudi is evident in such a gorgeous and thoughtful design."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"This was tour was well worth the money! Buy your tickets online prior to going. You can chose the time you'd like to go. When you arrive then you're not stuck standing in line waiting to purchase a ticket to get in. That line is far longer and doesn't move as fast as the line if you're tickets have already been purchased.

The smart guide...well it's awesome. They give you a smart phone and while you walk through the tour you can scan the smart phone over the room and visually see what the room would have looked like furnished during that era. Very cool.

I really enjoyed this tour and would highly recommend it."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,Unusual spectacular building,Worth upgrading to jump the queue and save time. An amazing place that had obviously been meticulously designed. It’s quite compact inside so can only take a few at a time. I was in a wheelchair so I had to use a lift between floors. Small lift so a squeeze to get in and not an easy building to negotiate. Worth it though. A spectacular sight.
"September 20, 2019",5.0,this is a must when in Barcelona,"we were really impressed which this attraction, we booked online and i would recommend that as he queues can be long."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,8:30 early entry worth the price,"We bought “Be the First” tickets and enjoyed an hour with a private guide giving us an hour to see the house, attic, and roof unhurried and uncrowded. Thank you Bernat Family for lovingly restoring this Gaudi art piece, and for your educational website where I found a bio on Gaudi."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,Absolutely amazing!!,"Unbelievable, a must do when visiting Barcelona! Go early & book ahead to avoid the crowds that build as the day go on. Absolutely amazing Gaudi architecture!!"
"September 19, 2019",4.0,Stunning,"We bought the blue ticket and walked in with just one party in front of us so queuing was minimal at 4pm on a Tuesday. Always wanted to go inside Casa Batllo and we weren't disappointed. The outside is spectacular, as is the roof terrace which you get to visit too. Getting up close to the dragon skin roof tiles was amazing. Great to see the chimney pot styling on top of the roof too - reminded me of the Casa Mila. Lovely sensuous interiors reminiscent of waves and sea. A beautiful house and the smartguide was informative so well worth sticking with it to find out more about the house. Spent around 1.5 hours here easily. If you like Gaudi, this is a must see."
"September 19, 2019",5.0,Must Do,To understand Gaudi's art you must visit this place. You will be amazed! Buy your tickets in adavance
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Nr 1 Barcelona Masterpiece ; MUST SEE,"Casa Batllo has a presence that is unexplainable. Never have we seen or entered a building with so much detail everywhere around you. Gaudi was a genius and a creative master. This is truly THE best place to visit in Barcelona. Skip Sagrada and spent time here instead. We were the only people on each floor for a few minutes , which made it extra special ! Awesome gift shop too where one can buy world class Gaudi and Casa Batllo souvenirs"
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Wow!,Stumbled by this by accident after eating lunch. Late afternoon with short line. Unbelievable!!!! Ticket includes audio guide which provides narrative and super cool features. Well worth the cost! Don’t miss this....
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Master genius,"Great system here of self driven guidance throughout the house. The visions shown give an already beautiful structure a dynamic interior, living and breathing as you stand in the rooms. Don't rush anything: you will undoubtedly miss something. That was Gaudi"
"September 18, 2019",5.0,interesting fun and a different experience,Gaudi's creativity and thought out plans are at their height in this house. The audioguide is amazing and it is a unique place to see.
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Gaudí - amazing,All of Gaudí work is amazing and so far ahead of his time. This was my second visit and I was again thrilled to see it all. It’s a must see I’m Barcelona.
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Looks like it should have been in Fantasia,Gaudi must have been one of the most creative and forward thinking architects. The house is amazing. I do not envy the construction company that had to build this house! One could spend lots of time in each room just examining all the detail.
"September 18, 2019",5.0,A must see when in Barcelona,This is another one of Gaudi’s masterpieces. It is one think to see it from the street and a whole different experience going inside. Well worth the money to visit. Be sure to plan on 1 to 1.5 hours depending on how busy it is.
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Fascinating building and virtual reality tour,"We've never been to a museum like this! The virtual reality tour was so neat! And the building itself, designed like a dragon, is SO interesting! Highlight of our day in Barcelona."
"September 17, 2019",4.0,Casa Batllo,"We went to visit this beautiful house located in Paseo de Gracia.
La Pedrera or Mila house and Casa Batllo are very close. The en trance is very expensive in both places."
