"December 5, 2022",5.0,"small streets, great charm","A walk in the town, even with no expectation, reveals splendor and charm of venetian buildings and Greek spirit."
"November 24, 2022",4.0,Charming,"Since we did a tour from our ship, the Old Town was combined with several other activities. We had very little time to visit the sites and check out the shops, let along grab something for lunch. From the short time that we spent here, we thought it was very charming. A couple of the shops that I did enter had very good quality clothing. Local touristy shops were there as well. I wish that we could have spent more time here. If we return, we will skip the tours and spend time here or at one of the beautiful beaches in the area."
"November 13, 2022",5.0,Masterpiece,Pure old fashioned beauty It was my 3rd time at this lovely place I love Corfu Local people are so so kind Thank you
"November 7, 2022",5.0,More than meets the eye,"Such a quaint, cobblestoned narrow bunch of alleyways through which to wander and buy all those trinkets, seasonings, and t-shirts that we really, really (yeah, right?) needed to buy before leaving. So, it is charming and every bit a Venetian style plaza with lots of churches, historic buildings, and charm we hoped to find in Corfu.  But look behind the veneer and poke about a bit to discover the ""why"" as to how it is laid out. The Old Town housed the people in Medieval Ages and the 2 fortifications (castles) really do border the two sides of the village and, thus, would have protected it from pirates and Ottomans. To its credit, the Old Town was never conquered by the Ottomans.  Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and its architecture reflects 400 years of Venetian rule. The very narrow Middle Ages lanes are paved with cobblestones which today host a plethora of shops of every ilk.  The two fortresses )old and new) flank the city's waterfront boundaries and it is sometimes called ""Castle City"" because of its two castles (fortresses) and maybe for the tunnels that supposedly run below the streets and connect the ""castles."""
"October 24, 2022",5.0,NICE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE,Travelled to the town of Corfu in the afternoon by private transfer. Very pretty town especially the actual old town which is best seen in the evening when it is lit up with vubrant shops and stalls. We found the people very friendly and the shopkeepers are polite and pay actual attention and interest to you. Goods purchased are wrapped up in a totally professional manner and overall a pretty special shopping experience in an attractive town overshadowed by an imposing castle.
"October 23, 2022",5.0,Delightful Visit,We travelled in on town by the #7 blue bus to the main stop and walked up through the town to the old castle surrounded by lively cafes and shops
"October 17, 2022",5.0,Amazing old town Corfu,"Corfu old town. Super friendly happy place with lots of everything. Restaurants, clothes, nicknacks. Look out for the one off salt & pepper pots. You will know them when you see them. Amazing design. Never seen anywhere else. 15 euros."

"October 3, 2022",2.0,Narrow streets,"Narrow streets and lots of shops in a small area, with some nice larger spaces near the forts. Has very poor drainage as we found out on a day when it rained heavily. The main bus station is quite a walk from drop off points. Its shown as 400m from city centre but is not clearly sign posted. Bus station is a free for all with no queueing system."

"September 17, 2022",5.0,Old town,Got a hire car so we went into corfu town for the day. Just really love the old town lots of shops taverna side street cafes. And getting lost walking around. Stopped and had doughnuts (massive) lol. The old n new fortresses are great. Just love visiting Greek towns.
"September 11, 2022",5.0,Just one of the best locations for everything!,"It is now the 5th time that I've visited Corfu old Town and it is so amazing to see the ancient town and then the lovely rows of tavernas, bars and shops (yes real shops) with clothes that you could wear on the beach or for weddings - it has something for everybody. Each time I treat myself to a new outfit and know that I will have this noticed as being a unique addition to my wardrobe - thank you Corfu!"
"September 3, 2022",5.0,Corfu town tout,"I liked the tour around Corfu town. I didn’t want to rent a car, so this allowed me to see some of the high spots in Corfu at my leisure. The taped presentation on this bus is helpful too."
"August 24, 2022",1.0,A wasted day of holiday,"Awful experience. It was absolutely heaving, walking tours everywhere just crowding the streets up. An army of coaches along the road, eluding to just how crowded it was going to be. The fortress was a nice “ahh that’s cool” moment but the giant queue put us off exploring beyond that.  We had a coffee and got lashed at by a Greek woman who had allegedly reserved the seat by leaving a glass of tap water on it. The service wasn’t particularly friendly but it was nice to escape the hustle and bustle.  We braved the shops, declining fake designer bags, fake football shirts and extortionately priced tourist tat. There wasn’t anything remotely unique- the same stuff was stocked in different shops. You could barely get in and out of the shops, and we frequently got split up by people barging inbetween us.  We tried to grab lunch somewhere but most places were either full or slapped in the middle of the crowds. I certainly don’t want a German tourist’s bum in front of my face whilst I make my way through a moussaka.  We eventually settled on the Europe Cafe. What a mistake that was. Appalling service, with children begging throughout the meal. One pizza was raw, covered in uncooked bacon and chunks of pepper. It was inedible. No one asked if our food was ok, and after a half hour wait, someone finally asked if we wanted to take the uneaten pizza home with us. We explained the issue and there was no apology, no remorse for serving awful food, just attitude. Eventually he came back and asked us to pay, saying we wouldn’t have to pay for the pizza. This was a fair resolution, but it was such hostile service, and we had been very polite up until that point.  Negotiating more beggars, we grabbed some water from a kiosk. Apparently 80cents is complicated change, so we waited ages for that- I think perhaps it’s a ploy to make tourists abandon waiting and to just tell them to keep the change.  It was a run down, money grabbing town and not one I would visit again, or recommend to anyone. The worst day of our holiday and we regret wasting a day going."
"August 15, 2022",5.0,"A walk to remember, but not easy with children","Being overwhelmed by the atmosphere and the beautiful buildings, we were walking around for hours, exploring every path of the old town. the two great fortresses are awesome, but need to be visited in separate days. Also the palace and the garden nearby should definitely be included in the days activities. However, parking may turn out to be difficult as there is parking place at the square but usually with no vacancy. Also, despite the fact that there are spots to rest, walking this many hours with children will prove quite difficult. Many interesting things to see, many little shops, restaurants, gelatarias to visit."
"August 15, 2022",5.0,One of Greek most beautiful old towns,"Corfu Old town much differs from others all over Greece. That's because of almost four centuries of Venetian rule here. Walking its streets you get a feeling being in Italy, not Greece. The town is very nice to explore both day and night. Two fortresses guard it - Old and New, both built by Venetians, between which is a beautiful maze of historic stone streets with many Churches, historic places and of course bars, restaurants and shops."
"August 9, 2022",3.0,Booked Tours,"The group we were with was just half a dozen to start with, but as we arrived in the Town, the group grew much bigger which made it rather difficult for those of us who were at the rear of the group to get the best of the guide. Most of the shops seems to be selling almost the same stuff and the prices were outrageous. In hindsight it would have been better and cheaper to just arrange our own tour and do as we feel rather with a group"
"August 9, 2022",3.0,Nice enough old town - set up for the tourist trade,"We came here on a mini bus late one afternoon - one we'd bought tickets for up in Acharavi. On alighting from the bus the driver made a special point of warning me not to start drinking beer until much later in the evening. Wise advice. Did I look like a rowdie with my son, step daughter and her daughter in tow with me?  Anyway from where we parked we had only a few meters to walk into the extended tourist souvenirs market which they call Corfu Old town. Lots of narrow streets with large cobbled pavement slabs (some quite slippery), loads of kitschy shops, bars, restaurants and anything else to attract the tourists. One thing they didn't seem to have are any toilets. The only ones that I could find were hidden behind the marble statue of Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenberg standing majestically outside the Old Fortress.  We spent a minimal amount of time in the Old Town itself. It was really very busy with tourists. But we did find a lively restaurant squeezed in amongst all the buildings where we enjoyed a nice Italian meal. I steered cleared of the beer... And later that evening, after I had sneaked in a quick pint in a bar close by, we managed to get back to the bus stop at the allotted time for our journey back up to the north of the island."
"August 8, 2022",4.0,Nice oldtimey town,Very nice old town. You can eat and drink some lokal food an good wine. The bus connection is good and you can go explore some nice museums. There's a lot of trash everywhere sadly!
"August 5, 2022",4.0,don't be put off,"if arriving on the shuttle bus from a cruise it can appear dull and run down. Once inside the area one sees a maze of narrow streets, buskers, interesting shops and churches."
"August 1, 2022",2.0,Bored? .... then this is the place for you.,"A large, seemingly completely artificial area, made for tourists to walk around what is effectively not much more than a souvenir market. One or two places of interest but mainly just a place to spend money on tourist tat. If you're bored then this is the place for you."
"July 29, 2022",4.0,Very touristic,"The old town is very touristic and has all types of small shops for tourists, could be cleaner but it's ok to spend some time and walk around."
"July 26, 2022",4.0,Decent day out if you like shopping,"So we caught the Green Bus which took 50 mins from Maraitika/Messongi. Lots of shops, we got lost trying to find old town but eventually had good directions. It was nice but due to feeling so hot and worn out, I was slightly underwhelmed. Worth a visit if the journey there is not too long."
"July 23, 2022",5.0,Great little harbor town,Gréât lovely old town between two forts on the water. Awesome shopping opportunities with little cafes and restaurants . Winding little streets with large flat cobblestones. Swallows fly above. Three lovely churches
"July 22, 2022",4.0,Narrow passage ways and shaded green spaces.,"We walked around the Old Town area of Corfu whilst on a one day stop in the city on a Friday in June. We had walked here from the cruise ship terminal along the coast and although not far (approx. 2km), it can be tiring in the heat. The Old town is an area with lots to see and do and as the name implies, in parts is a labyrinth of narrow streets and passages. For the shopper there are a plethora of small shops selling souvenirs of your visit, we found a shop selling good quality t-shirts at reasonable prices. Moving on towards the coast, there is a lovely park area near to the ‘new’ fortress ‘Enoseas Square’, the trees giving welcome shade from the hot sun and also in the area the visitor will find many cafes and bars to quench their thirst."
"July 20, 2022",4.0,Nice old town,"A nice old town, loaded with tourists shops, bars and restaurants. Very hot in the summer. A good way to break for 3-4 hours a beach/ pool style holiday."
"July 17, 2022",4.0,Well worth a trip but it is HOT,"Some spectacular views from around the town of the islands, boats, harbour etc. Lots of places to eat and drink. Can be very busy with cruise ships now coming back here to visit."
"July 8, 2022",5.0,Absolutely beautiful!,Do not miss this part of Corfu. The narrow little alleys look like Venice and they are full of great little shops. Great for souvernir buying and grabing some food and drinks.
"July 5, 2022",5.0,Old town Corfu sightseeing,"Walking around Old Town Corfu was really nice despite the heat. The shopping was plentiful along with restaurants to eat at. We did find one wood shop that make things out of olive wood that we will return to when we make another trip to Corfu, and that is “Work Shop by Tom”. He makes all the items he sells unlike some of the others that have olive wood items that are not made in Greece. There are a nice park to sit and relax under the shade. Most everything is within walking distance so we did not rent a car."
"July 3, 2022",4.0,Enchanting,"The Old Town of Kerkyra comprises of two parts. The bustling commercial streets in the lower part, full of cafes, restaurants and shops.  Uphill is the residential area: quiet warren of narrow alleyways and stairs everywhere with small churches tucked in little squares. An absolute joy to wander about and soak up the atmosphere."
"June 29, 2022",4.0,Very pretty,"Pretty Corfu Town has an Italianete feel and it's shady back streets are full of bars, eateries and pretty shops. Definitely worth coming day and night to get a feel for the island"
"June 28, 2022",5.0,Old town day trip,"Interesting and pretty, loads to do to fill a day out - easily accessible using local buses. We enjoyed the port, fortress and shopping in the local market and shops"
"June 20, 2022",4.0,Lovely experience,Went into the old town a couple of times. Lovely to walk around and spend a few hours. Didn't eat anywhere this time but will be back.
"June 20, 2022",5.0,Gorgeous,Lovely buildings and views and I especially loved the alleyways. It is such a shame that there are so many meh souvenir shops instead of more interesting and local produce. Will be back!
"June 14, 2022",4.0,Lovely but go early in the day,Lovely streets and compacted walkways. Easy access to the old fortress and museums. Nice restaurants with welcoming staff. 1 negative is that is extremely busy in peak times between 11-3 so would recommend going early
"June 10, 2022",3.0,Quaint Old Town,"This is a very quaint ""old world"" town with twisty turny streets that meander through the back areas of the village. The streets are lined with shops and eateries on both sides. The streets empty out onto the town square which is an open area interspersed with trees and bushes - quite pretty."
"June 3, 2022",5.0,Old Town visit,"We enjoyed the small, narrow streets of the old town. It is full of shops, cafeterias and restaurants. You can wander around and feel the atmosphere as long as you want. There is plenty of shadow so you can hide a little bit from the sun."
"May 30, 2022",4.0,Nice harbour,"Quite a nice Old Town, probably not as nice as say Rhodes Old Town. Lots of atmospheric little alleyways containing an assortment of shops, bars, restaurants, etc."
"May 29, 2022",5.0,A visit and lunch in the Old Town,A great day shopping through the lanes and small streets followed by a great lunch.It’s a very special place!! Prices generally are very reasonable.
"May 16, 2022",5.0,Enjoyed everything,"We drove down to Corfu town from the very top of the island to visit this beautiful town. The town centre is full of small shops, narrow streets to walk and enjoy the atmosphere. Typical souvenirs , bars, small restaurants with tables outside. Amazing!!!"
"May 11, 2022",5.0,Do yourself a favour and book this tour.,"Really good informative ‘foodie’ tour of Corfu old town. Loads of really good tastings and our guide was very knowledgeable. Definitely worth the money. The only downside was trying to park near the old fortress where tour started, absolute nightmare!"
"May 4, 2022",5.0,Plenty to see (and spend your money!),"Our hotel provided a daily weekday ferry trip to the harbour and it’s a nice way to arrive at Corfu Town, passing the Old Fort from the sea. We did have a hire car but parking is a nightmare. The Old Town is a warren of alleys and it becomes easy to lose your sense of direction, but that’s part of the fun! Plenty of cafes and general tourist shops to attract your attention - the leather goods were particularly good value in my opinion. Not sure where the Old Town becomes the New Town but it’s probably around the bus station. These days it’s fortunate everybody has phone apps, as otherwise I’m not sure we’d have found our way back to where our boat was waiting! Overall a really nice place to check out the architecture, people watch and of course spend your holiday money!!"
"December 26, 2021",5.0,"Lovely Old Town,","One stop on our HAL tour of Corfu was in old-town. We were given 45 minutes to wander around (with or without the guide). Roughly two thirds opted to stay with our guide and the rest of us went on our own. Lynda and I left the group and stopped at a nice little café for Cappuccinos. We also stopped at a small bake shop for two baklavas and another pastry. We actually spent over 1.5 hours here, half of it on the bus waiting while our guide looked for 3 missing tour members (2 found our bus and 1 was forever lost). Old town Corfu was declared to be a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2017. We drove past the old fortress across from old town Corfu. I would have loved to visit here but there was not time to do so. Despite having the worst guide ever, we very much enjoyed our short time here!"
"December 4, 2021",5.0,Old town sightseeing,Great place to see. It has a lot to offer. I have a great time there. Everybody who will visit Corfu need s to visit this place.
"November 17, 2021",5.0,"Lovely place to people watch, eat and shop","This is a perfect spot to wander, shop in unique shops (during COVID pricing is very good) and treat yourself to gelato in one of the many sweet shops. Eateries are varied for every taste and again during COVID pricing very reasonable."
"November 7, 2021",4.0,UNESCO World Heritage List,"From the end od 14th until the end of 18th century, the Corfu island was ruled by Venetians. So, expect to see a lot of multi-storied buildings in narrow lanes. In 2007, the old town of Corfu was put on the UNESCO World Heritage List - I truly recommend wandering around the old town."
"October 29, 2021",5.0,Quaint medieval port city,"Our tour for the day was canceled, so we decided to do a walking tour of Corfu, which was great.  The Old Fortress of Corfu stands next to Spianada square and Liston. The entrance to the fortress is available through Spianada, the famous square of Corfu. The Old Fortress of Corfu is one of the most impressive fortifications works I have ever toured. It is built on a peninsula into the sea and connected to the mainland by a narrow bridge. A lighthouse stands on its top and offers a great view of the town and the sea.  This fortress was constructed by the Venetians in the 15th century on the site of a former Byzantine castle. To make it more secure, they made an artificial fosse and thus they separated the fortress from the mainland. This is a great place to walk through.  The narrow streets are beautiful to walk through. You can be in a residential area and with in a few steps be in a bustling area of shop and restaurants."
"October 29, 2021",5.0,Lovely old Town,"what a wonderful Town we had the day here it was splendid. Lots of small restaurants , cafes ,narrow streets and amazing shopping. Very picturesque squares. Visit Liston street and the arches, have a coffee across the pavement go to Spianada Square, visit the old fort and walls. Dont forget to visit Mon repos whilst you are there where Prince Phillip was born"
"October 8, 2021",5.0,Gorgeous Old Section of the City,I spent several hours each day walking the narrow alleys exploring the old town. The modern shops and restaurants are delightful inside original Venetian architecture.
"September 18, 2021",5.0,An experience to remember,"The Old Town of Corfu is a UNESCO is a World Cultural Heritage Monument it, is classified as one most important  fortified city/ports in the Mediterranean.  There is so much to see and do here, the big four main attractions are the old and new Fortress's, Cathedral of Saint Spyridon and the Palace of Saint Michael & Saint George, however there is so much more.  Along the ancient streets and lanes there is always something for visitors to see, statues, monuments, churches, ruins, historic buildings and numerous other landmarks and sights, including  the Jewish Quarter.  As well as the lanes and streets there is also the Spinada (park), with it's monuments and statues to take a stroll around. Not forgetting The Liston, with it's wonderful architecture.  Every type of shop fills the arched acarades along the street.  In need of a break from sightseeing then visit one the many bars, restaurants and cafes.  We did visit the Old Town a number of times during our holiday, found it to be fascinating and steeped in history."
"September 14, 2021",5.0,Picturesque and pedestrianised so lovely for wandering,This is a beautiful old town which covers a large area. Many picturesque squares and alleys. Lots of lovely restaurants with good Greek and other food. Very relaxing as most of it is pedestrianised. Close to the sea. Its the gem of Corfu.
"September 12, 2021",4.0,Town of 2 sides,"Corfu town is pretty throughout the day with plenty of boutique shops, cafes and restaurants. On a night it seems to come to life with bars opening, music and buzzing restaurants. We were staying several miles away but still visited the town 3 times throughout our stay. It’s a shame that there’s quite a lot of graffiti in the town but that aside well worth a visit."
"September 5, 2021",4.0,Lovely,"Lovely to walk through the old town, especially early evening when the lights are fading. Worth a visit."
"September 5, 2021",5.0,Day trip,"We visited here 3 times during our weeks holiday, I would recommend coming in an afternoon when the sun is not so hot. The old town is gorgeous with lots of little narrow streets packed with shops, cafes etc. It feels very clean and safe as you wander around and most shops ask you to wear a mask. Handy tip: if you are in need of some water pop into the supermarket in town where it is less than 20 cents rather than go into a cafe. We used the number 7 bus to get from our hotel to here and it was very straight forward. After looking at the shops we enjoying looking near the sea front at the lovely gardens and old Fort."

"August 28, 2021",5.0,Best day out in Corfu by miles.,"Visited the Old town from Roda Town via a coach to Kassiopi initially then transferred onto the Boat Andreas, the coach part is 15 min and the boat journey to Corfu Old Town was 1 hour.  The boat was clean & tidy, clean separate toilets for men & women and served drinks on board throughout the journey either way.  Once docked we were given a return to the boat time for 14:45 pm and off we trott around the old Town.  The old Town has loads of shops, cafes, Restraunts , you name it, its here, you can get lost for hours visiting endless shops down every side street in Corfu.  All in all well worth a visit, we paid €24 each for the trip and it was worth every penny.  Just make sure your back at the boat for when they tell you to be as we had to leave two people behind who didn't return back to the boat on time."
"August 27, 2021",5.0,Local bus,Used the local bus from my resort st George south to Corfu town at a cost of £5.80 euro...brilliant town full of history and beauty...well worth it.
"August 21, 2021",5.0,Come here - even if on a coach trip from your hotel.,"We were staying an hour away in Agios Georgios, so I wasn’t sure we would bother going to Corfu Town - what a mistake that would have been. We actually went twice!  The first time, we went around 4pm and couldn’t park anywhere near the esplanade. It was packed, and we drove a little further and parked easily at the car park on the junction of Eleftheriou and Lochagou for 5 Euros. We noticed it was only 3 Euros in the daytime. It was only later, when we got back to the car at 9pm and found the car park and all the streets, and every road in and out of Corfu was rammed with traffic, that we realised everyone flocks here for the evening. It made sense why all the coach trips we’d seen were for evening trips - it’s cooler and the evening colours are lovely.  Anyway, the children were tired, so we left and headed back for a second time by day. Wow. It was different again. We still couldn’t park, so this time parked for free on the esplanade near the Corfu Pallas Hotel. We had great views walking in, snd it dropped us right into the Italianate area behind Kapodistriou.  Gorgeous architecture, clean streets, interesting shops (lots of the same - bags, sponges, shoes, soaps - but very nice nonetheless), cafes on sloping streets, ice cream shops. I preferred the day time - it was definitely quieter, and the streets are narrow and cool out of the sun.  So glad we came to Corfu Town."
"August 16, 2021",3.0,Old Town,"Had a few hours to kill whilst we waited for boat to get ready before starting our north Ionian flotilla adventure with sailing holidays, we visited Corfu old town.

"July 13, 2021",5.0,Beautiful,"Old Town of Corfu is a beautiful place and of quite large dimension. Amazing pedestrian streets with lots of balconies and other architectural places of Italian inspiration such as small squares, colonades and churches. In spite of the need for refurbishment and maintenance, the place really deserves to be a UNESCO heritage"
"July 11, 2021",5.0,Not to be missed!,"In common with many Greek Cities, Towns & Villages, Corfu Old Town is the place that all visitors should spend a few hours of their time - drinking/eating in the many & varied local eateries, seeing the wide range of attractions/sites and shopping.  This is something that my wife and myself - currently holidaying in Benitses (nice seaside village/town 11 Kms away) - did yesterday and, having much enjoyed ourselves, we will be back again next week!"
"June 20, 2021",5.0,Corfu Old Town,One of our favourite places. Love wandering around the narrow cobbled alleyways and sampling local food. Hardly anyone there - due to Covid - so treated like VIPs. Food and wine always excellent.
"June 19, 2021",4.0,Expectation Based,"Enjoy it for what it is - it is a tourist trap but take in the narrow streets and lovely eateries that are somewhat overpriced. Take in the atmosphere and enjoy your time here, enjoy a relaxed pace and don't expect to not be in a blitz of tourist type shops."

"October 22, 2020",5.0,A place to get lost in,"I genuinely have fallen in love with Corfu Town! I have now visited Corfu twice and the highlight has always been wandering the Town. The first visit I went to all or most of the places that interested me and the second I went to the English Cemetery (got bitten death) and into some of the churches. For me, the pleasure was finding the back streets and escaping. Far too many English cities and Towns seem not to be lived in and yet here you find yourself immersed in real life. There are some lovely small coffee shops and restaurants up these streets.  I probably would not visit Corfu as an Island before, but I will miss this beautiful Town"

"October 14, 2020",5.0,Just a beautiful place,"Visited Corfu town on a number of occasions and never failed to enjoy the ambience, the hospitality and the warmth of the people there. We will be visiting again next year."
"October 14, 2020",5.0,lovely atmospheric old town with a real buzz,"some nice shops (not just tourist tat) good choice of bars and restaurants, pretty squares and oodles of history. parking can be an issue."
"October 11, 2020",5.0,Pretty,Corfu Town is a beautiful town filled with gift shops for tourists. Some of the shops are very expensive some are cheap. Corfu is a beautiful place to visit also. Lots of restaurants to chose from. A beautiful cafe by the fortress with amazing views something not to miss. Very enjoyable.
"October 9, 2020",4.0,A Must See,"Drove into Corfu Town from our resort, surprised at how much traffic there was in late September and with less travellers due to COVID. Few direction signs, meant we just went with the traffic flow and fortunately came along the harbour road and saw all day parking for a bargain Euro 3 per day. From here about a 5 - 10 minute stroll into the Old Town.  It's just a lovely place to wander around, the Venetian layout with narrow streets, tall buildings and shuttered windows look very attractive and make a great photo opportunity. Sure it's very touristy with the usual array of souvenir shops, bars and restaurants, but most housed in very attractive surroundings.  We just walked in the direction of the Liston Arcade had a drink and watched the world go by, then through the park, a look at the English cricket pitch and over to the Old Fortress. The Old Fortress is an extensive site, offering great views a walk down to the sea and various exhibitions. It's easy to see why this site was chosen to defend the city. Having had our fill of history we then just wandered around the streets of the Old Town until we found a nice looking restaurant and had a good lunch. Back to the car by early evening very satisfied with our day out, will definitely return."
"October 2, 2020",5.0,Surprised how beautiful this town is,Stopped off at Corfu Town for 2 nights after a stay in Agios Gordios. Thrilled that we did. We have fallen in love with this place. Beautiful with lots of restaurants. Can't wait to return
"October 1, 2020",4.0,Nice but...,Very Nice old town. Great place to visit but... dirty streets behind the corner of the tourist center. Sick pigeons all over the town.
"September 29, 2020",5.0,Magical town,"Both me and my wife fell completely in love with Corfu Old Town, it is a truly magical place full of wonderful Greek locals. We came here 4 times in total during a weeks stay and found new things to do each time. Can't wait to come back."
"September 29, 2020",4.0,Nice afternoon out,A lovely place to walk around for a short period of time. Lots of good places to eat. A lot of it is souvenir shops and places to buy fake branded clothes. Still cute to walk around.
"September 29, 2020",5.0,Corfu Town.,Great place for restaurants and shops along it's narrow old streets leading down to the sea. Look out for the small Gyros takeaways for a delicious traditional snack. Some very nice yachts moored in the harbour.
"September 25, 2020",3.0,Not much there,It's something to do but not terribly interesting. It needs a few more plaques for tourists to understand what they are looking for
"September 23, 2020",4.0,Nice old town,Beautiful old town with many small streets and many shops - so delicious ice cream in one of them. I totally recommend the visit.
"September 21, 2020",4.0,Best in the evening,"I visited Corfu town on the 8th September when the temperature was 32 degrees C. I walked around most of the town, had a coffee, lunch and later an ice cream to cool down. Overall, it was quite quiet compared to 5 years ago roughly the same time of year. I spent some time in a few boutique shops including the shop Spell where I bought two designer belts for around 200 euros. I would recommend visiting the town in the evening or during October when it’s cooler."
"September 19, 2020",5.0,Noce place for a walk,"Tons of jewellery stores or where you can buy souvenirs. People are friendly and they will help with everything you need. Also we recomend to eat at local and family business restaurants. Better food, better services and better prices."
"September 18, 2020",5.0,Always lovely,"Always a lovely place, visit the fortress if u can and also the waffle place on the liston. Parking in the centre is 3 euro. Which is reasonable for ll Dy and location"

"September 13, 2020",5.0,Stunning history and views,"Travelled here by boat for an evening (Dimitri J) and spent a wonderful time exploring this stunning Old Town. Must do if you are able and reasonable fit is to climb to the top of the old fort for stunning 360 views of the city, monastery and bay."
"September 10, 2020",5.0,Couldn't be better,"We had an Airbnb right in the heart of the old town. We thought we might cook some, but ended up going out to eat every meal...and still didn't get to all the restaurants we wanted to try. Wonderful place to get up early and have breakfast at an outside table to watch the town open up. Great place to stroll after dark."
"September 5, 2020",5.0,Unique experience,You need to get yourself lost in the winding streets enjoying the perfect setting. You should move away from the very busy main tourist traps and walk in areas were the locals still live. The area behind Antivouniotisa is highly recommended.
"September 2, 2020",4.0,Dilapidated but charming,"We were more than presently surprised by Corfu old town - charming sea views, little old streets, beautiful old villas/appartments, wonderful plazas, old and ""new"" forts, city walls - an absolute must. The old streets are charming and buzzing with bars, cafes and restaurants."
"September 1, 2020",5.0,History & Atmosphere,"... what more do you need?  Perfect place for a wander, where you can explore the past to whatever depth you want."
"August 30, 2020",4.0,Unique place,Been here twice now - once off a cruise the other during pandemic. Both times found the place to be quite busy place and very humid compared to the north coast.  Buildings very unique and from a mixture of cultures  Worth a visit for a few hours and it’s near the airport.
"August 29, 2020",3.0,Nice,"Nice town, but with few interesting points. Nice for a walk in the evening, rich of restaurants and little shops"
"August 22, 2020",5.0,Great walks,"Amazing range of shops and little streets to wonder up and down and get lost in. Well worth a visit, it was a bustling place for late afternoon early evening."
"August 22, 2020",5.0,Something for everyone,"Visited here for a late afternoon (to avoid hottest part of day). The old town has lovely architecture, small streets with a wide variety of shops and restaurants. Also lovely views out to see are various points. You can visit the forts, some the Durrells history etc. And there are more modern shops for those who want some retail therapy."
"August 21, 2020",3.0,It’s ok,"Visited the old town, it’s a very mixed bag of old and new, owners of restaurants pester you to come in and eat and can be intimidating. Lots of homeless people begging. Glad we went but wouldn’t rush back"
"August 21, 2020",5.0,Lovely,Lovely shops friendly people great food simple maps easy to get around. Beautiful scenery to .  Great little clothes shops and friendly gift shops. All social distancing in place and masks in shops everything perfect for a safe friendly shopping experience
"August 21, 2020",5.0,Corfu Town,"Very nice town and full of history ! Went in August and weather was amazing ! Loads of historic buildings and places to visit , it’s definitely worth doing a day trip to Corfu Town if you are staying in a resort outside the town as you can have a very nice day, with loads of places to find for lunch or dinner"
"August 16, 2020",5.0,une balade à Faire,you cannot go To corfou without getting lost in the old village and the market. I recommand you to go there when it s not raining our at the beginning or the end of the day (on sunny days)
"August 15, 2020",4.0,"Lovely to wander through, but should ban cars","The old town of Corfu is a lovely place to wander around, do some shopping for greek products and souvenirs, and sit in the shady street cafes and restaurants. The very small streets and lanes are quite tight and quirky. They should consider stopping cars entering the old town (they did it in Venice, so it's possible to achieve. We couldn't find any of the horse drawn carriages to take a tour of the old town on. Much of the north side of the town is car parking spaces, and the traffic jams around the main gardens make it quite noisy and smelly."
"August 13, 2020",2.0,"Destroyed, mass tourism.","The whole downtown is ruined, there is a canal smell everywhere. Shops offering junk for everywhere for mass tourism."
"August 5, 2020",4.0,Surprise on Small island,"Very nice town!Shops,restaurants,stunning views and much much more. Must do when you are on Corfu for sure. 1 big remark when going by car be very very patienced to find a parking spot🤨"
"August 5, 2020",4.0,Beautiful,"Step back in time in Corfu old town with its meandering back streets of tourist and craft shops and maybe stop for a ice cold ouzo and espresso ( Corfu’s breakfast of champions )and watch this wonderful and picturesque world go by at its unhurried but beautiful pace , simply majestic"
"June 12, 2020",4.0,Lovely Visit to the main capital,"Lovely old town by the sea, old fort is a must see, great shopping experience very picturesque. Old fort is very high up on the hill , quite few steps to climb but well worth it for the view , You can see across the harbour and across the entire old town. Very good historical visit and make sure you got to the very top where there is a Iron cross made up of huge steel beams, can get very busy but still a great site to visit."
"March 25, 2020",5.0,Nice old town - easy to walk,"This is a lovely old town. Countless historic buildings, the whole area is quite compact, so it's very easy to walk and navigate.  Lots of restaurants, shops & more cater to the visitors. Bring some time to find some good products. Besides the usual tourist stuff (I don't mind them, why not) you also can find some real local arts & crafts as well as very good food for fair prices.  The easiest way to get in is coming from the small park ""Spianada"" on the east end of the old town, just beside the old Venetian Fortress. The main drag leading into the old part is the ""Evgeniou Voulgareos"". From there it's fun to stroll around, go left and right and get lost in this beautiful part of Corfu with cobbled streets and lanes. Don't miss out on the Bell Tower, the St.-Spyridon-Church and the Palazzo di San Michele e San Giorgio.  For good, authentic food view with a views head just out of town in the north and visit the ""Veranda Taverna"" for some good little fish and Moussakka.  Lovely town, we'll be back."
"March 10, 2020",5.0,Town of many sights,No matter where you go so many beautiful buildings from past countries who have invaded. So many exciting places to eat in.
"March 9, 2020",5.0,Beautiful town,"What a lovely city, recognised a few durrels filming spots. It's so pretty! We ended up in the middle of their annual marching event. A tradition they have continued since the British had been posted there. So many lovely shops, cobbled streets with cafes and restaurants. Hot during the day and just enchanting through the night. Go at both times of the day!"
"March 3, 2020",5.0,Delight,The UNESCO listed old Corfu Town is a miracle especially during the low season with less tourists and full of students and Corfiots that enjoy their daily obligations. Great place to relax and enjoy local experiences and gastronomy
"February 22, 2020",5.0,Great place to visit,"In 10 days of summer vacation on Corfu, we spend 2 days in Corfu town (Kerkyra) and that was not enough. Walking trough narrow streets and finding places are real adventure. Visited old fortress, old port, Vido island, Serbian House, St.Spiridon church... For me, visiting Kerkyra is best early in the morning when there is no much crowd. Later can be very hot too. It shold be borne in mind that the prices in Kerkyra are slightly more expensive then the rest of island. Great place, we will visit it this Year too..."
"February 11, 2020",4.0,Good in general,"Generally, a good place to spend a couple of hours, but probably not interesting enough to sit around for 2-4 days. A pretty old town, surrounded by beautiful waters of the Mediterranean. Plenty of quality restaurants to choose from and streets to walk through. Would recommend it, although for a shorter stay."
"February 2, 2020",5.0,Beautiful Italianate old Town,Stunning stunning stunning. Could have walked and taken in the sights for 3 times as long sadly had a grumpy 11 year old in tow 😂. Had a gorgeous lunch over looking the cricket Green in what felt like an Italian piazza. Too much to see in one day need to return to check out the other fortress and more delightful side street shops.
"February 1, 2020",4.0,Delightful experience,"The old town is enchanting, narrow streets, old venetian architecture in some parts.A memorial garden to the Durrell brothers, the British family that feel in love with Corfu 1935-39. Whilst some areas are a little run down its not due to neglect on the part of the natives.Greece is still recovering from the economic recession. Lovely shops, cafes and the locals are charming.Well worth a walk around."
"January 25, 2020",4.0,"If looking at Cruise Tours, get one that does Old Town and DO NOT do an Island tour","Spent a day in Corfu, and made the mistake of taking the Island Tour by bus instead of other options. Spent the whole day on the road on narrow streets and though beautiful, didn't see anything worthwhile. Spent a short time in old town by the fortress, and driving through, and it was clear that this would have been a much more enjoyable excursion. Shops, old architecture, water front, great for walking around, etc. Have to say though that from a cruise ship island visit perspective, this was the least favorite stop on the whole cruise and would go to Kotor or Croatia or Sicily vs Corfu if you had the choice."
"January 15, 2020",3.0,Pleasant adventure,"We very much enjoyed the old town,it has lots of interesting stores and architecture . The old town is very clean and easy to get about. We were very shocked how poorly kept were the areas outside of the city core . We found them run down not by age but by lack of effort with messy buildings, municipal neglect of sites and care.  It is indeed way down on the recommendation list to others. With such a history to build upon it is a shame. The fort was interesting but perhaps cutting some weeds would be in order and the squatters in the mote was not expected.  My advise go somewhere else"
"January 9, 2020",3.0,ok,"Nothing too outstanding but not altogether unpleasant; probably wouldn't revisit, though. Just not enough to recommend the place."
"January 6, 2020",5.0,awesome little town,"awesome little town with plenty of restaurants ,museams , tourist shops ,shops coffee shops really enjoyed walking round in very good october weather"
"December 27, 2019",4.0,Venetian Town,"Pretty cool Venetian town with all that entails - nice architecture, narrow and winding streets, an abundance of cafes and bars. It was Christmas day so some of it was pretty well decorated. Lots of partiers, many from Italy, on Christmas night. A little grungier than other similar towns such as Napflio or Budvar."
"December 23, 2019",5.0,Amazing,"We just love this place. The atmosphere in the evening is magical, so many things to see and do. The smells and noises are a joy to the senses."
"December 16, 2019",5.0,Best place a have aver seen,The Best place for walk. Nice and traditional buildings with beautiful colors. I love all of these stores and the decoration. Sea is very close (2 minutes)This place xan calm me with one quick walk.
"December 11, 2019",3.0,Disabled access,"Although Corfu old town is a beautiful place to be in and I will review this later but for now , I want to talk about the problems I had whilst there. I am a motorised scooter user and I’ve never had such problems before. The pavements are to be expected in the old town but when it says dropped curb you do think that you’ve got a way to cross the very very busy roads but yes they are dropped kerbs but the actual road drops even further down than the kerb making it difficult and the only way is to get in between the cars and trucks on the road where everyone drives wherever they want to until you discover a accessible dropped kerb the opposite side of the street. My heart was in my throat trying to avoid the vehicles and they were furiously peeping the horns adding to my anxiety so if you do go to visit this beautiful place do make sure that some one is with you to push you along in a manual wheelchair."
"November 28, 2019",5.0,Week in At the Heart of Old Town,"We stayed in a sunny apartment conveniently located between the port and fortresses and the markets amongst the quaint Venetian styled coloured buildings. We loved the narrow winding streets, the convenience of a small local minimart, seeing the wandering cats who live at peace with dogs and pigeons with the seemingly kindly and animal tolerant humans. So much is in walking distance, people are friendly and the history and culture appealing. Loved it."
"November 24, 2019",5.0,Beautiful old Venetian town,"When in Corfu, a trip to the old town is a must for all visitors. The old, narrow streets are perfect for a relaxed ramble. There are a wonderful, eclectic mix of shops for all tastes. The open spaces are beautiful with the old & new fortresses that dominate the skyline. Take some time to sit at one of the many cafe bars & simply watch the world go by. Old Corfu town is without doubt one of the most beautiful cities in Greece, on par with Nafplio."
"November 20, 2019",5.0,Cruise Stop BEAUTIFUL TOWN,"My favourite port on the itinerary. Did not expect such beautiful views. Walked along the port and followed hsrbour round towards Old fort. Could have walked town for hours more. The Old Fort offered spectacular views. Plenty of souvenir shops selling fresh food, loukoumi and kumquat goodies"
"November 14, 2019",5.0,"neat old town, but touristy","I love the narrow, twisting streets with the old cobblestone roads. The people were incredibly friendly once you got away from the big roads with tourist shops. We enjoyed the people in two of the shops and one of the restaurants very much."
"November 14, 2019",4.0,Charming,Nice place to walk and browse and perhaps get lost in the many small alleys. As usual it is filled with souvenir shops and tourist restaurants. Interestingly there are many locals mingled with the tourists. It is touristy but it also has the flavor of authenticity because at the end of the day it is a neighborhood.
"November 11, 2019",4.0,Relaxing and Memorale Experience.,"I found this to be a very interesting place to spend some time, then go and sit in the gardens outside and take in the view, sit in one of the many cafe's and enjoy a nice drink to round off your visit."
"November 10, 2019",5.0,"A beautiful, memorable place","We visited Corfu as part of our inaugural cruise on the Sky Princess. We booked a tour package which showed us around the island and visited the islands ‘kumquat’ liqueur factory.  On departing the port, it was obvious why this island is such ana attraction. Surprisingly the island was quite green and verdant, with beautiful views after almost every turn. We drove about an hour from the port up to a wonderful viewpoint along a very precarious and windy road. Our bus driver was a local expert, so we arrived safely, the views were spectacular. There were a number of beautiful little inlets/beaches along the way, with the pictures attached.  Overall, it was better than we had expected and we would thoroughly recommend spending some time here. We did visit a few specific establishments, but will review them separately."
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Lovely old town with interesting Churches and lovely shops.,"We have always wanted to visit Corfu. We finally made it in October. We were staying about a 20 minute drive out of town. It was a lovely hotel but on our next trip we will stay in Old Corfu town. We were only there 7 days chilling out so next visit we would love to visit the old fort and some of the old churches. There are some lovely shops which sell many varieties of locally made products like soaps, olive oils, fig products, herbs , liquors etc. There are also some specialist artisan boutique shops one especially nice one is run by a lovely lady who designs and makes ladies linen clothes which were very well priced and difficult to resist. There is also a lovely daily vegetable and fish market there and all the stalls were very temptingly laid out with interesting fish and all manner of local vegetables and salads which looked delicious. We can’t wait to return to Old Corfu Town."
"November 5, 2019",4.0,A warm climate,"Corfu is a Greek island with buildings that tell the story of past empires, come and gone, but what remains is a warm climate, swimming beaches, friendly people and good food. A relaxed tourist destination."
"November 5, 2019",5.0,A day spent in CORFU,😁 Loved Corfu..took the hop on hop off bus to Kanoni Beach m watched jumbo jets land at the airport while eating delicious food beet and espresso. Feet in the ocean and church visit. A must do. Hiked to the top of the fort and to the Yaccht club! Fantastic ocean views
"November 3, 2019",4.0,Cruise embarkment,We visited the old town whilst onboard Marella Discovery. The old town is about a 40 min walk (mostly flat) from the port so is very walkable. Lovely places with cafes and tourist souvenir shops. Would highly recommend if you have the time or are staying in the area.
"November 2, 2019",1.0,Not great Mediterranean Holiday,"We spent three days in Corfu as a hot part of our holiday because the price to fly there was very inexpensive from Scotland. When we arrived their services were simple and reasonable but we noticed that grass was not cut, boulevards were very messy lots of garbage but overall the most disappointing thing is the lack of self-respect to this island. Historic monuments famous castles are unattended everything is in ruin and is very sad to see as well as the food being very poor. The food was ultra-simple with very little care and clearly a tourist City. We understand that it's a popular spot for UK Travellers but as a Canadian this would not be a place I would ever recommend. We've been told by others who travelled there that they had similar experiences and there are other places of course in Greece you could try. Pick somewhere else Corfu is a dud."
"November 1, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Absolutely loved Corfu Old Town. Lots of beautiful but not tacky tourist shops. Excellent choice of restaurants, friendly staff, delicious food. Lost ourselves for a few hours in the beauty of the architecture and history. Definitely recommend a visit."
"October 31, 2019",4.0,Interesting Place to Explore,"There are so many interesting nooks and crannies to explore. It is easy to get turned around. Be sure to stop at one of the lovely cafes and have a local beer or kumquat liquor. If you want to buy some kumquat liquor, Corfu is the easiest place in Greece to find it. There are a wide variety of cute shops and the merchants were very nice."
"October 29, 2019",5.0,Corfu Old Town,"Absolutely wonderful town with a history very different from islands in the Greek Isles. Only spent a day here, but the day was wonderful (took a ""Corfu Walking Tour-Food/Culture). Will be going back and spending several days here. Having had a small taste, we certainly want to explore further."
"October 25, 2019",5.0,A lovely Old Town with some gems.,"A compact manageable old town I love Patounis Soap Factory. The tour is fun and informative. But the real treat is discovering the soap you bought does not wash away your waterproof layers of your skin. And suddenly you have not a flake of dry skin or dandruff. I use it head to toe for shampoo and shaving. Going on 4 years now. I stock up on the green olive oil soap. And house cleaning concentrate flakes and laundry bars for my shirt collars.  There is a new olive oil shop in the old town. It just sells olive oils and some olive products. I think it’s on the same street as Sweet and Spicy Bahar Shop. I forgot the name. It’s the best one I found in Greece yet, because they really know all the best oils and have high polyphenol olive oils for those of us who treat it as a food and medicine. I got treated well and they let me taste the oils before I bought.. the guys were there to help me make good choices. The experience was nothing like that you get when in an airport tourist shop. I can’t wait to go back.  There are some excellent traditional Greek food tavernas . A favorite is Maria’s in the old town. I loved the food.  I love finding a quite street with a good coffee shop and outdoor table and just chilling watching the passerby’s"
"October 24, 2019",5.0,Great Experience,You will love the sights and sounds of this magical old place Lots of restaurants and shops Safe easy walking no hills
"October 22, 2019",3.0,Too many tourist tat shops,I have been spoilt touring the really old streets of Valletta in Malta so felt disappointed when I saw the newer 'old' town of Corfu where every property had been turned into a shop selling 'tourist tat'. You have to look upwards away from the jazzy shop fronts to appreciate the architecure of the old town.
"October 21, 2019",4.0,Look Deep for the Gems,"Looking at the maps, there isn’t a lot of attractions that you would associate with a Dubrovnik or Kotor. The gems are the small shops and laneways. The area is generally well maintained with plenty of variety. Go away from the main streets. Get a fish spa."
"October 20, 2019",5.0,Old Town,"Corfu Old Town and the Old Port are worth a visit for a few hours. Old buildings and churches, lots of little shops and restaurants. Great place for a half or full day visit."
"October 18, 2019",4.0,Beautiful,The history is really interesting a guided tour for an hour will teach you a lot. Tons of little shops selling junk to treasures. The town is well laid out so explore you won't get lost. Try some of the small side streets we found the most interesting and authentic shops are there.
"October 17, 2019",5.0,Great place for shopping and to get a real taste of old Corfu.,Corfu Old Town is loaded with small businesses of every imaginable type. The narrow streets and crowds of locals gives it an interesting atmosphere. You truly get a feel for the Corfu of the past.
"October 17, 2019",5.0,Worth a visit,Drove past here last time did not like the look but was wrong parked the hire car near old town cricket ground 3 euros for the day walked all over old and new shops was great pleanty of shops cafes etc a must took lots of photos of lovely narrow streets to remember this corfu town
"October 16, 2019",4.0,"History and relaxing, shopping and eating.","The old town has it all, so much old buildings, very narrow streets but also the bigger world known shops. We were surprised by the friendly people and we saw a lot of local people who were eating drinking and talking on one of the many terrasses. We did not go inside the fort, there are two forts but the old one is closed for restauration. The vieuw from the outside however is stunning, the Venetian fort sits in the sea and that gives a very beautiful view. Yes old Corfu if you like to find everything in one place surely a place to visit in Corfu."
"October 16, 2019",4.0,Old Town - worth a visit,"We had an afternoon in the old town, Corfu. It is a lovely place to stroll round and look down the lanes and local gift and ice cream shops. Lovely Chaples to pop your head in are dotted around the town. I didn't think the signs for fortresses were clear. The town was very busy."
"October 16, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Prices are not high in markets. Even locals are buying products there. Lovely streets and houses. Crowdy.
"October 15, 2019",4.0,Very interesting if a bit run down,"Enjoyed a wander round the old winding streets. Lots to see. Many restaurants and many with lovely sea views. The prawns in one were delicious. To be honest we didn't see one car that was less than about 10 years old and they were all bashed and fading. The streets are so narrow here is probably no point in a shiny new one anyway! The buildings were in a sad state of maintenance but I guess that's not what it is all about. Many interesting historical buildings, museums and galleries. Well worth a wander about."
"October 14, 2019",4.0,Family,This is in Old Town in a not so secluded area surrounded by small touristy shops.Quite friendly welcome but in spite of sudden influx of about 25 tourists from GATE 1 travel we were looked after very well. The tables were too close together for comfort. Would have loved to have sat outside but we were at risk from the birds swooping crazily everywhere.Overall the food was good but could have been tastier.
"October 14, 2019",5.0,A lovely old town.,"Small and lovely old town. Nice shopping, old courtyards, nice architecture. Recommend both at day and at night. Nice restaurants and bars and Ice Cream places."
"October 13, 2019",3.0,Was surprised by all the graffiti,"Having just come from Rhodes and the walled old town there this was anticlimactic. I was surprised that the old town here was run down and had a LOT of graffiti. Our hotel (tho one of the best in old town, right on the Liston and Spianada Square and the old fortress)...so location was excellent. Unimpressed with the actual town, tho did find several good restaurants and cafes for people watching and enjoying the night air."
"October 13, 2019",5.0,Atmosphere,"Have been visiting Corfu for summer break for a few years now. Corfu Old Town comes alive at night. Great ambience and atmosphere. Sights, Taverna’s and bars with some great shopping."
"October 12, 2019",5.0,Stunning old town and streets,Loved our wee trip to Corfu Town.  Got the public bus into town from our hotel.  Loved walking around the small streets of the old town.  If you are in the island you have to take time out to visit Corfu Town.
"October 11, 2019",3.0,Old town,Well it is the old town. Sadly some places may seem a little run down. You can find a bakery and buy some cheese melt rolls or somthing sweet. Generally not very expensive and find a beer by park or bench out of the way for a snack.If you want a short cut down to the old harbour from the old town try stuck close to the old fort wall
"October 11, 2019",4.0,Lovely Old Town,"Corfu old town reminds me of Dubrovnik old town. It’s full of history with old and new fortresses. It’s listed in UNESCO World Heritage. It was ruled by Venetian and many buildings reflects that. There are many shops, restaurants and cafes. The fact that it’s pedestrian only made it lovely to visit and to wander its many side lanes."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Great old town and I want to go back!,"Corfu old town is simply delightful. It has great character and energy and lots of people . The crowds can be overwhelming on cruise ship days but otherwise it has so many little hidden gems to explore and discover . The food is fantastic almost everywhere you dine , the two old forts are fabulous , and the museums are worth your visit."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Lovely city,"Superb city so much do that we went there twice just wandering round the streets shops etc. Bought pastry snacks from a couple of shops. Also bought cedar wood items, drinks coasters and a bowl. Got other half some ear rings from one of the many jewellery shops. We also visited the old castle. A couple of beers at some of the lovely bars. Bit of people watching. Lots to do here."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,"Easy day, lots to enjoy.","We spent a day here and there was plenty do see and do with lots of shops, tavernas and cafes. We walked all around the sea line to enjoy the views and the breeze and stopped for drinks and lunch as we went. Lovely leisurely day."
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Castle a must visit,Spent a day in the old town. Avoid the days when the cruise ships are in town as it can get very busy
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Better than expected,"Lots of narrow streets in a Venetian style. Little churches, lots of shops and restaurants. A wonderful maze just to wander around with the added benefit of no traffic. Had no idea it was like this - Corfu's best kept secret."
"October 8, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Beautiful old town with lots of character, cute little shops and tavernas. The place is full of character with cobble stones streets, the smells of soaps leather and spices. Plenty of things to see, including two different fortresses and a museum. It has great bus links to other parts of the island. I used green buses which have a depot about 10 mins from the main town or €8 euro in a cab. I got the bus a few times from Sidari to corfu town and it only cost €3.70. there are other little busses in the town too. It does get busy in the new part of town however but the old town is only a few minutes walk."
"October 6, 2019",3.0,Worth a bisot,"Lots of little streets with bars, shops and restaurants and some historic buildings. Definitely worth a look."
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Wonderful Surprise!,"Why have I not heard about the beauty of Corfu Old Town prior to my visit? It was ruled by the Venetians at one time so therefore not surprising that it reminded me of Venice but without the canals. Every turning was an instagram moment!  There are lots of cafes and restaurants to choose from, as well as bars and ice cream parlours. We briefly visited the fort and strolled around the narrow streets but didn't take time to visit the museum which did seem popular. There are a lot of tourist type shops but also designer boutiques as well as an M&S! You can also take a tour in a horse and cart if that's your type of thing (fortunately the horses appeared well cared for). You can also visit the port which is nearby.  Some reviews complain about the smell but this wasn't evident when we visited. All in all a lovely way to spend some time."
"October 3, 2019",4.0,Plenty to see,Walk the streets to soak up the atmospere. Plenty of shops/bars etc to visit / view. Can get busy in the afternoon.
"October 2, 2019",4.0,Quaint. History. Shopping.,There are historical sites amidst the boutique shops and restaurants. We took the time to stop and notice all of them. It was interesting learning the reasoning for the street worth’s in Old Town. Intertwined in the streets are some lovely boutique fashion shops by Greek artists. Take time to go in and browse. You may find something you like. There are lots and lots of trinket shops if that is what you are looking for - not a problem. We were surprised by the beggar children who came up to us and others who wanted money. It was very disconcerting. (Very Oscar Wilde.) - Where are the social service?? The assistance?? FYI - they have a Starbucks for those who go through withdrawal. (I do not.)
"October 2, 2019",5.0,Delightful Day Trip,"We traveled to Corfu Old Town for a day trip on a scooter in late September. The weather was still very warm and being on a scooter it was easy to find free parking. There are a number of one-way road systems so plan before you arrive. Most of the old town is a pedestrian area which is great. In certain areas near the roads/lanes are very narrow. The whole place is filled with all types of shops - tourist paradise. The traders are very friendly and helpful. There are plenty of bars and places to get food. The old town is very busy and fortunately most of the alleyways are sheltered from the direct sun. It was amazing to see how the plaster on the walls had eroded, but the structure remained very sturdy. There are loads of people living in the old town which reminded us of Dubrovnik Old Town. We have a lovely seafood meal at Fishalida. Recommend a visit to the old town, but it can get very busy and hot in summer."
"September 30, 2019",4.0,Nice old town with some nice buildings,"We drove here on a Friday morning and were lucky to find a place to park. The town was extremely busy by 11:00hrs, so we just walked around to see some of the main attractions. The Old Town is picturesque. We spent 3 hours here and then departed as the place was filling up with cruise ship tourists."
"September 30, 2019",4.0,Quaint,Visited corfu old town on a wet day but found the people still welcoming and helpful. It's a lovely walk amongst street cafes and quaint shops selling hand crafted and souvenirs at affordable prices. Would definitely go again on my next corfu trip.
"September 28, 2019",4.0,A trip into the past,"Corfu old town is a must visit, but even if the season is nearly over, the small paths are filled with people. Forget about doing that in one day, you need at least two days just to barely get around. Just so many shops, restaurants and Cafe's. The scenery is impressive, the old colourful buildings are sheer beauty. The local people are nice and very welcoming. Sometimes you come across some contemporary shops which are indeed disturbing the overall Impressions you got from that old Town."
"September 27, 2019",5.0,A must see,"An interesting mix of french, Venetian and even British architecture, this is UNESCO site for a reason. So easy to spend a day ambling around the shops. Would recommend a lazy lunch, afternoon tea from one of the many excellent bakeries, then finish drinking ouzu, watching cricket on a French boulevard. Madness!!"
"September 27, 2019",5.0,Lovely old town,"Great place to visit for a dash of culture and history. Also , if the weather is very hot, the narrow winding streets give you some shade."
"September 26, 2019",5.0,"Attractive, Interesting, and Fairly Peaceful Old Town","The old town of Corfu is attractive and interesting, with many charming or beautiful old buildings and some quite magnificent ones, remnants in part of the island's long rule by the Venetians and then the British before the latter gave it to Greece.  It has walls and two prominent fortresses, parts of the town are in good shape and well maintained but other parts are not spruced up, giving it an authenticity which some overly touristy places lack. There are significant numbers of tourists but not so many that it is overly crowded or overrun with hordes of tour groups and until the very late morning even in June it is very peaceful, quiet, even sleepy. There are many places to eat and shop plus some small museums."
"September 26, 2019",4.0,Cute old town,Lots of quaint narrow streets and shops for everyone. Great place for coffee or lunch. Lots of competition keeps the prices low. Worth a visit.
"September 25, 2019",5.0,A look back at yester-year!,The narrow roads and little cobbled alleyways could easily have been centuries ago - except for the many tourist shops and restaurants!
"September 25, 2019",3.0,Lovely Old town shame about the rubbish,"Corfu Old town is a lovely place to visit be it as a single traveller, couples, families, groups etc. It can get busy and during the summer months very hot. My only gripe was the amount of rubbish. This spoilt my overall rating. I would have given a better rating, however having said this I would visit again as Corfu itself is a nice island to visit and has alot to see and do."
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Gorgeous,"We like to explore the history of places that we visit, so we have a real understanding of their culture, and more! Its very pretty, beware to cobble stone streets, very narrow spaces, wear trainers! There is a lot of shopping, coffee, eateries, very pretty."
"September 22, 2019",2.0,Corfu itself is a very nice island but unfortunately spoilt by rubbish!!,Spent six nights in Corfu and can honestly say its the dirtiest place I have ever been. Rubbish pilled up at the side of the roads everywhere you drive. Even on the beaches you have rubbish sitting there not in bins at all in some places.  The old town is a very nice place to visit for a day are there are some really beautiful spots and beaches but many of them are also quite tacky and spoilt. I would heavily recommend travelling somewhere else in the mediterranean until they have fixed their rubbish problem..
"September 22, 2019",2.0,A Place Well Worth a Visit,"On a recent trip to the old Corfu town I got to see not only the Castle but the town square, the shops, the city walls and it was a delightful day. A lot of good things to see and buy. One major note of caution though, beware of pickpockets. I had my billfold in my front pocket but cell phone in my back pocket and right at the parking area with the mote and the castle my cell phone was stolen. They must have thought it was a wallet. It ruined our visit to the beautiful old Corfu City."
"September 22, 2019",4.0,A Lovely Ancient Town,"Another Old Town with winding streets, most of them pedestrians only, but some are wide enough for motor cycles and delivery vehicles, so watch out for them. There are many shops manned by assistants who have an excellent command of English, as well as cafes and restaurants. We found a nice place for a cold drink down by the bay where our granddaughters were also able to have a swim."
"September 21, 2019",4.0,Old Town Corfu,"Plenty to see and do. Shopping, museums, churches, coffee shops and restaurants. It all here. There's a real feel of Venice without the canals. Very narrow streets with an intriguing rare of shops. Lots of leather and jewellery. Easy to get lost in the narrow streets but you'll soon get your bearings. Liston area great for coffee indoors or out. History everywhere - Old Fort, a range of museums. Worth a visit."
"September 20, 2019",4.0,A must-see while in Corfu,"Consisting mainly of winding streets, many shops and small cafes and restaurants, Corfu Old Town resembles many other city centers that date back to very early times. However, its uniqueness is the array of different cuisines and items to be purchased, all offered by folks with an excellent command of English."
"September 20, 2019",4.0,Corfu Old Town.,Relive history from many years ago when you visit the famous Corfu Old Town. Set up on a hill it is difficult not to miss it.
"September 20, 2019",4.0,Pretty town but full of tourist shops,"Corfu town is worth a visit for a day or two and had a lovely atmosphere and interesting history. Try to get away from the tourist shops and into the quieter streets and restaurants. Eating out can be expensive. One of my favourite experiences was swimming with the locals in a designated, outdoor swimming area in the Old Town Port."
"September 19, 2019",4.0,Old Corfu Town,Awesome town and restaurant. A must for visiting . Shops for gifts and relaxing places to sit and admire the town.
"September 18, 2019",5.0,Breathtaking,"The old town of Kerkyra left us dumbstruck. An atmosphere which is impossible to describe, lovely ancient buildings and the omnipresent view of the sea. Wander in the picturesque streets, have a delishous Greek meal in a family taverna and buy something to remember in one of the little shops full of handmade souvenirs."
"September 18, 2019",2.0,"Sewage , sewage , sewage ...did I mention sewage ?","Next time someone mentions Corfu to me I will instantly remember the smell , a heavy disgusting sewage smell that you could sniff all around the old town . The smell was so strong that it was impossible to taste anything else than poo and warm piss . YUCK . If it wasn’t for the smell the town would be such a great experience since it provides great architecture from so many different eras and worlds . Shops in old town sell crap ( most of them ) and shop owners are rude and mischievous. Would not go back any time soon ."
"September 17, 2019",3.0,Quite smelly,"A nice place to visit, if you can handle the smell. You will notice that some shops place mats over the drains to try and stop the smell . A lot of shops and places to visit. The restaurants look and smell good."
"September 17, 2019",5.0,Just lovely!,"Have visited the old town on the 20th and 24th of August. The urban and port ensemble of Corfu, dominated by its fortresses of Venetian origin, constitutes an architectural example of outstanding universal value in both its authenticity and its integrity. Narrow alleys make you feel that you are in another era. Would definitely suggest to pay a visit."
"September 16, 2019",4.0,Narrow streets are fun to explore,"Nice to walk and explore the narrow streets. Lots of nice shops with locally made jewelry, wood work, etc. On the evening it is buzzing with people. Nice atmosphere."
"September 15, 2019",4.0,A beauty.,Corfu town was incredibly beautiful and we had numerous interesting activitues to do and places to visit. We will totally revisit Corfu. The only negative is that the centre is really crowded during holidays season.
"September 15, 2019",5.0,Lovely vibrant old town,"Visited the old town during our week in Corfu. The old buildings, alleyways and churches are beautiful. Lots of touristy shops and cafes.

"September 15, 2019",5.0,A few days on Corfu,"The old town was charming with many good restaurants. We chose to stay a few days before sailing the Northern Islands out of Corfu. Also spent a night at Paleokastrista beach on the opposite side of island, probably the highlight of the stay"

We would go again but without the car because we couldn't find any parking only after 20-30min of waiting on the side of the road."
"September 13, 2019",5.0,Window Shopping,The old town is quite quaint with narrow streets lined with shops and cafes at every turn. Well worth walking around to see all the crafts and items for sale if you don't get lost in the maize of streets.

There are a lot of restaurants, cafes, bars and shops to choose from and didn’t find it too expensive. We had a walk through the market which had lots of fruit/vegetable and fish stalls. There are two impressive fortress one at each end of the old town."
"September 11, 2019",5.0,Beautiful town,"Corfu Old Town is beautiful and well worth a wander around. It feels a bit shabby and under maintained but that is part of its charm. You can imagine what it would have been like hundreds of years ago. There are lots of little shops selling much the same thing, but you don’t have to buy anything, just mooch about and enjoy the architecture. There are some lovely little cafes and restaurants with varying price ranges. Check prices before you buy anything!"

"September 11, 2019",4.0,Worth a visit,"Like most well preserved old town, the place has developed into a shopping area. Among the narrow streets, there are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops selling Greek souvenirs. The most commonly seen must be olive oil soap. Overall the place seems well managed. The shop displays are well presented, colourful, and attractive. I would recommend spending some time here, exploring the town, even if you are really interested in shopping."
"September 10, 2019",5.0,A place to revisit.,"This World Heritage site is full of surprises, with narrow streets housing small shops catering for locals and tourists. There are some beautiful Greek Orthodox churches. I would recommend a visit to the Old Palace, constructed to house Britain’s Lord High Commissioner, which faces the Esplanade . For Durrell fans- on the Esplanade near the Fort there is a memorial to Lawrence Durrell."
"September 9, 2019",4.0,Super Stroll,"We had a leisurely walk through the narrow streets and alleyways of the Old Town of Corfu.

"September 8, 2019",4.0,Little and nice,"Not the best town of the Greek islands, that is for sure, but Corfu town still has a lot to offer. Walk around and enjoy the view, eat something and then continue your way to the seaside! Not more than 4 hours needed."
"September 7, 2019",4.0,Day out on the island,"We fancied a day out during our stay on the island so we took the local bus from the hotel and got off at the Blue Station near the centre of the old town. Just a short walk and we were right near all the shops; new, old, traditional and boutique. Lots of cafes and bars to enjoy and some very picturesque winding streets and side streets to amble along. Beautiful place."
"September 7, 2019",5.0,Beautiful town,"What a beautiful town! We usually prefer to spend time in the countryside when on holiday, but this was a worthy exception. We arrived on a day trip by boat from Kassiopi, travelling between the Albanian and Corfu coastlines, enjoying stunning views of both, and moored beneath the majestic Old Fort in Corfu Town. The winding streets of the old town are so pretty, their small shops very inviting and the architecture amazing. We took a little train-on-the-road trip for 8 euros each which gave us a feel for the wider area, took us past the old windmill along the bay and provided views of the New Fort. We only had 4 hours, and could have done with longer, but it was enough to give a flavour of this enticing town. We would return."
"September 7, 2019",4.0,Nice old town,Old town Corfu is nice. Narrow streets. Many small typical tourist shops. Old restored buildings with restaurants. Worth the walk around.
"September 7, 2019",4.0,Enjoyable,"We stayed in an apartment in Old Town, and truly enjoyed wandering through the shops, and side streets that were not in the immediate old town. A word of caution- walking is easy with sneakers as the the stone can be quite slippery. The shops may look the similiar with similiar inventory, but vastly different prices."
"September 6, 2019",5.0,Must visit this town,"Visiting corfu town is a must do. Amazing architecture, buildings, churches. A combination of Venetian French English and Greek influences in one town. Just get lost in the lanes and explore the shops. Have a coffee in the Liston area."

"September 1, 2019",2.0,It's a bloody rip off. Go there ones you'll never return.,"Prices higher than in the UK. You can feel it in the air that all the Greeks want is your money, so they won't have to do anything in the rest of the year."

"August 23, 2019",3.0,Fine for a day visit,"Maybe the problem was on me since I expected a lot from a world heritage town but because I visited more beautiful old towns, I found Corfu old town nice but small and no very special features that you cannot find in the old town of the same area"

"August 22, 2019",1.0,Conman car park Liston,It’s only a Euro but really nasty the way it was done. Queue for about 10 mins to get into this car park had the exact 3 Euro’s on my knee for this time so I knew I gave the man in the kiosk the right money and he just smirked at me and said I had to give him another euro as I hadn’t given him enough! Great little racket he has if he pockets an extra euro out of every customer! I had no choice but to give it to him and just said you obviously need it more than me mate! Dark haired man about 30’s smoking a cigar.

"August 20, 2019",5.0,Amazing town,"Took a looong bus ride from kavos to Corfu town (takes about hour and half, cost €4.80) Drops you off just on the edge of the old town. So you can stick to the main streets for boutique shopping or nip down any of the narrow side streets for a real feel of historic Corfu, lots of souvenir shops, leather shops and a curious sweet shop called Hansel and Gretels. Where you can get a wide selection of coated waffle cones, chimney cakes filled with ice cream and topping. Ice cream made before your eyes. We saw the wall boardering the town, the museum at at Michael's Square and the old fort. We didn't go into any of them tho as we didn't have time before we had to head back for the bus. We had a really good day and will definately go back again  A word of warning, to get the bus back to kavos you have to walk quite away from where it drops you off. It's about a 10-15 min walk away from the town to the bus station so keep some of your strength for that. Apart from that...enjoy 😊"

There is the open top bus, a little 'train' and a horse and carriage to help you see more of the town. Very bustling and busy and hot in August. The old fortress is well worth a visit , much bigger than you would expect, but you have to be very safety concious... there are lots of unkept areas. There is a lovely little cafe inside too."
"August 14, 2019",4.0,"Lovely place, but finding it hard to cope with the volume of tourists","Spent a couple of days visiting and enjoyed the sites, attractions, restaurants, shopping and peoples.

"August 12, 2019",3.0,A Greek tragedy,"First time visit to Corfu, and apart from the sunshine and stunning sea views I can't say I'll be hurrying back.

You will find something new for sure."
"August 6, 2019",5.0,Wandering through the alleys,We spent a few afternoons wandering through the old Town. It was a great place to go and the really narrow alleys make a fabulous shade from the heat of the sun. There are lots of shops to browse. The owners are polite and don't hassle you unlike other places around the world. We only had one experience of over paying but it was our fault for not checking the prices before we sat down and ate our ice creams. They were very large portions and tasted fab so there was not a complaint about the place this is why I am not naming it. Make sure you see the price list first. Happy exploring.
"August 6, 2019",5.0,Great day,Lovely day walking around Corfu town beautiful place great shopping loads of places to eat lots of history
"August 6, 2019",5.0,Corfu Town by night,"We did corfu Town by night.. And it was amazing, the old fortress is worth seeing.. The architecture is venetian in style... Beautiful to see. It was lovely walking around all the small winding streets, wandering around the time shops. We even found a Mcdonalds, which is a god send when you have a 8 Yr old.. We watched the sunsetting there a gorgeous picture opportunity. Over all a fantastic place to visit."
"August 5, 2019",5.0,Charm and special attraction,"Charm and special attraction - best description. Old narrow streets, original buildings, taste and smell of the history everywhere."
"August 3, 2019",5.0,Great day out,"We caught the No.7 bus from Gouvia and this brought us right into the old town. A short walk and we were by the fort and then spent a good few hours just wandering around the side streets. Plenty to look at for all ages and the shops had every type of souvenir on offer from copy football shirts, locally made leather sandals and plenty of wood as just a few examples. Highly recommend for a day out."

"July 31, 2019",5.0,Great Old Town,"I spent almost whole day exploring Corfu Old Town and I did not regret. This place is full of life, emanates great atmosphere. Narrow lanes are full of people, souvenir shops and restaurants. Corfu Old Town is place, definitely worth a visit, I had only good memories."
"July 30, 2019",3.0,Nice Stroll,Got the number 7 bus not far from our hotel got the prepaid tickets from the local supermarket...lovely quaint streets and mixture of architecture. The bus stops at the square where all the key sites are within an easy walk
"July 30, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Town,The old town of corfu is amazing. The narrow streets with its restaurants and shops are lovely. A visit is worth it.
"July 27, 2019",4.0,A piece of Italy,"Beautiful old town contained between the old and new fortresses. The Ventetian influence is still very present with stone buildings close to each other and numerous narrow lanes to explore. The magnificent Liston is the heart of the old town but there are also other treasures like the Church of St. Spyridion´s, The Royal palace (Palace of St. Michael & St. George) and the Esplanade (Spianada Square). Pay attention though that the old town is VERY touristy. The part closest to the Liston is crammed with souvenir shops with mostly the same range of things for sale. Don't forget to find your way off the most busy parts and explore also the quiet parts of town like the beautiful Venetian Well for example."
"July 26, 2019",5.0,Very picturesque,"Corfu Old Town is like stepping back in time with it’s wonderful buildings and narrow side streets. Many restaurants, tourists shops, cafes and bars. It has lots of character and is definitely worth a visit. Would definitely return. Highly recommend."
"July 26, 2019",5.0,Perfect,"Just the perfect place to get lost, wander round little alleys, find quaint shops and see something different. There’s always a bar/taverna/restaurant nearby if you need sustenance. We’ve been here many times and it’s still a delight."
"July 25, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place to visit,"Gorgeous town with some lovely tavernas and restaurants. Great place to buy Greek souvenirs & generally see a big boi if Greek culture. Would recommend an evening trip because of the heat, arriving by boat makes it more special."
"July 25, 2019",5.0,Lovely Town,The town has a wonderful atmosphere and you can easily spend hours wondering around and exploring at your own leisure with sights to see and plenty of refreshments and souvenir shops available.
"July 25, 2019",2.0,Underwhelming Island,"I came to Corfu with high expectations and was very disappointed. This is not the island to visit for rest and relaxation!! Driving here is not easy, the streets are VERY busy, road signs aren't clear, and there is no parking anywhere. Im from NYC which is certainly chaotic, but this felt much worse because Greek drivers do what they please with no fear. Corfu itself is only good for 2 things: -Exploring the old town for a day or 2 (after 6:00 in the afternoon when the sun isnt so hot) -Pivoting to nearby places like Paxos (SO beautiful & I recommend to base your stay here**!), Igoumenitsa, and Parga  I feel very sorry for first time visitors to Greece who come to Corfu. This is probably the worst island experience Ive had in Greece and Ive seen a lot of islands."
"July 23, 2019",5.0,What a marvellous town!,"Such a beautiful town, really easy to walk around and loads of shops and restaurants plus places to visit like the Old Fortress. A great base to get the local blue buses or the Green buses for trips to other coastal parts of the Island. Will be definitely going back."
"July 22, 2019",5.0,Interesting,"Lovely atmosphere, lots of little narrow streets with a good range of shops and eating places. Lovely architecture and interesting walks."
"July 21, 2019",5.0,Beautiful architecture,The old town is so beautiful. Amazing bakeries dotted around. Great coffee shops. The old stone paths are so weathered and wonderful. The architecture is so historic and beautiful.
"July 21, 2019",4.0,AMAZING SIGHTS,My wife and I had a short stop off in Corfu whilst on a TUI cruiser and enjoyed the visit. The old town has lots of little narrow streets and shops. There’s loads to see and do. The place is very Greek and is full of amazing sights.
"July 21, 2019",5.0,Good,"I will delete this but my first day in Corfu this summer was amazing going round all the ice cream shops, restaurants and fake clothing shops, but my food was nice and that’s that."
"July 21, 2019",5.0,Loved it,"We loved corfu old town. The historical buildings, the pavement cafes, the open space in the park area, the quirky shops, the views across the sea. Really enjoyed our day here"
"July 20, 2019",4.0,Windy streets,We just love walking around the windy streets and seeing all the architecture. The buildings are beautiful and the shops are fun to visit.
"July 20, 2019",5.0,Loved our stay !,"Before we set of on our holiday, there was much debate on where the best area was to stay. We toyed with the idea of staying in Sidari, Paleokastritsa or Benitses, and we thought of traveling in to Corfu town when we needed to. We eventually decided we preferred the chance to spend our late afternoons / evenings walking the streets of Corfu town before dinner and rather travel out to the beach spots earlier in the morning. We walked A LOT around Corfu town and we found that there weren’t lots of bigger sandy beaches for us to enjoy, or pebbly for that matter. Lots of swimming off piers and tiny pebble beaches. Near the old fortress there are a couple beaches but they are small and often are crowded as everyone is out for the same thing. The one is actually in the old fortress, we entered it from inside, on our trip to the fort one afternoon. You walk under ground almost, someone can direct you at the entrance if you decide you want to see the old fort. We didn’t find Mon repos that great. But the one thing we didn’t get to do is go to Barbati, Dassia and Ipsos beach! They are 15 - 18km outside of Corfu town. But by all the pictures we saw those might be the kind of beaches we’d really like. We didn’t get to see those beaches as we decided to include Albania, Paxos and Antipaxos in our trip as well. There is certainly lots to see in Corfu town, and in hindsight we agreed that staying in Corfu town (instead of other areas like Sidari, Benitses or Paleokastritsa where you may have better beaches near to you) was the best choice for us. We weighed it all up, and only booked a few days in Corfu town before we committed to our whole stay there, just Incase we decided we should have chosen other areas to stay. After our stay in Albania and Paxos, we actually went back and stayed in Corfu town. After visiting Paleokastritsa, we had preferred the idea to stay in Corfu town rather than at Paleo. The church in the Old town is lovely to see. We also ate at Pane e Souvlaki which we REALLY enjoyed!"
"July 19, 2019",5.0,"Dip in the water, great food, fun shopping",We left our money at home- so we explored old town on a show string budget... didn’t disappoint. We went swimming and rock/shell collecting. We dined at a fun little spot. Took incredible photos... IMO. And ended with some insane dessert and Knick knacks. It will be what you make it.
"July 19, 2019",4.0,Good place to wander around,The roads are cobbled and narrow with plenty of shops to window shop and cafes on either side of the road. Just loved the St Spyridon Church and the Jewish synagogue.
"July 18, 2019",1.0,Holliday’s 2019 a failure 🤦🏻‍♂️,"I do not know what happens on this island, but here there is garbage everywhere, and the island is not taken care of, a pity."
"July 16, 2019",5.0,"Large, charming historic tourist magnet","Large, charming historic town brimming with all manner and hundreds of tourist attractions. Every quality level of restaurant. Every kind of tchotchke and knickknack imaginable, coffee, leather goods, fine art, beach wear, etc.. Very pleasant to just walk around for hours. Also this is where the excellent Italian restaurant La Tavola Calda is located. If you can find it you'll enjoy a great meal in a charming atmosphere."
"July 15, 2019",5.0,wonderful place to wander,"Charming, friendly and safe. Wide variety of stalls with friendly helpful people. Look in the small places for the artisans."
"July 13, 2019",5.0,Great place to visit,"Lots of history and lovely streets and squares to explore, easy to lose your bearings, but not too large a place so you can't get lost for long, lots of shops and tavernas tucked away for you to find."
"July 13, 2019",5.0,Corfu town,"Amazing ,beautiful town to visit ,churches museums,cobblestone streets, the Liston very pretty fantastic coffee shops and tavernas.you must pay a visit to Casa Parlante.most unusual guided tour of a house belonging to an aristocratic family.  Very nice way to spend a day.  Or equally visit by night and eat dinner in one of the many tavernas."
"July 12, 2019",5.0,Interesting place with loads to see,"We had a lovely time in Corfu Town, lots of little narrow streets and shops, loads to see and do, lovely food and drink and made us want to go back again and again, which we did."
"July 11, 2019",5.0,Srpska kuca,"Well, I am from Serbia and Corfu means a lot from.us from first world war. Greak people ambrase our week und hungry thouse ds solders and do the best what thsy can. I think we are 'brothers' nations till than.. So, old snd new port, old snd new fortress and city between. With Srpska kuca. That is Corfu for me ...with no intention to minimize all great and more what Corfu has to offer"
"July 11, 2019",2.0,Corfu Town and west Corfu,Corfu has almost stood still in 20 years apart from the prices. It is no longer the wonderful greek island it was. Rubbish builds up by the ton on road sides. Prices build up by the day. The airport is one of the worst in all the islands and all the countries I have been too. This report hurts to say.
"July 9, 2019",5.0,First visit,Have been to corfu several times and never visited..big mistake it is so pretty so full of history and very chilled we window shopped looked at fabulous church and fortress had a lovely meal and sat and watched the world go by parking was a nightmare but we just drive around till we found a space lol will dedicate lately go back to find more little treasures
"July 8, 2019",5.0,Must see,We stayed in Corfu Old Town for a weeklong visit. It was magical. The people were friendly with plenty of shops and restaurants to choose from. The bus system was accessible and easy to use.
"July 8, 2019",5.0,Old down. Nice,"It's a pedestrian area with its charm. Among the terraces of the camps you can find a souvenir shops, grec spice shop and local products. Ghete are also many tavernă with corfiot delicacies and cafes"

"July 7, 2019",5.0,Day trip to Old town,On hot summer day we spent few hours in Corfu old town plenty of shops lots of souvenirs to buy and nice restaurants in a traditional atmosphere
"July 6, 2019",5.0,Hot hot hot!,We always visit the old town when we are on the island. And it's always hot! Best to go in the morning and visit all the pretty little backstreets and other sites so thsat you can have a long leisurely lunch then head back to your pool. We found a fabulous Gluten Free gyros place today but more about that in my other review.
"July 5, 2019",4.0,Exciting,Lots of fabulous shops selling anything you can think of from tourist souvenirs to high end furs and leather goods. Some nice individual craft shops mixed with clothing stores jewellery shops and small pavement cafes. A great experience and a must if you have time to browse.

"July 5, 2019",5.0,Nice town.,"For the first visit, this city has impressed me. Surprising what we visited in Greece. We will back again."
"July 5, 2019",5.0,Georgeous old town,"Have travelled quite a bit and actually Corfu Old town is up there with the best. It competes with Athens for shopping and pricing is great. Restuarants everywhere, little gems around corners, beautiful churches surprise fresh produce shops. Fantastic open areas. Well done Corfu the place is amazing. Monaro"
"July 4, 2019",4.0,Lovely Old Town,If you love walking through narrow streets and browsing local shops then you'll love Corfu Town. Very Greek in a sense that a lot of property is shabby but the smell and feel of the Town is a joy. We tried the red open top tour bus but thought it was a complete waste of time and money to be honest. The Green Bus Station is around a 15 minute walk from M&S in the new town but it's modern and cool and most busies to Corfu resorts go from here
"July 3, 2019",4.0,Wifes birthday holiday,"Town was quaint old and lovely place, in need of some restoration in places but still lovely,lots of great places to eat"
"July 3, 2019",5.0,Great Fun,Corfu town with it's narrow streets full of shops and it's historic buildings makes an excellent day out for the whole family
"July 3, 2019",5.0,veery good preserved old town,"mikst with 2 old castel to visit.narrow streets ,old churches and sinagog minarets.the streets are full of shops,market clean."
"July 2, 2019",4.0,Full of historic interest,"Old Corfu town is a maze of narrow streets with hundreds of small shops selling gold,silver,clothes ,souvenirs and many other items. One of the most interesting wares are the many shops selling all sorts of items made from the local olive trees. Alongside these are many historical buildings linked to Corfus many different rulers of the past.The asiatic exhibition was particularly interesting consisting of many rare and beautiful collections of Chinese and Japanese articles donated to the town by two of its former residents."
"July 2, 2019",5.0,Love the city,"The old city is amazing - narrow streets with shops and restaurants, colorful and aromatic. The tourists are taking pictures, shopping, sitting at the caffe and enjoying fredochino."
"July 2, 2019",5.0,Quaint and lively,You simply must spend a day exploring. The sidewalk cafes and store front mixed in with people watching are quintessential European life. Make time to pop into a few churches.
"July 1, 2019",5.0,Beautiful for wander around,"There's a really great atmosphere around Corfu Old Town which has an abundance of cafés, restaurants, museums and very picturesque areas."
"June 28, 2019",3.0,A bit of a disappointment,"We had been led by friends to believe Corfu Old Town would be a highlight of our trip to Corfu but it ended up being a bit disappointing.  It is an interesting maze of old narrow streets, and you can wander for some time criss-crossing and finding yourself coming across the same junction from different directions.  The disappointment is the range of shops. There are a few higher-quality outlets but it is mostly fairly repetitive tourist souvenir shops. The fun of hunting through the narrow lanes is lost when the same products turn up in shop after shop.  It wasn’t an unpleasant experience, just a let down when compared to some fabulous days on other Greek islands such as Crete.  One tip: we struggled to find a restaurant that attracted us for lunch, only to discover later that there is an area of nice restaurants just outside the shopping area. If you go south out of the shopping district and follow a road that runs parallel with the edge of the big park you will find lots of nice-looking restaurants to choose from. They are only a few minutes’ walk from the shopping area. The road was called Gkyilfordou I think.  Another tip: parking is difficult. The parking at the Old Port was chaotic with cars everywhere - not recommended for nervous drivers or people with a high excess on their hire car insurance! We found that the road outside the Corfu Palace Hotel was a good place to park in the evening but it is a 15 minute walk from there to the centre of Old Town. There were spaces at 7.30pm - by 9.30pm when we returned even that was very busy.  Chris and Julie"
"June 28, 2019",4.0,A few hours in Corfu Town.,"Wanted to return to the town after many years absence, also we wanted to take a small excursion to see the Durrell's house used in recent TV filming. Our TUI rep said she had been asked many times to add this to the itinerary, but nobody interested. Sadly when we got to the harbour there were no trips anywhere, let alone a simple boat trip up the coast to see the house so we abandoned the idea, what a missed opportunity. The beautiful old town is full of small lanes, with plenty of shops cafe's and bars, easy to get lost if you don't have a map, even then the street names don't necessarily match the maps so be aware if you have a bus to catch. Worth the trip but very hot (and this was June) probably better at night after dark."
"June 26, 2019",4.0,"Crowded, bustling and great fun!","What a fun old town to visit. Endless maze of small street with shops, cafes, churches and the occasional square. A delight to lose yourself for an afternoon."
"June 26, 2019",5.0,Absolutely stunning,"Do yourself a favour and visit this insanely beautiful, characteristic island. A lot to offer and ideal for families and beach holiday. Food and drinks very affordable."
"June 25, 2019",5.0,Lovely town,"We had a week here staying in town and loved every minute. So much to see, lovely streets, friendly people and a great vibe, no drunks, layabouts or hustlers so we felt safe and had a great time strolling day and night. Lots going on in the park and so many restaurants. Can’t wait to come back."
"June 25, 2019",5.0,Finally found some original souvenirs to buy,"Stayed just one night in the Arcadion Hotel (great location) before flying out. Old Town is nice to walk around but shops have a lot of the same things that aren’t even made in Greece. Was happy to find two different artists’s shops fairly close to one another. First was Minimis where she makes beautiful, affordable jewelry by recycling bottles. Bought some bracelets to give to friends & beautiful “premier” necklace for me. The other shop I found was Firsthing & Noel. She has wonderful Greek sea paintings that are affordable and other pricier originals. (I spent 15 euros on one & 200 euros on another.) But there are lots of other hand made memories in there. Old Town’s alleyways have some unexpected pleasures!"
"June 24, 2019",4.0,Worth visiting,"Very nice town, definitely worth visiting and wandering through its streets and alleys! We visited it several times during our stay in Corfu...Would recommend visiting it in the afternoon!"
"June 24, 2019",4.0,Well worth a visit,"We arrived by boat from kassiopi, with cosmic tours. We had four hours in town, fair walk into town, but worth it. Plenty to see and do, museums, gardens and a large park to sit in and watch the world go by. The Old town is packed with shops selling usual tat, Also a street with designer outlets. Old fortress worth a visit, great views across port. I is extremely busy, with tour buses and cruise ships off loading, so be prepared."
"June 22, 2019",4.0,Must be visited but nothing unique.,"Not much to do in Corfu. After a brief tour of the city you end up in the old town, with a mixture of a narrow maze of streets (mostly with shops selling tourist gifts) historic buildings, museums and two Venetian Fortresses (one is never enough!) and nice cafes."
"June 21, 2019",5.0,Fabulous old town,"We had a great day in the old town, while visiting on a cruise ship. We got a bus from the port for €1.70 per person. Buses are frequent and the bus stops are easy to find. The old town is nicely compact and easy to walk around. There are two Venetian forts, and many quaint narrow streets with lovely old buildings, gift shops and cafes. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace of the Liston, which is great for people-watching and soaking up the atmosphere of the old town. There is a lovely cathedral, located on a gorgeous square, with many restaurants around. The Faleraki beach area also looked amazing. A must-see area while in Corfu."
"June 19, 2019",4.0,Beautiful little town,"We really enjoyed our visit to Corfu. There are plenty of shops and cafes to enjoy, we even found some unique artisans among the regular tourist offerings. Of course kumquats are the local specialty and you can find them in almost everything from candies to liquors."
"June 18, 2019",5.0,Lovely Old Town of bygone splendour,"The facades of many of the splendid old buildings are in need of renovation and restoration to their former glory. The Greeks obviously lack the funds to do this, because many buildings have been renovated and decorated on the ground floor, so they look fine at street level, but no higher ! Despite this, the Old Town is a lovely place to wander around and enjoy. Unlike many European Old Towns this one is a genuine pedestrian zone - no taxis, no scooters, no delivery vans and no residents' vehicles - just great ! It's busy and vibrant, but not too crowded as there are so many streets and passageways. There are so many lovely little coffee shops, bars and cafes all with outside tables. Most restaurants are in the larger piazzas and some are very good - the Venetian Well is the best Greek restaurant I have ever visited. Then everywhere the little shops - some just sell souvenirs, gifts, etc., but many others are smart boutiques with branded products and the best of Greek clothes. Excellent range of footwear shops, plenty of local leather goods and some interesting delicatessens. Around the Old Town there are many interesting buildings and sites to see - such as, the Old Harbour, the Fort, the food market and the former royal palace. My only complaint was that in the poorer side of town there was some graffiti - this spoils the smart style that pervades the Old Town and the authorities should do more to remove it."
"June 15, 2019",5.0,Very interesting Old Town,"This is our third visit to Corfu and you cannot really visit this island without spending some time wondering the streets of the old town. The shops are lovely with mostly homemade crafts, the olive wood shops are wonderful. The place has a lovely homely atmosphere, people live here and take real pride in their city. We must keep coming back because it is in my mind one of the nicest ""old"" towns in the Mediterranean."
"June 13, 2019",4.0,Interesting and worth visiting,"During our four nights in Corfu we visited the old town on a daily basis. Very interesting! You can scroll here for hours in the small streets and many many shops, restaurants and cafes. if you are staying in Corfu town you will anyway find yourself visiting here."
"June 12, 2019",4.0,Shopping trip and a coffee,"Visited Corfu old town to shop while on holiday in May. If it’s clothing you are looking for you are best sticking to the shopping area leading from the town square, this is where the buses drop off and pick up. The smaller, narrow streets are mainly jewellery and gift shops. It’s lovely to sit and have a coffee and watch the world go round at the Listerns when your done."
"June 11, 2019",3.0,Disappointingly dilapidated,"We stayed in an apartment in the moddle of the Old Town because we love old towns. Unfortunately Corfu Old Town we saw from the rear aspects of our apartment were less Mediterranean Character shabby and more derelict buildings populated only by pigeons, rats wandering up stairways, and a desperate need for investment in renovation. The narrow streets were attractive and clean and the shops colourful though the merchandise was a bit monotonous, We did find a small fish, fruit and vegetable market on two days of our week stay, selling lovely fresh produce to local people as well as beeswax products and other craft curios. Traffic was problematic, on some days scarcely moving, and on all days finding a space in the very large Old Port car park required several circuits and a lot of luck spotting somebody returning to their car. One morning we found a penalty notice on the windscreen; apparently we had parked too close to the bins, impeding their being emptied. There were no advisory notices so unless you know which days this applies it's hard to avoid trouble. We ate at several restaurants and enjoyed the food, though menus were very similar and there was no especially stand out experience. The harbour front is a great viewpoint to watch the spectacular sunset on a clear evening."
"June 11, 2019",3.0,Busy,"Walked to the town from the port, the traffic and pollution were awful and not how we pictured it. The town itself is old and quaint with small shops and different nooks and crannies to walk down but too busy and not that enjoyable unfortunately. It must be heaving in the summer season!"
"June 10, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Historical Scenery All Around,"We came in to the Old Town 3 times during our 10 day stay, each time spending a few hours wandering round the maze of narrow streets. We had visited Venice last year and I was amazed to see just how strongly the Venetian influence can still be seen. The town is packed full of interesting shops, selling the usual tourist-type goods but also plenty of authentic Greek bakeries, food shops and cafes. We noticed the prices in restaurants varied quite a bit so best to check the menus outside first, but most were good value. The People's Garden by the Asian Art Museum gives fantastic views out across the bay."
"June 10, 2019",5.0,Great...,"The corfu is great but the old part is very great place,narrow streets,beautiful shop,delicious foods,you can find every great things there❤️,really recommend."
"June 9, 2019",4.0,Lots to see and do,"After my visit to the Museum I was dropped off in the old town by my excellent taxi where I was happy to walk around and window shop and hang out just people watching, anything you would want is with-in a block, shops, food, a bench and beer or a coffee, the entire place had a certain energy to it and I could have spent hours just walking around but alas my ship cruise ship was calling, you will not be disappointed if you have a few hours to kill, just remember it’s a very busy place and be mindful of scooters and cars"
"June 9, 2019",4.0,Beautiful maze of historic old town.,"An amazing place with a mixture of a narrow maze of streets (mostly with shops selling tourist gifts) historic buildings, museums and two Venetian Fortresses (one is never enough!) and lovely cafes and tavernas. The Liston is beautiful if a little over priced and it can get incredibly busy if cruise ships have disgorged their passengers, but nevertheless a must visit area of Corfu."
"June 9, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Town,Just beautiful the style on Italy but a lot cheaper than going to Italy. The castle is a must great views and for €6 euros an Adult a bargain kids go free.
"June 7, 2019",4.0,Busy!,Visited Corfu town about 25 years ago and thought it was beautiful. We returned last week to show friends around and we’re a little disappointed. The beautiful cricket pitch is almost all taken up by parked cars. The new bus station is a bonus as it’s much easier to find which bus you need. Parts of the old town are much as we remember them and are unique it’s sad to see the whole area unkempt so obvious Greece has no money
"June 4, 2019",4.0,Fantastic.,"Corfu town is a must if visiting the island. Lots of little streets and alleyways to explore.All sorts of shops and there is even an M&S if you cant do without it. Several lovely churches, and plenty places to eat, but the Liston is expensive.. I was there recently for the Independence day parade it is was wonderful. The armed forces, bands, children in national costume. Very colourful parade and worth seeing if in Corfu around 20-22 June."
"June 4, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Greek Island,"Corfu has much to offer. It is a beautiful island with a walkable old town, 2 interesting fortresses with fantastic views, and excellent Greek restaurants."

"May 31, 2019",5.0,Fascinating maze of streets,Having been to Corfu before on several occasions we’ve wandered through the paved streets and loved getting lost in the maze of alleyways and narrow streets. This time we did a walking tour and discovered so much more - from the Jewish quarter (and the only synagogue in Corfu) to the Durrell garden and much in between.
"May 31, 2019",5.0,Maze,"The old town is a maze of old shops, restaurants, hotels and different shades of bougainvillea you can imagine. It's all very beautiful and you can easily lose your way but it's all lovely to see. My top tip is to get in early before the tourists flood the place, Finish off by having a cold drink overlooking the harbour."
"May 30, 2019",4.0,Great place to visit when the Cruise ships aren’t in.,"This is a lovely place to spend a couple of hours wondering around the narrow flagstones streets, as there are so many interesting things to see, and lots of shops and places to eat, and drink. There are cannons by the blue bus center, a statue to Kostas Georgakis, the Greek student who set himself on fire in protesting against the government in Georgakis Square, then move on to the Greek Orthodox church of Saint Spyridon, with its single-nave and red bell tower, which is the tallest in the Ionian Islands. This church is a smaller copy of San Giorgio dei Greci located in Venice, which is no surprise as it was built by the Venetians in 1590, you can even buy and burn a candle here without going inside. Take a stroll down Evgeniou Voulgareos towards the Old Fortress and check out the tall church less bell tower, all that was left of the Church of the Annunziata, known to the locals as the Catholic Church of Lontsiada. Unfortunately, like most of the buildings in Corfu it was damaged during WWII. But instead of being repaired it was torn down in 1953, along with the old municipal theater, Porta Reale, the main gate of the old city, and other pieces of the island’s history, by the industrialist Mayor of Corfu Town, Stamatios Decyls. Do visit the Cathedral of Saint James and Saint Christopher, and the Old Town hall with the white marble bust of Greek poet Lakovos Polylas in front of it. From the shops behind the Old town hall you can stroll up to the arched stone colonnade called the Liston next to the Spianada the largest public square in Greece. This beautiful piece of architecture was constructed by Mathieu de Lesseps during the French occupation of the island, and modeled after the Rue de Rivoli in Paris. Find a seat at one of the many cafes order a coffee or cocktail depending on the time of day, relax and watch the crowds pass by. You might even get lucky and see a cricket match on the Spianada.  TIP If the cruise ships are in avoid the place like the plague, as it will be packed with senior citizens trying to ram everything into their few hours of shore time. Some days there as many as Five cruise ships in at one time. If you are coming from out of town catch the green bus, but do not go to the depot get off in town."
"May 30, 2019",5.0,One of the best experiences on Corfu,"We took our two children with us to explore the old town and it was fantastic, it’s a beautiful place with some great shops and places to eat. The parking is terrible so either get there early or park at the car park near the ferries and walk up (3 euros for the whole day). We ate at an excellent restaurant for lunch called “The Roosters”, traditional Greek food and well priced, about 55 euros for the 4 of us for lunch."
"May 29, 2019",3.0,Bazaar,"We were staying in Kanoni and took the bus, which was cheap and reliable, into town.

"May 27, 2019",5.0,Comfy Corfu,"It felt like home - except it is a Greek island - but it was as friendly as you can imagine and warm and welcoming.  There are many small, narrow alleyways to explore and keep away from the tourists if you want. But the shopping is also interesting. The speciality seems to be cumquats, which are in liqueurs and in dried form.  Lots of the usual soaps and scarves, but also a legal cannabis shop, which surprised me.  If you like life, you will like Corfu Old Town."

We entered by the ""New Fortress"" after a coffee in ""New Fortress Square"". It is a maze of winding little streets full of charming little shops and tavernas or bars, which you can follow up to the Old Fortress area.

"May 22, 2019",3.0,Wanted more,"I had been here 22 years ago so was a little underwhelmed coming back. I mean the town was nice and pleasant to walk about in but I thought it was rather expensive. I get there would be a lot of ""the same"" in the shops, so expected that but it was just overpriced. €90 euros for trainers you can get back home for £40. All the merchandise was pretty much what we could get down where we stayed in kavos only it seemed they smacked an extra 20 - 30% on the price tag.  I wanted to find a fake shop but it seemed the only fakes that were being done was MK bags and ray ban sunglasses. Saw some lovely wee dresses and outfits for the kids but again in not paying €60 euro for a cute wee outfit for a 3 year old.  Plenty of restaurants and places to eat so this was defo a good point, But it was very busy. Everywhere was packed and we had a good walk about trying to look for semi quiet places but had no joy.  The bus from kavos was €4.80 one way and takes about 1.5 hrs.. going up was good as we got to choose our seat so sat at the front (perfect for our travel sickness that we suffer 🤢).. but my word coming back was horrible. The bus station was so busy and was a free for all to get on the bus. A litteral fight to get on the bus. So stuck in the middle of a bus with no air or air con and in mega heat.. well you can guess how much stomach faired. It just made me think of that time in the great escape where ""hilts"" gets sent to the cooler. We were green. Twists and turns, bumps and shuts and all that warm air mixed with BO... oh dear, just let me off and I'll walk back. 🤣  Anyway.. glad we went and tried made the visit but if asked to go again I'd say no thanks and spend my time playing pool and drinking cocktails whilst on firm ground with a breeze in my face. 👌"

And the pleasure is its narrow ,so no vehicle ,you can browse the beautifully decorated shops. If you walk from the Roko square straight to the old town ,you reach a beautiful Esplanade. Look up to the buildings ,you see the french architecture. Corfu is a cosmopolitan city, there is mixture of venetian , British and french culture,and architecture along with Greek one. You needo e whole day or two if you want to browse alo g the shops and do sight seeing. If tired and thirsty,there are innumerable choice of foos and drinkfrom different shady arcades. The church of Agios Spiridonus , who is the patron saint of the isla d is in the middle. The cascade co taining his . Mummified body is in display. Here they believe that he helped them to save from the attack if Turks in 1716. Believers of all age come on special days with candles to kiss the sarcophagus. So much so that the 1st boy born in family is called spiros and if it is a girl she is called spidula. So in corfu there are many spiros and spiridulas . If interested you can visit a archeological museum. Exibits od artefact , dinosaur , some majestic lions. One is as old as 630 BC. May be the 1st sculptured lion in Europe. Esplanade is very vibrant and center of many activity. You visit the old and new fort from there. You can see the old fort from Esplanade and just walk along the arcades there. I have seen many old cities with markets . This one is special one with mixed cultures and friendly shops."

One of the shops had an older woman selling handmade leather jewellry which was unique...leather with mother of pearl and other kinds of embellishments.

"November 29, 2018",5.0,Elegant Venetian architecture mixed with Greek history,"The Old Town of Corfu is beautiful and perfect to wonder around if you don't mind the crowds in summer. There are plenty of narrow little cobblestone streets which are very pleasant to walk and explore the cafes and shops. The architecture is reflective of the Venetian history of the island and at times it feels more Italian than Greek, although perhaps not quite as well kept as Italy. This is sad because it is equally as beautiful if not for the lack of money spent on it. The Old Fortress dominates the entrance to the Old Town and the Liston is an elegant piece of architecture. Fans of the Durrells will surely want to have stroll around the gardens dedicated to the Lawrence and Gerry Durrell. It is just near the Old Fortress. The Old Town is so close to the airport...only 10 minutes drive away. I recommend Bizi Deli in the Old Town for their beautiful chocolates, halva and ice coffees."

"November 11, 2018",4.0,Unesco site,"We loved the old fortress in Corfu Old Town. It is a Unesco site there is a lot of history. I think it goes back to BC. We were very disappointed that it was falling apart in many places and very amateurish repairs has been attempted. I know it is old but surely some money should be made available to help preserve these wonderful old buildings.If it is on Unesco list does it come with any funding. If not, it is a shame. It was very interesting to read all its history. There is a great Bar and Restaurant high up which is great, the view is to die for. Good food and drink also."
"November 9, 2018",4.0,Good walking,"Corfu old town is quite compact with easy to navigate streets and lots of shops of various sorts. The place is immaculately clean, unlike the surrounding area (it appears there was an issue with garbage pickup so piles of plastic garbage bags were left along the roads while we were there). The buildings are well maintained and the streets wider than in most other old towns. There is no need to take a tour of this place, just walk. The wide open area between the old fort and the town was deliberately created so that no civilians would be hurt if the fort was attacked. This has given the place a real charm."

"November 1, 2018",5.0,Lovely place to visit,"If you visit Corfu then its a must visit to the Old Town, it is steeped with history with its fortress and the pretty street with its Venetian influence. Visit the Old and New Fortresses: fascinating not only for their historical relevance, but also for their stunning views over the town, the sea, the Greek mainland and much of Corfu island. Its also worth stating that the jewellery shops are worth a visit and you can get some good bargains from the owners if you in the market for something different."
"October 31, 2018",4.0,A Lovely Place,"I thoroughly enjoyed the time we spend in Old Town and my only wish was that we had allowed more time to explore some of the less-central parts of it.  As has been mentioned by others, it is a great place to find a spot in one of the outdoor cafe's and watch the world (and people) go by. It's also nice to explore the various alleys or side streets, as you never quite know what you'll find. A few folks in our party tried a number of the different food vendors on some of these side streets and raved about it!  We also enjoyed walking along the waterfront, in a nice park, and with great views of the water and the old fort.  The main drawback is the garbage. Although they appear to try to keep it out of the main pedestrian areas, it is piled up everywhere else...all over the island. It is so obvious, and such a distraction, that we had to ask about it and, apparently, they no longer have any place to put it. So, while they're working on a solution, the trash just continues to pile up. It's really a shame as that is now one of the main images most of us have of an otherwise beautiful place."

There are plenty of bars and restaurants dotted around and also a chance to wander through the local residential streets too.  The views over the sea. the fort and castle are all very pleasant."
"October 22, 2018",4.0,Touristy but still a nice place to visit.,The main pedestrian street was a zoo. Several cruise ships in port. Moved to side streets and it was a lot better. All variety's of shopping but a lot of cheap souvenir shops.
"October 20, 2018",5.0,"Gorgeous Town, plenty to see and Do","An absolutely fascinating town. There’s lots of tourist shops, history to soak in and walking to be done."

"October 19, 2018",5.0,Little Venice!,"Loved walking here, enjoying the ambiance, the small churches, cafes, gelaterias, the old synagogue, the Holocaust Memorial, the arched pedestrian passageways....Would love to return!"
"October 18, 2018",5.0,History and architecture,"I love history and architecture so it was the obvious decision to base my stay in Corfu Old Town. I spent three days wandering the labyrinth of alleys and getting lost. You will find every type of souvenir here and all the major attractions are within easy walking distance. I enjoyed shopping here - although the sellers were keen to sell, they weren’t pushy or aggressive. Yes, it is aimed at tourists and visitors, and many places sell the same goods, but look beyoond this at the beautiful history, architecture and facades.  You won’t go hungry here, either - there are many tavernas, restaurants, hole-in-the-wall eateries and gelatarias. The shops stayed open into the evening, when there was quite a vibrant atmosphere.  I loved visiting the Old Town and would love to return."
"October 18, 2018",5.0,An absolutely beautiful place to visit!,"Local cusuine, refreshments, corner shops, & the shopping there is fantastic, i went here at least 3 times during my visit!"
"October 17, 2018",5.0,Lovely quaint town,"Stayed in Corfu town for 5nights and what a delight it is. Small narrow streets, old buildings everywhere and plenty of shops and restaurants dotted throughout. When we were there the Durrell's was also being filmed I. Some side streets also. So many attractions near by in walking distance in and around town Inc old and new ports and forts. Great location for a Corfu holiday stop."
"October 16, 2018",5.0,Fabulously town,"There are no words to describe this small town. It has everything what perfect town should have. Nice architecture, friendly people, awesome food, beautiful views, small cafeterias everywhere. I just fell in love with this city. I will definitely be back. It is perfect for morning breakfast with homemade pastry, enjoying afternoon coffee or just for romantic walk at sunset."
"October 16, 2018",4.0,Pleasant town,Outside of town the garbage piles higher the land fill site now closed! September/October are still busy but not as hot. Dont miss the back street shopping.
"October 16, 2018",5.0,The most happily situated town on such a pretty island,"Loads of history in dozens of narrow graphic streets! Everything smells like an Italian-Greek fusion, even the cuisine! Rich music culture and beautiful corners everywhere you look!!! Would definitely recommend it!"
"October 15, 2018",4.0,End of Season,It's that time of year when the season draws to an end and some of the business start to close. But it's also a great time to walk around this beautiful and historical town without the hussel and bussel of hundreds of fellow tourists.
"October 15, 2018",4.0,Pretty,I’m not saying it’s worth a day trip but if you’ve hired a car or are staying near Sidari it’s worth a look. The rock formations are pretty cool and for those brave / fit enough you can dive in
"October 14, 2018",4.0,History right in front of your very eyes.,"Walked the old town after one of the worst bus rides of my life. (The only one that topped it was the return to my hotel complex!) The shops are a fascinating mix of boutique and large units selling everything you could ever want. Buildings are beautiful and presented with a patina that only the Greeks can pull off. Many look as if they are actually going to fall down in front of you resulting in some stunning street scenes. You will never be stuck for something to eat and drink as restaurants are on every corner. Be careful though because so is crazy traffic that, although making a fine contribution to the ambiance, can be life threatening! Lovely gardens to sit and enjoy the day in relaxing surroundings or get in amongst the tourists and buy souvenirs. You can pay to visit the ancient fortress though we did not, simply because there is so much to see in a day trip. As usual the refuse collectors were on strike so some of the piles of rubbish in the Corfu sun was a little bit ripe. Nevertheless found a small back street bar to enjoy a couple of glasses of Corfu Red beer. Lovely. Oh that bus though!"
"October 14, 2018",5.0,Just wander,So much to see and enjoy. Fascinating architecture and such a dramatic setting. The lovely squares and alleyways make it a joy . Lots of interesting shops and endless spots to eat and enjoy a drink. We loved the Old Fortress and a visit to the Synagogue should teach us all about the dangers of anti semitism. Very clean which is sadly not the case in much of Corfu these days .
"October 11, 2018",5.0,Beautiful place,Visited Corfu Town beginning of Sept 2018 such a beautiful place to go to. Lots of character and charm some beautiful buildings and surroundings. Lots to do from endless shops to restaurants and bars.
"October 10, 2018",4.0,Beautiful,"Full of quaint shops and odd stalls with numerous restaurants, bars and coffee shops this was a very pleasant visit. We just wandered and had a lovely relaxed day."
"October 10, 2018",4.0,Look past the negatives,To say that Corfu Old Town has character is an understatement. Don't just look what's in front and next to you. Look up and see the real Old Town. Find the very narrow alleyways and you'll be away from the tourists. Corfu gets one or more cruise ships almost every day. Hundreds of tourists are then off-loaded and flood the old town. We are tourists as well so who are we to complain? After having stayed in Corfu town we can only conclude that the Greek are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Most speak English which makes things a lot easier. We have also discovered that the ones we have met were very honest. We have not been ripped off once. The negative side of Corfu is the waste - sometimes piled up high on the side of the road -and their excessive use of plastic. Why they don't clear the waste up is beyond us.
"October 10, 2018",3.0,Not at all what I remembered,"I had been to Corfy town in 1966 and in 1996 and returned in 2018, I found the town charming on my previous trips, But the curtrent situation with trash is a nightmare. Large piles of trash with hundred of bags and mattresses line the streets.  And even though it was September, it was so croweded, it was hard to walk around. There were 3 cruise ships in the harbor.  We got terribly lost, as the GPS did not work well in the tight streets, and learned there is no Uber in Corfu and we could not find a cab.  The shops were very disappointing. I was really wanting to buy some beautiful Greek clothes, but nearly everything seemes to be cheap tourist stuff or not Greek.  We enjoyed the hostorical sites and museums.  The best part were the gyros we had for lunch at this little hole in the wall with only 3 tables ourside and no seating inside. The line stretched down the block. I have searched and can't find the name. But you can order your pita gyro small (a snack), Large (lunch) or XLL!  We spent one day in Corfu Town and didn't go back until we went to the airport."
"October 9, 2018",4.0,Amazing!,The old town of Corfu is a step back in time with a multitude of narrow streets filled with shops selling everything from high quality jewellery to souvenir tea towels! The old fort and quayside (where the cruise ships tie up) are within a stones throw of this historic and atmospheric place.
"October 9, 2018",3.0,Too many of the same shops!,"It is a must place to visit, but be aware that every shop is virtually the same! What is so very sad about Corfu, is that it is such a dirty country! The rubbish is everywhere! Why is such a beautiful place allowed to become so filthy with rubbish? What are the people of this beautiful island doing? It's disgusting! CLEAN UP YOUR ISLAND! PLEASE!"
"October 9, 2018",5.0,Lively and colorful!,"Having now traveled a week in Greece I have found the Greeks unbelievably friendly and positive. Even more so in Corfu and the Corfu Old town. I could have wondered days on the narrow streets looking at the endless variety of cloths, shoes, bags, art etc. in various small boutiques. And everywhere you were served politely and smiling. The warmth of the Greeks is something very special."
"October 9, 2018",4.0,Interesting buildings,Interesting old buildings. Roads to narrow for cars so very quiet. Relaxing place to stroll away from the noise of the new town.
"October 8, 2018",5.0,Greek pearl,"Exceeds expectations during our first two days. Friendly, relaxed, beatiful scenery. Romantic old town."
"October 8, 2018",5.0,Aussies in Old Town Corfu,"We had some free time here after our tour and I loved the souvenir shops. I picked up some good quality souvenirs and some great quality, fair priced shirts for my grandson. Good selection of shops and places to eat. We had already had a large traditional Greek lunch but some of the food places looked and smelled sensational. Lovely town and people."
"October 8, 2018",5.0,Must☆,Three days at Corfu island& three times in old town Corfu. Because we had so much to see and feel in those little streets and beautiful squares. So vivid and just easy to enjoy . You can follow map or guide some time but than you stop and breathe with viewing on time and Sun passing through ...
"October 7, 2018",3.0,Rather stay in Kerkyra,"Kerkyra is a lovely city. Greece is blessed with stunning landscapes and beautiful beaches. Although we have no intention to visit Greece again soon. Greece has a severious waste problem with piles of garbage everywhere. This is the first thing you see when you arrive and the last one before you leave. The amount of plastic that is used is horrendous: the harmful plastic straws are placed in almost every drink, three minutes later they are discarded and blown into the sea and swallowed by sea mammals, hurting or killing them. Sadly, there is little environmental sensibility. Nature reserves such as the precious Korrissia Lagoon are run down and scattered with waste. We did a beach walk through plastic while people were sun bathing next to piles of rubbish bags on the beach. The non-adherance to waste management standards should be penalised by tourists but also by the EU as it effects our health and our environment. - There is no low-cost solution insight, incinerators are no option because they harm the environment and hence people, landfills pollute the water and the landscape. The only solution is to turn off the tap of plastic consumption, do proper waste segregation (not in place), re-use and recycle."
"October 7, 2018",3.0,Cruise stop,"This was the first stop on our 2 week trip round the Med on Cunard's Queen Victoria, we were a little surprised at how poor the area looked. Lots of graffiti and very uneven paths, it wouldn't be great for anyone who had issues walking or seeing. There is also rubbish around. It is a lovely place to visit and lots of history, always make sure that for churches that you cover your shoulders."
"October 6, 2018",4.0,Dress modestly if you want to see the best place,"The old town is definitely geared towards the tourist industry, but the variety is better than in most of these places. The usual fridge magnets and T shirts abound, but things like olive wood items, olive soaps, gelataria, local liqueurs, all the way to (probably mass produced) religious icons. Plenty of places to rest and relax with a coffee or beer and watch the world go by. The local Saint Spiridon is a place of veneration for the locals filing past his silver casket (no photos and shorts/flip flops are a bit frowned upon) but the paintings are wonderful."
"October 6, 2018",4.0,lovely old town,lovely town lots of lovely buildings and plenty of places to eat shame about the rubbish everywhere.
"October 5, 2018",5.0,Sunny day,"Reviewed 2 days ago  Corfu Town  This has to be one of the most amazing places I have been to, A must for any visitor to Corfu. We decided to visit Corfu town we caught the green bus from Agios Gordios bout 1hour and half and was dropped off pretty central to everything. We visits the some restaurants for big to eat The big apple. The bus station to get back was a little out of the way but achievable in 20minutes. The coach was fine there and back no problem, The fare was €2.40 each way per person, much cheaper than the €26 each with Tui."
"October 5, 2018",4.0,Vibrant place to visit,"We visited with friends during a recent summer holiday. The Old Town has a buzzing atmosphere with lots of shops, restaurants and cafes. English is widely spoken (good news as our Greek is quite limited). Parking can be a bit of a problem - we drove around for about 20 minutes waiting for a space but are glad we did."
"October 3, 2018",5.0,Corfu Town,This has to be one of the most amazing places I have been to. It would take a week to go up and down the narrow old streets and still miss something. Full of Taverna's and restaurants. Hundreds of shops selling everything. A must for any visitor to Corfu.
"October 3, 2018",4.0,Walking in the rain,"We decided to visit Corfu town on one of the scheduled rainy days. We caught the green bus from Agios Gordios and was dropped off pretty central to everything. There are more shops than you could ever imagine but the wares are very repetitive - lace, tablecloths, wax goods, handmade wooden kitchenware, jewellery, etc. I did purchase a rustic wooden pestle and mortar and I found some Christmas decorations which I was very happy about (I have one for every country I have visited). There is no shortage of places to eat or drink either, literally every few steps in every direction. We went for a wonderful traditional souvlaki lunch then a quaint coffee shop later - both equally delicious. The bus station to get back was a little out of the way but achievable in 10 minutes. It was a mad rush for everyone to get on the bus and once the seats were full no-one else was allowed on. I have no idea how they got back as there wasn’t a bus for another 3 hours!!! The fare was €2.40 each way per person, much cheaper than the €26 each with Tui. A lovely day which the rain didn’t manage to spoil."
"October 2, 2018",5.0,HOLIDAY,"Spent the day in Corfu old town, got the bus from Gouvia and arrived at the town square. There are lots of maps that are in English in and around the old town these are very helpful. Going through the narrow streets in and out of the shops was lovely. The historical sites were breathtaking. Had a lovey meal in the Black cat restaurant down at the port and did a bit of people watching. would recommend a full day in Corfu town."
"October 1, 2018",4.0,Second Visit,"Fell in love with Corfu old town.  Short walk from the new port.  Lots of narrow street, cafes, bars and restaurants.  You can visit the fort and there are 2/3 museums.  Nice and relatively relaxed in late September.  Between the new port and fort there is a lido type place to swim - really enjoyed that 😀"
"September 30, 2018",5.0,"Little gem, historical buildings","Visited here as part of the Sundowner trip organised by RIO. My husband and I wished we had been earlier in our holiday. The old town is beautiful. From the buildings seeping with history to the friendly locals. What a wonderful place. Small warning, you will need to walk with care around the streets as the cobbled streets are quite slippy. Not ideal if you are unsteady on your feet. The streets are adorned with local fare and a small amount of tat. The bakeries are amazing, and a must to taste. We had a couple of hours bit a full day would be better. If you like history, beautiful buildings and a little amount of retail therapy this place is a must."
"September 30, 2018",5.0,Delightful town,"Spent a delightful day wandering around Corfu Town. Loved forts, port, views, buildings, narrow streets. Shopkeepers friendly don't harass.

"September 27, 2018",4.0,The hub of Corfu with lots to see,"Definitely the main part of the Island and not to be missed. The port brings in the crowds from the Cruise ships - always entertaining to watch people be herded around while we do our own thing! Lots of little gift shops and the vendors all seemed relatively pleasant apart from an English woman that kept intercepting me every time I picked things up to look at them, telling me in an grumpy tone that everything was on display – never went back there! The arches near The Liston were lovely to sit and enjoy a coffee watching the world go by and taking shade from the beating sun. Had some good meals in the Tavernas and enjoyed ice creams/ frozen yoghurt / fresh fruit and did SO much walking. Loved the garden where the Durrell brothers' plaques are found and walked down to the port and find great picture and antique shops for some memorable souvenirs. Be sure to look upwards to see the red top of the Church of Saint Spiridon against the clear blue sky. While we don't revere saints (only God) it was lovely to sit for a moment of peaceful reflection and light a candle in memory of loved ones before the crowds poured in."
"September 26, 2018",4.0,very peacefull place,"A beautifull place, filled with small alleys with shops. Nice to get souvenirs or just for a walk or drink."
"September 26, 2018",4.0,Town well visiting,"Was our second holiday in Corfu. Corfu Town is always worth a visit with a good selection of different shops. Even I'm quite happy to wonder about with plenty of cafes, restaurants offering everything from pastries to full meals to break the shopping wandering. We actually went in twice on our 2 week stay 👍👍👍"
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Day out,Loved having a walk round the shops. Being a keen photographer there is plenty to snap. There is a lot of shops selling tat like I love corfy hats and very cheap copy sunglasses but plenty history and lovely old buildings and cobble stones just try to visit when the cruises don't dock.
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Cute old town,Beautiful old town with many shops and restaurants. Worth spending an hour or two browsing. We purchased some olive wood spoons and other accessories. Loved it.
"September 25, 2018",4.0,Venitian architecture,"Winding narrow streets off main road. Lots of individual shops but a lot of China made souvenirs so be aware of what you are buying. No beggars or ""lookee lookee"" men so pretty relaxed nice harbour and historic fortress. Plenty of places to eat drink or people watch sadly McDonald's have crept in. Try the train ride 35 minutes for €8 an adult - takes you round town - bumpy but worth a thought."
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Stunning!,"My son and I spent a day in Corfu town and after having explored the lovely old town with it's many irresistible shops and cafés, decided to take a tour of this unique jewel by horse and cart. The driver was a true Corfiote blessed with knowledge and passion for his city and was kind enough to share this with us. Buy the delicious honey sold by locals for €6 on the side of the streets, take part in some people watching at the Liston and match up scenes from the Durrells (if you're a fan like me) around the town! You'll not be disappointed."
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Lovely oldy worldy,"Didn’t stay here but used the red bus excursions on an evening trip well worth 7euros as everywhere was lit up and looked so pretty, a lovely time to go on a trip as a bit cooler loved all the little alleyways and shops selling local produce, would def go back here."
"September 24, 2018",5.0,Many streets,"Corfu town is a hive of a tivity. There are loads of shops all mixed together. Old shops selling tradional Greek wares and modern shops with the latest trends as well as bars and tavernas and eateries. The streets branch off in every direction. There are no. Arrests here but in the town there is an area that sells are you would expect from a. Resort with all your gifts and beach ware etc.there is a,so a lot of history around the town and you have old buildings, disused buildings and modern buildings all mixed together. A fabulous day out"
"September 23, 2018",5.0,For your eyes only,"If you have followed James Bond and his adventures, you will love Corfu Old Town and the Old Fortress. This is where Mr Bond had a car chase in a 2CV, as I have been told. Apart from that, it is an amazing place to visit. It costs 7 euros to enter. Amazing views, art work and a history of Corfu old town. It is a must visit."
"September 20, 2018",5.0,Lovely place,Excellent holiday here and can’t wait to visit again. Absolutely gorgeous with lots to do and all local 👌🏼
"September 20, 2018",4.0,Shops & Food,"There are many shops & restaurants in old town. Take you time and enjoy, Just outside of the town, enjoy the scenic park. If you have time, visit the castle. The only down side is that traffic around the area is very heavy."
"September 20, 2018",5.0,The CENTER of Corfu!****,"If you don't visit Old Town in Corfu, you must be walking around with blindfolds on! The hippest and most ancient region on the island. Best restaurants, stores, cafes, lodgings, and authentic Greek everything. We stayed in a historic apartment building here for 3 nights and it was MAGIC! Yes, you hear the partiers outside til 3 am, but why did you come to Greece if you didn't want to witness the passion of the Greeks?? Bring lots of Euros because some shops don't take credit cards. Don't haggle in established stores, unless it's about leather goods or gold jewelry. Be kind, and you will be treated like a rockstar.!]"
"September 20, 2018",4.0,Interesting just to wander the streets!,Just wandering the streets of this ancient town is a very enjoyable experience. There are many shops of all types should you wish to purchase a keepsake of your visit or other more sophisticated wares. Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants if you need them.
"September 19, 2018",5.0,Shopaholics paradise,"What a superb are to shop and dine , my expectations were low and I did expect low end tourist shops but was pleasantly surprised to see how many medium to high end jewellers , hand made pottery etc etc .... yes there are some t shirt shops and fridge magnets but not many. It's a proper labyrinth and quite easy to lose sense of direction but everyone is so friendly you soon get back on track , we visited in the evening when it was cooler and will go again in a couple of days. No hesitation in recommending"
"September 19, 2018",5.0,Lovely labyrinth of tiny streets,Corfu Old Town is a lovely place to spend a few hours of a morning followed by lunch in one of the old Tavernas. It gets very hot with all the stone buildings so make sure you visit in the morning.
"September 18, 2018",4.0,Very charming!,"I enjoyed walking around looking at old buildings, doing a bit of shopping and sitting Down to eat or drink or both in this area of Corfu. but it is very confusing.. I had every time a hard time to find my way back to the hotel every day I went to Old Town.There are a few old churches and one synagogue in this area."
"September 18, 2018",5.0,Italian decor,"With a maze of alleyways forming the bulk of the shops and boutiques and the beautiful buildings old Corfu Town is a delightful place,if it gets too hot have a cool beer under the shade, next to the cricket pitch."
"September 18, 2018",4.0,Full of life,"The Old Town is definitely the place to visit in Corfu Town. With easy access to the Old Fortress, narrow streets, Venetian style houses. You can spend a full day wandering around and visiting the Old Fortress. There are many places to have a nice dinner and to grab an ice cream afterwards. From the bay there is a nice view to the yachts and the mainland. During our visit in early September just before the first day of school the town was full of children enjoying their last day of summer vacation."
"September 17, 2018",5.0,Great!,"Wow what a great place to wander the streets and get yourself lost inbetween the little shops, bars and restaurants. We spent the whole day just wandering around and taking in the fantastic views. You can walk for hours just looking in all the shops and chatting to the locals. The cobble streets are packed with loads to do and loads to see. Then stand at the harbour and take in the spectacular views."
"September 16, 2018",5.0,Just get lost in the old town,"Went on day trip on Green bus, some much to see and do, take a stroll through old town, beautiful architecture, walk along sea front, saw amazing yachts apparently belonging to the super rich .

Then walk along the sea front and see the million pound super yachts anchored up just off the shoreline. Lots of bars and eateries and a huge amount of market type stalls selling everything from art work to local carvings from Olive wood. Stunning place though can get very busy in the height of the season."
"September 14, 2018",5.0,Worth the visit,"Historic part of the town, very well preserved and plenty of available information regarding the area dating back to Venetian times. Plenty of places to eat and drink and relax. Good shopping as well."

"September 7, 2018",3.0,Check for disruption,Lovely place to while a way a couple of hours. We took blue bus in from our resort. Once during the day with no problems but on the second visit after a superb evening we tried to catch the bus back to our resort only to be told the roads had been closed due to industrial action. We were stranded. Luckily we met another couple from our resort. We managed to persuade a very nice taxi driver to take as as far as he could so we could walk the rest of the way. Very stressful to be stranded many miles from accommodation and no information and limited common language.  Just posting to advise people to check for any industrial action. At the moment it is apparently common for this type of incident as there is an on-going dispute to do with refuse...which is also meaning there is rubbish piling up.
"September 7, 2018",5.0,The Rex restaurant,"Corfu.  A nice historic restaurant in the Old Town.  Great presentation of the dishes served. All the meals we ordered were delicious but the pastitsada, which is a Corfiot dish, was the best. We loved it so much we went back for a second night.  Prices were reasonable for Greek modern cuisine. The waiters were very helpful with ordering the meals. We preferred to sit inside which was airconditioned, a nice relief from the warm weather. Highly recommend this restaurant."
"September 6, 2018",5.0,Old meets new,A beautiful town with charming narrow streets and cobbled pavements. Many small touristy shops but also well known chains mixed in with them. Extremely busy on the day we visited as 6 cruise ships in port but we still found it easy to find a seat in one of the many cafes. Great to sit and watch the world go by. If you visit Corfu then you need to visit the old town to get a flavour of how things used to be.
"September 5, 2018",4.0,Nice walk,"Visited several times early in September- since we were driving liked good parking, narrow shady streets are a good retreat from heat. A lot of bars and restaurants, souvenirs shops. Thought buildings are not very well kept, the atmosphere is nice and easy."
"September 5, 2018",4.0,Bustling town,"We spent a morning here and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like trinket shops, jewellery, leather, eating and drinking this is the place for you. Looking for gifts, you’ll find something. I loved the fact that very few people hassle you when you are browsing. They may come and chat but you don’t feel you have to buy. For those who like to feel at home...there is a McDonalds (didn’t go there, but if you need the loo you know there will be one there)! A really lovely old town that was incredibly clean considering how many people were there."
"September 5, 2018",4.0,Beautiful but hectic,"Only visited for a few hours, got lost on its shopping streets and enjoyed a good meal. The town has quite a hectic traffic, stop lights that aren't working properly and parking spaces that are scarce. Definetly recommended for people that love sightseeing and dont mind crowded places."
"September 5, 2018",5.0,Our favourite port of call on our cruise,Corfu was one of our stops on a cruise ship tour. We absolutely loved this Old Town with its charming streets and shops.
"September 4, 2018",5.0,Corfu Town is a Beautiful Surprise,"Despite all the knick-knack shops and chains, we fell in love with Corfu Town. It is a very elegant place with many beautiful houses (many unrestored and falling apart), lots of good eateries and cafes, friendly locals, helpful shopkeepers (not kidding: there is no pulling you into shops or making you feel bad if you don't buy something) and a generally very relaxed atmosphere. I love Jerez (the food, the sherry, the palaces!) and Corfu is in the same league."

"September 2, 2018",4.0,Cobbled stone streets and a throw back of time gone by,Great to visit easy to walk through and lots of small bars and shops to keep your interest . Church bells and cafes make it a great stop. Park out side the town and walk in or get a cab.
"September 1, 2018",5.0,A day in Corfu old Town,We have just had a lovely day walking around the old town quaint little side streets lovely restaurants and a walk around the old fort If your staying on another part of the island it’s definitely worth visiting
"August 30, 2018",5.0,A throw back to old Italy,Beautiful town which resembles the old and marrow streets of Venice in many places. A lot of variety in terms of shopping and eateries amongst other things. On a 11 day holiday we visited 4 times and the kids enjoyed every visit.
"August 27, 2018",5.0,quite spectacular!,"I will admit that I was not expecting Corfu to be so cultural, historical, foodie or vibrant. its got all the Greek island charm with a unique depth!  we spent 2 weeks and there was so much to do. sun sea sand food wine culture and prices to suit high and low budgets. my teenage boys loved it."
"August 27, 2018",4.0,Lovely old town,Lots of shops and bars and restaurants and people. The cobbled streets are the norm so wear comfortable shoes.
"August 26, 2018",4.0,It's in Corfu. It's a town. Looks old,"Wander the tiny streets, lose yourself in the myriad jewelery and leather bag stores and bide your time as your children obsess about the fact they seem to sell Fortnite tshirts in every shop.  It's lovely and it's quaint. But you've been to places like this before, this one's more Venetian in architecture than most  Arrive by boat, as my Greek friend described it as ""the parking is Greek"" (in a good way!)  We visited the Money history museum. Its interesting to see the varied history of Ionian islands through the lens of their cash. Alot to find here that you may not know about the sovereignty of the region.  Good. Worth a few hours. Then back on the boat for snorkeling in deserted bays as you await your next installment of fresh fish of Mythos!"
"August 25, 2018",5.0,Lovely old town,Love the cobbled streets filled with shops bars and restaurants. Bustling with families. Trues different restaurants and bars whilst here and everyone was very friendly.
"August 24, 2018",5.0,Loved it,"What a great place. Loved the narrow cobbled streets with all the different shops. Lots to look at including jewellery, bags, leather goods, lace and wooden ornaments. Plenty of cafes and coffee shops. One downside I found is some of the cobbles are very slippery. Apart from that, loved it. Could have spent more time there."
"August 24, 2018",3.0,Busy and vibrant but too many hawkers,"The old town is great and it is a series of old streets that interlink with each other with markets shops and restaurants everywhere.  Everyone wants a piece of you, and if you sit down at any of the bars or restaurants then you will get serenaded by bands, musicians or street sellers (and beggars sometimes as well) all looking for a donation. They don’t get ratty if you don’t, but do not engage, pick up, or take a photo of them, unless you want to be a few euros lighter!  Wander, shop, drink and eat."
"August 23, 2018",5.0,You must go there!!!,"We visited Corfu town many times during our stay in the island. It is very picturesque, the Liston square, the narrow roads, the shops, it is a very alive place. There are many bars and restaurants of high quality (not all) and we loved the local bands who played in the square! It was amazing as we stepped on two different bands during our stay and we listened to very nice music! We highly recommend it for everybody!"
"August 23, 2018",5.0,Fabulous architecture- well worth a visit,"A must-see on Corfu- its like Venice, but without the canals. Have a coffee on the Liston and watch people. Go into the back lanes and check out all the shops."
"August 23, 2018",5.0,"Amazing town, well worth a visit!","Travelled to the Old Town by bus from Ipsos, took around 45 minutes. Loved the cobbled streets with loads of unique, quirky shops. One of my favourite places to visit."
