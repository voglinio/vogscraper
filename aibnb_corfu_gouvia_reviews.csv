17869884,Parsla October 2022 We had a great stay. Appartment was very clean and cosy with a couple of cute cats garding it and welcoming each guest. Kitchen is quite small so I would say the apartment is perfect for short stays and those who mostly eat outside. Communication was great both before and during our stay. We got all the instructions and recommendations. Everything is located in close proximity. Hosts took good care of us and even gave us some delicious fruits from their garden. Thank you very much for your hospitality!
17869884,Polly September 2022 We had an amazing stay in the Yellow room! Felt very relaxed there and with a lovely outside space. One night we cooked a meal in the bbq and ate it under the olive tree outside which was lovely. Cute kittens and a dog roaming around outside which made it feel homely. Host is so friendly and helpful  answered our questions when we had them! very easy to get a hold of and gave us great recommendations for places to eat and drink in Corfu town. Would love to return one day.

17869884,Francesco September 2022 Where to start‚Ä¶a beautiful location  with beautiful energy  where you can feel yourself at home the very moment you step in! The most peculiar thing is the kindness of the host  who always finds a way to take care of your needs  filling you with attention during all the staying  really incomparable to others! Demetra and Nicholas make you feel part of their family and allow you to live the island in its essence!!! The house is near Corfu town and very central and connected. The studio was very clean  with all the comforts and gadgets you need  including a wonderful kitchen and books to read. It included a parking spot for our scooter. In our opinion the best choice we could do! See you soon Demetra and Nicholas :)
17869884,Francesco August 2022 This house is really clean and fantastic for the position (it is near to the bus stop for buses to Corf√π town and for the other beaches of the island). Demetra was always avaible and she took care of us during all the stay. This house is absolutely recommended.
17869884,Chiara August 2022 Small but functional accommodation  complete with everything you need  perfect for two people. Very very quiet place and the host Demetra is super helpful! We had a great time

624634481609085660,Michael July 2022 I cannot recommend enough this beautiful cottage! Elina was incredibly generous and responsive throughout and welcoming for my first trip to Corfu. The home‚Äôs location is ideal for exploring the island (a rental car is highly recommended  if not a must). It‚Äôs right if the main road between Corfu Town and Palaiokastritsa. The stone house has everything one could ask for in a vacation property. The only thing missing is faster wi-fi (there is a small dongle with very slow Internet). Really I cannot say enough good things about this property and Elina! 5 stars!

The house is perfect for 1-2 people. The terrace and garden are great. You can look directly at the mountains. Very modernly furnished and it has everything you need. Very stylish  and cuddly decorated. I felt very comfortable.  It is about 20-30 minutes on foot to the beach  about 6 minutes by car and about 5-10 minutes by e-bike.  Corfu is great and the accommodation and Elina make the stay perfect. Thank you for everything Translated from German  Show original
