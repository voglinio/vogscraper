January,20,2023,5.0,Amazing! But go EARLY!,Visiting the Acropolis is a MUST if you visit Athens. My best advice is go early; it is far less crowded first thing in the morning. The walk up (the longer way) is easy  and it affords the opportunity to see several other sites located along the perimeter. The first view of the actual acropolis itself if breathtaking. Once you get ot the top  on a clear day  you can see all the way to the coast. It's a bit disconcerting to see the modern day cranes sitting in the middle of the ruins  but the ongoing renovations are necessary. (And apparently have been ongong for decades.) Take your time walking around. There is much to see. We arrived when it opened  and when we were ready to leave it was starting to get crowded. It is absolutely amazing that this site has been so well preserved. Wow. Just wow.
January,17,2023,5.0,Magnificent,Amazing place full of history. It really blows you away when you first walk up the steps of the entrance. On a busy day I would suggest just booking the tickets online in advance but in December the lines weren’t that long.
January,16,2023,5.0,Free Rick Steves Audio Tour for Acropolis,"As I mentioned in my Parthenon review  I wish that I had a tour guide during our trip.  Just now  I found a free audio tour guide from Rick Steve.  You need to download ""Rick Steves Audio Europe""   then go to ""Find Tours & Interviews"". From here  you can choose ""Greece"".  From this submenu  you can find many audio tours: Athens Acropolis  Athens Ancient Agora  Athens City Walk  etc.  It is very easy  cheap & informative. Enjoy..."
January,13,2023,5.0,A must see,Obviously a must see in Athens. A climb that’s definitely worth it. Loved our less busy visit in the winter season. Don’t forget the sunscreen!
January,9,2023,5.0,Acropolis - simply breathtaking,I am from Greece and I had only visited Acropolis once  but never walked the whole hill up to Parthenon. I am shocked how we do not appreciate what we have and take it for granted. I have visited many archaeological sites around the world  but Acropolis is breathtaking. You can feel the glory of the size of the whole hill and all the ancient structures built on it as well as the spotless architecture of the monuments. It's honestly a must visit.
January,9,2023,5.0,Site to be seen!,The history and magnificent size of it is such an architectural feat. You feel so small when you are next to it. We found it incredible and a must do when in Athens.
January,8,2023,5.0,VISIT AT LEAST ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME.,Hopefully it will look much better very soon after the stolen marbles -taken down by lord Elgin- return from the British Museum. Missing since 19th century and the Greek people are waiting. Now is the time!!! Greece will then celebrate and so will the whole world. Please join this latest movement.
January,7,2023,5.0,Go early and be prepared for astounding views,It's worth getting up early to visit the Acropolis and its temples. Book tickets online before you go. If you do arrive later and there's a queue  walk a little way up the hill to some steps to get to the rear gate (which is near the main entrance of the Parthenon) as it can be quieter. Many of the paths are marble and uneven so I recommend wearing comfortable shoes with grip. This is not the place for slippy sandals or anything with a heel! Only water is allowed - no other drinks or food. Don't expect the site to be pristine. The Acropolis is an active archaeological site.
January,3,2023,5.0,"MUST SEE, NOT to be MISSED. It is THE Site to see in Athens. TIPS",MUST SEE NOT to be MISSED. It is THE Site to see in Athens. Get a guided tour so you know what you’re seeing. Learned a great deal of history and really enjoyed our tour.  TIPS: wear good walking shoes  would not recommend for people with walking issues because of all the marble steps which can be slippery. Winter - can be rainy and very windy up top. Summer - scorching melt your plastic shoes hot. Most tours are 2hrs long OUTSIDE so there is no shade or respite and steep incline climb. Don’t bring a backpack as it’ll weigh you down and you can’t take it into the Acropolis museum anyways. Buy tickets online beforehand especially in the summer because you do not want to be standing in a long ticket line in the heat  then in a long entry line. Start at the southern end of the Acropolis.
January,2,2023,5.0,Another of the bucket list.,Was as more impressive close up as any photo can convey . Being with a trained guide is a must or you would miss a lot of the features. Just a fantastic experience.
December,31,2022,5.0,Beautiful,Beautiful and well maintained. Definitely a place like none other. Make sure that you wear comfy clothes and shoes  as it is a good walk to the top of the hill. Wonderful views of the city. Great place to visit and take in the beautiful ancient views.
December,31,2022,5.0,History made palpable,What a historical site ... No matter how many pictures one may have seen of the Acropolis on TV or elsewhere  walking up the hill and through the ancient buildings in person is something completely different. I'd definitely recommend taking the walk from the Acropolis museum to the top and take an audio guide (or a personal guide) along. We had an audio guide from ClioMuse with the Get your Guide entrance ticket  which didn't only give the technical info but also provided interesting stories ...
December,31,2022,5.0,Walk about for a few hours.,Had a very educational visit without a walking tour or guide. No lines if you go early in the morning.
December,28,2022,5.0,One of the most recognized sites in the world,The acropolis of Athens  including the Parthenon  Odeon and other buildings is one of the most recognized sites in the world...and with good reason. This sprawling site is a massive  living museum to all that we know as western civilization. A trip to Athens without a visit to the Acropolis should be illegal  but at a minimum it would be foolish. Doesn't matter how many times you've been  you'll always find something new to study  view or enjoy.
December,27,2022,5.0,Can’t be missed,Probably the main reason why most tourists come to Athens. It doesn’t disappoint and the views of the city are terrific. I visited around 9:30 on a December morning and couldn’t help but notice the crowds flocking go the place as I was leaving. I would recommend visiting in the winter months and in the morning if you want to miss massive crowds
December,12,2022,5.0,Cradle of Western civilization,If you are interested in Western culture  you can't stand here and feel nothing. This is the heart of ancient Athenian civilization and it shows
December,11,2022,5.0,A must see in Athens,If you are in Athens the Acropolis is a must see. We spent more than an hour walking around the site  reading the information and enjoying the views. There is a lot of restoration going on  but it doesn't spoil the visit. We bought the combined ticket to give us access to more sites over 5 days
December,4,2022,5.0,Historical place- a must !,It was so wonderful to visit this historical  mythological place !!! I got there using the subway from downtown Athens. it offered a beautiful view of Athens. So happy that i had the chance to see Greece  which was in my bucket list.
December,3,2022,3.0,always under construction and crowded,hard to appreciate this site with so many people crowding and all the scaffolding around it. I wouldn't bother visiting  better stick to the museum.
December,3,2022,5.0,A must see when in Athens,A must see when in Athens. It is a wonderful experience to see a world-famous ancient sites in person.
December,2,2022,5.0,World Famous for a Good Reason,Very historic  very beautiful and dominated the view in Athens. Visiting the site is highly recommended  it is impressive close-up as much as from down below around Athens night and day.  One thing I would do differently if I visit Athens again  though  I would visit the Acropolis Museum before I visit Acropolis. And visit Acropolis in the late afternoon before it closes as it has much less people.  Great view of Athens from above.
November,29,2022,5.0,Amazing History,This place is a must to visit. The wonders of ancient construction and how they have withstood everything time has thrown at it. How they managed to build such structures with so much accuracy and strength is amazing. (Probably within budget too)
November,29,2022,5.0,No wonder it is one of the 7 wonders of the world.,Just to look at it. The museum is a must and I would check it out first before exploring the acropolis. In fact the museum is one of the best in the world.
November,28,2022,5.0,Of Course !!! Most famous attraction in Athens,"You cannot ""not go"" to the Acropolis when in Athens. Actually nothing more interesting in the city besides this. Amazing views and great history."
November,25,2022,5.0,An absolutely amazing site,This site and the Parthenon have been on my bucket list for years and they did not disappoint! So fantastic to be walking in history and the footsteps of the ancients. Recommended!!!
November,25,2022,5.0,Bringing history to life.,It was a dream come true. We toured the Acropolis with a private guide  who is an archeologist. Just an amazing experience.
November,23,2022,4.0,Lovely visit in November - AVOID KIOSK OUTSIDE TICKET OFFICE,Acropolis was great. Didn’t expect it to be so busy in November but we did go at midday. Go early morning to avoid the queue. Just a bit of advice - after purchasing our tickets we proceeded to the kiosk just opposite to get a drink of water. We asked to buy a small bottle of water and a bottle of iced tea to which the worker asked for €9.50. I was shocked and walked away without the purchase. Luckily… as once through the gate  they had vending machines selling bottles of water for 50 cents a bottle. Avoid that kiosk as it’s the biggest rip off I’ve ever come across.
November,22,2022,4.0,Amazing view,You have to be here to feel the breath of history. And admire the panorama of Athens. Which is breathtaking
November,21,2022,3.0,A requirement,You can't not go  but at the same time  it was a throng of people filing through a bunch of rocks.......it was too crowded  even in November  to really appreciate the history of what it was and where we were. People were shouting to find their missing friends  kids  parents  or tour guide  and there just wasn't any time or quiet to really appreciate the importance of the location. I left quickly and disappointed; I found visiting Pompeii or even the Colosseum much more interesting and enjoyable.
November,21,2022,5.0,A page right out of history!,Talk about walking in the footsteps of history makers! The Acropolis and all its ruins are amazing! You can’t visit Athens and miss the Acropolis.
November,18,2022,4.0,Ontop-olis,Surrealistic experience walking amongst the ancient Greek ruins dating back to the 5th Millennium BC. Good views of Athens urban sprawl from above- acropolis translated literally means highest point. Little disappointed that Parthenon was covered in scaffolding and you couldn't go into the temple of Athena. **Tip- free walking tour ends minutes away from the entrance & gives you a good historical background of the place. 20 Euro entrance during summer months--10 Euro off season. Students enter for free (or so I hear).
November,17,2022,4.0,A Must visit,You can't go to Athens and not visit this attraction. It's hard work walking up and down the site and it is sometimes slippy underfoot.
November,17,2022,5.0,"Bit disappointing as it's stripped of all its marbles, but still worth visiting",Absolutely wonderful  well worth visiting. It would be better if they had a few more info boards at the top. Some of it is reconstructed which is also a little disappointing and sometimes it is hard to tell what is original and what it is not. It is a bit of a building site which some big cranes there and scaffolding up one side. It is also a bit disappointing how all the marbles have been stripped from it. Nonetheless it is still worth visiting.
November,15,2022,5.0,"Essential Athens experience, not to miss!",A climb up the Acropolis did not disappoint! I used an audio guide from Key Tours and enjoyed that. The weather was lovely in mid November - not too hot  no rain (especially glad for that as marble steps would be slippery). Plenty of people at the top but not too crowded.
November,15,2022,4.0,A Must See but Crowded and Lack of Information Panels,We visited the site as part of the €30 combined ticket (gets you access to 7 sites). The route up to the Parthenon is not particularly well signed and there is plenty to see along the way so no need to hurry. It's not very accessible as the ground is very uneven but there were wheelchairs on the top  but the access was not well marked. The main focus is the Pantheon and is a remarkable building. There is a lot of work going on  but it was not clear what the ultimate aim of that is. Our visit was in November and the heat and crowds were just about tolerable  but I assume that it must be almost unbearable in the height of summer. A little on the downside is the usual few people more intent on their Instagram poses than the site itself. One of the best parts of the Acropolis and Parthenon is that you can see it from almost every part of Athens. If you visit the Acropolis first  you will get much more out of your visit to the Acropolis Museum afterwards.
November,15,2022,5.0,Interesting Place to Visit,It's a great and amazing place to visit. It's interesting to learn its history. I was excited to see the rock where Apostle Paul preached gave his speech about the unknown God.
November,13,2022,4.0,"Touristy, but necessary",We decided to tour later in the afternoon at 4pm. The person at the ticket window said that they would be closing at 5pm which surprised us since it was plainly mentioned on the sign and website that they close at 8pm. So we booked it up the hill and didn't really stop a lot to read. It was still crowded and we slowed down to read and take pics of the Parthenon and other ruins at the top. Also it was super hot so remember to bring water. After 5pm we noticed no one was kicking us out so we relaxed a little (obviously they weren't closing). We sat and just embraced the fact that we were in a very cool place. We stayed almost 2 hours and then walked around the Plaka.  Use the Dionysus Theater (side) entrance for shorter lines  we walked right in. Also please wear appropriate footwear and be super careful when walking on the slick marble. We saw people fall while we were there.
November,13,2022,5.0,Must see,The time here was well worth the time so much history if you love history this is a must see.There was plenty of time to enjoy the sights and learn about the history.
November,11,2022,5.0,Acropolis - Breathtaking,What an experience. I highly recommend doing the guided tour of the Acropolis. My advice  go as early as you can. It can get incredibly busy and crowded. The views were stunning  the history is breathtaking. Do yourself a favor and visit.
November,10,2022,5.0,Crowded but fabulous,Been there back in 1989 when you could walk anywhere you wanted and it wasn't that crowded. Now you need to follow a path and it's really crowded. That said  it is wonderful and a must see. We did a tour and had an excellent guide which made it even better. You could do it on your own but the tours are cheap and if you get a good guide  it's great.
November,10,2022,5.0,You can't go to Athens and fail to visit the Acropolis,The Acropolis is actually the name of the hill on which the Parthenon and other structures stand. It is a fascinating piece of history. You'll see the temples of Athena and have a great view of the entire city below
November,10,2022,4.0,A must see,You can’t visit Athens without visiting the Acropolis. It’s €10 each (Nov) and the views from the top are stunning. It’s always a shame to see all the scaffolding but the repairs & refurbishing has to be done. Overall a lovely place to visit provided the weather is nice. The rocks are very slippery up there.
November,9,2022,5.0,Awesome place.,Visited in late september  early october (perect time) not cowded ad super nice. Reasonable prices on food  souveniers  etc.. Really liked this place.
November,9,2022,5.0,A great and histotical place,A great and histotical place. Visiting Acropolis you have a great view but also a strange feeling about this buildings. We feel so lucky to have this Monument in our Country. It is a must visit if you come to Greece. Also dont forget to visit the White Tower in Thessaloniki! It is onother great building in a beautiful city!
November,7,2022,5.0,Must See!,The reason for our visit to Athens and it certainly didn’t disappoint! So much to look at  it must be seen to understand the scale of the monuments. It really is difficult to wrap your head around just how old the structures are! Lots of uphill walking on some fairly worn paths and steps  so comfortable shoes are essential  and plenty of drinking water too. But so worth the climb for views of the city from the top of the hill. Plenty of information boards for those who explore alone instead of with a tour guide.
November,7,2022,4.0,Rich Steves had it right - just go to the Acropolis. Getting there can be a challenge if you like Uber as it is no more!,We did Mars Hill first  then put on Rick Steves and walked up the southern entrance. Tip: bring along a split screen of old and current views - as it does take a bit of imagination to visualize it in its original glory.  You take a gamble getting a cab as you will here that it depends on traffic. Uber listed only taxis and a price of 1-16 euro… they are charging 25-35 euro depending on what they can get out of you. I took the second car for 20 Euro but TIP: kept the Uber App on so i could track if the taxi driver decided to take the “grand tour”. No Meter in sight. Argued for 15 minutes - absolutely nuts! Please bring Uber back! I will pay more just to have some one civil in the drivers seat!
November,6,2022,5.0,Amazing experience,Probably the best experience I ever had in my life. I felt like having wine with the ancient philosophers. The architecture was on an other level
November,6,2022,5.0,A must see,Sent in late October when it was not quite as busy. Wear decent walking shoes as some areas are a bit sloppy due to centuries of feet walking over them(!) You can't help but marvel at the sight and how it was built.
November,6,2022,5.0,"Incredible, a must see!",Really incredible. Unbelievable that these structures have stood for so long. Difficult to imagine how they were built with the resources they had. Amazing views and a wonderful experience. Take water with you!
November,1,2022,5.0,Quite the Hill!,Seen from so many areas of the city  there is so much to experience by spending time visiting this historical hill.
November,1,2022,5.0,Impressive and awe inspiring,To think that the Athenians did all the work themselves without relying on slaves was impressive. There was so many details about this visit that going without a guide is out of the question
November,1,2022,5.0,Athen’s landmark,Low season (half) price from November first. Ten Euros.  Seems most go early  so you may try midday Instead  and use lower back entrance.  Wear good walking shoes  and beware... some marbles and stones are very slippery.  Can make sense to bring a small bottle of water if temperature is hot.  Round off with lunch afterwards  but best as far away from the tourist path as possible  unless you wish to pay too much.
October,31,2022,5.0,Not to be missed,What can be said that hasn't been said already about this magnificent place? It's beauty  it's history  it's importance is not to be missed. The Acropolis is a one of a kind.
October,30,2022,4.0,Amazing place,Very very busy  get there ready to go in as soon as it opens. Watch out for pick pockets outside the site.
October,28,2022,3.0,visit if you have nothing better to do,it was ok. a piece of history. very crowded. some marble stones. it’s worth the visit if you’re in athens. some of the marble floor on the hill is really slippery and so it becomes a bit annoying.
October,28,2022,5.0,no1 attraction in Athens,one of the best sites to visit while in Athens. Start your day early to avoid the queue. The view from the top is spectacular . worth visiting the Acropolis museum
October,27,2022,4.0,Worth the hike up the hill.,Spectacular views and worth the long walk. Its best to get the €30 ticket so you can see all the sites even though their dotted around the city. Take a good camera and plenty of fluids.
October,25,2022,5.0,So impressive,You hear about it but in person  it is so incredibly impressive. We bought our tickets online and were there when the gates opened at 8:00. We had it to ourselves.
October,25,2022,5.0,Amazing Views,The entire hill and surrounding area is beautiful. It is a good 20-30 minute walk around the complex itself from the lower street level  but it is worth the walk. You have to purchase tickets to see all of the ruins and sites of the Acropolis  however the walk around the bottom is another excellent way to see what is above you.
October,24,2022,5.0,It will blow you away.,We did a private tour. Our guide took us to the museum first and explained the history of this amazing site to us first. She was right about us understanding what we are looking at once we went up to the site itself. The majesty of the site blow us away when we went up to the site. Go see this place for sure if you are ever in Athens.
October,24,2022,4.0,Only need basic ticket for Acropolis,This really is a must see place in Athens. However  they offer a 20 euro ticket  or a 30 euro ticket taking in more places... In our opinion you only need the 20 Euro Acropolis and slopes ticket. We saw many of the extra places through their railings  the one place we did go in didn't seem worth it once you've seen the Acropolis. You should however pay to go see the Acropolis museum as it makes sense of the site. Amazing artifacts and information!
October,22,2022,5.0,Always a must do when in Athens,Visiting Athens this is a must see. I have visited the Acropolis twice on separate visits to Athens and it never gets old. Be sure to wear comfortable clothing and good walking shoes because there is a good walk up to the site. I've noticed on this visit that more areas were roped off and mkre personnel watching people closely so you can't get as close to the ruins as in the past  but I'm sure it's because of humans not taking care to the site. Also  the views from the top of the hill offers great photo ops.
October,22,2022,5.0,Not to be missed,Try to visit early as you can queue for a while to purchase your ticket. Do not be put off by the steps as you can find alternative routes to the top. You cannot visit Athens without visiting this incredible site.
October,21,2022,3.0,Interesting but a bit of a letdown,I've wanted to visit this for years and so finally got to this year. Despite all of the tour info  it's really easy to walk up if you are moderately healthy. There are loads of restaurants and watering holes at the bottom of the hill and of course shops!  Some guides say buy tickets in advance  but we didn't and it wasn't any hassle  although an a busy day/time that could be different.  Take care once you have paid and are through the gates because the stone/marble is shiny for a reason... It's very slippery in places even in the baking sun!  The views from the top are remarkable and worth the visit.
October,21,2022,5.0,This is why one comes to Athens,Wow! This is what Athens is about. Yes  the climb is steep in places  but the summit is what it is all about. My recommendation is either ener or leave by the south entrance. If you only use the west entrance you miss the views of the theaters. Spend time at sites and sit and people watch.
October,20,2022,5.0,Worth the Hike Up to the Top,This was the best sight we visited in Athens. It appears that Athens was flattened 4 times through out history and there is not much left thats worth visiting. One of the few exceptions is the Acropolis. It towers over the city with spectacular views. The structures that remain after being built in the 5th century BC are impressive. Make sure you take a guide or read up on the history of the sight  its very interesting.
October,19,2022,5.0,Indrukwekkend,Friendly people helped us up the hill. We couldn’t use the elevator since i use a sort of wheelchair.
October,18,2022,3.0,Too many people ruin the experience,This is a fascinating place  but has been ruined by the number of people allowed there at a time  and the ignorance and lack of courtesy of these people. I would be willing to pay more to visit the area without the crowds. It would also be improved if everyone had to take a guided tour. There were far too many people being stupid and rude. The endless posing for selfies everywhere has gotten out of hand. Enjoy the views from afar  and skip the climb up.
October,17,2022,5.0,Impressive,Just awesome. Must see in athens. there is normally a longer line at the ticket counter. If you want to skip the line  buy the ticket online or at the ticket machine near by. To go up there are at least sneakers recomendable. A lot of stones and when it rains its very slippery. If you want to do the tour by yourself you have to read a lot  otherwise you will have just a few nice pictures :). There is no audio tour available. At the moment a part of the phartenon is under construction. impressive architecture up there and a wonderful view over athens.
October,17,2022,5.0,Wonderful experience,Well worth visiting  you can’t visit Athens and not visit the Acropolis. There’s much to see and learn. Be prepared for the crowds.
October,17,2022,1.0,Beware of sadistic staff!!!,A gorgeous view from up top  and fascinating history! Best to hire a guide. But unfortunately  what really made this place a MAJOR disappointment was the absolutely manical staff members walking around the archeological sites  trying to be incognito but with walkie talkie’s at full volume  yelling at visitors in broken English who were taking pictures and otherwise trying to enjoy themselves. These wannabe psycho cops were demanding that people delete certain photos from their phones and cameras because they were “promoting”. What does that even mean?? So someone can’t hold a can of Pepsi in a photo or wear a t-shirt with any sort of logo on it?? The most ungrateful  ridiculous display of power tripping I honestly have ever witnessed ANYWHERE in the world. It was almost like they were trying to demean and scare people just for the fun of it. Sick! The employees would stalk and harass the visitors  yelling at them and threatening to call the police  who would “take their phones” if they didn’t immediately delete the photos that these Acropolis staff members saw as being “promotional”. Not anyone (from what I saw) was doing anything obscene or remotely inappropriate  just some hugs  thumbs up  peace signs  and a few other random poses. Sure  people were excited  but what’s wrong with that? It was extremely sad to witness terrified visitors from all over the world  some who were even crying  being threatened that they would be thrown into some Greek jail for taking pictures on their vacations. Including several people who were celebrating their honeymoon!  Shame on these bully Acropolis employees (who wouldn’t even identify themselves  state their position or names or show any form of ID)  for actively trying to ruin tourists vacations. Especially since for many people  like myself  this is the first vacation we’ve had since the pandemic. Many traveller’s are still traumatized and extra sensitive to begin with after a very scary past couple of years. They should never be put in such a threatening and abusive situation by anyone  especially after paying their hard earned money to enter this site.  These staff members are an embarrassment to the Acropolis and to Greece in general (one of the most hospitable countries in the world)  and are literally biting the hands that feed them. They are clearly taking out their negativity and anger in life on innocent visitors  many of whom don’t even understand English. Disgraceful.  To risk having your visit ruined by these unhinged tyrants  I recommend saving your 20 euro admission and going elsewhere. And I hope whoever controls and runs this Acropolis operation reads this review  and takes SERIOUS corrective measures. I (and others) will be posting some videos very soon on other social media platforms to let people judge the situation for themselves.
October,16,2022,3.0,Good for what it is.,Amazing history here… but it is ruins. See it  take in the awesomeness of the events that occurred here  but then go find some other experiences while you are here. You don’t have to give it a whole day.
October,16,2022,1.0,Go only if you want instagramm picture,In best days it was amazing place  but now those are ruins and pile of stones. Climb was easy  but once in top there is not very much to look or wonder about... Acropolis definetly better is admired from distance.  And it was a bit sireal that they were selling beer to even kids as refreshing but no water - in all 5 places there were signs - NO WATER ONLY BEER.  And yes - they sell ticket for slopes but one was closed while other was open for everybody...
October,16,2022,2.0,5 day pass is not what it seems.,"It appears if you buy the 30 euro ""5 day pass"" its not what it seems. You actually only get one use entry per site and the Acropolis is ""connected"" to another site so if you make the mistake of going to one and not both on the same day then you will need to buy another separate ticket. They dont make this clear and certainly not at the ticket office. Left a very sour taste in my mouth for Greece and my trip."
October,14,2022,4.0,It’s the Acropolis….,Went to the ticket kiosk in the morning and bought the combo ticket  but went and visited some of the other sites first to allow the tours and cruise ship visits to clear out of the way. Yes  in early October Athens is still very busy with tourists. Returned to the site about3pm in the afternoon and although still lots of people  didn’t have to queue to get through the ticket gate and once on the site  plenty of room to wander and look at the ruins. Stunning views from the top and great to finally see the temples and other buildings.
October,13,2022,5.0,Well worth the crowd,It was a hot monday morning and tourists were everywhere to be seen. At first we were not sure if to join the crowds BUT glad we did. The history and scenery were spectacular
October,13,2022,4.0,"Steep climb, but worth the view",A steep climb to the top  but worth the view. It can be very dangerous climbing the steep incline  so not recommended for those with mobility issues. The ticket lady was very rude  but I did not let her spoil my experience. Also  it's no secret that work is being done to preserve the landmarks. Complaining about it is really a waste of words. Nevertheless  I enjoy my hike and the moment of joy visiting a site on my travel bucket list.
October,13,2022,5.0,Incredible !!,We decided to use the side entrance opposite the museum as this seemed considerably quieter then the main entrance by avoiding all of the buses. It is also well worth buying your ticket from one of the machines as this avoids the queues  we found no need to book on-line in advance.  The multi-site ticket also provides you entrance to several other sites including Hadrian's Library  Ancient Agora of Athens and Temple of Olympian Zeus making it excellent value for money.  After your visit it’s well worth venturing up Philopappos Hill to see the monument and gain the best view of the Acropolis site in Athens.
October,11,2022,5.0,Stunning! Fascinating!,The Acropolis is the area where the Parthenon is located. It is filled with the the ruins of the past including temples and theatres. To reach the Parthenon you have to walk up many  many steps  inclined walkways in dirt and gravel. Be prepared!
October,11,2022,4.0,Busy busy,A must see when in Athens. Would have been 5 star but the crowds are overwhelming. Don't waste time taking photos  just enjoy it and download them later.
October,10,2022,5.0,A Highlight of our 3 week Mediterranean trip,The grandeur and significance of this site is beyond explanation. Get there early. It's very handicapped friendly as well.
October,10,2022,5.0,Go early to beat the crowds,An absolute must see  if you do one thing in Athens it must be this.  I arrived at 8.30 to find several coach tours arriving at the same time  I thought it was a bit busy but it was nothing compared two hours later - get there as early as you can and come prepared with water and a hat as there is no shade up on the hill.  There are two entrances  the main entrance which takes you in right at the Beule gate and Propylaia  through which you will get to the Parthenon. The other entrance via the South slopes takes you via the Theatre of Dionysus and other smaller sites. Regardless which entrance you come in  I’d recommend going straight to the Parthenon and other main sites before it gets too busy  the coach tours and cruise ships won’t bother with the smaller sites on the south slopes  they were much quieter and I wandered through them on my way down.  A combination ticket for 7 sites in total is 30 euros.
October,10,2022,5.0,History up close and personal.,This is a must see sight when you are in Athens. Bring good walking foot shoes 👞 and plan on spending atleast four hours of climbing and going down some uneven pathways. Remember this is how the ancient Greek world lived. You will get your Hart pumping.
October,9,2022,5.0,Walking in history,You walk where western civilization began. Good view of the city - watch out for scam prices on the water - there are vending machines on the site where you can buy water for 50 cents.
October,8,2022,5.0,Wonderful,What you can say... Jast Amazing Place !It was my second visit and they had improved a lot the service !
October,7,2022,5.0,Biblical,It’s so amazing to see buildings that are still there after 3300 years. Took over 50 years to build. Only wished we had found the elevators before coming down. It would have been more helpful for elderly and handicap. The view was amazing.
October,6,2022,3.0,A magnificent spectacle,The Museum was the best part of this attraction. The ruins themselves are magnificent but on a hot  crowded day  there should be vendors with water and umbrella rentals on the site.
October,5,2022,5.0,First time in Athens.,Excellent tour guide. Private full-day tour. Our tour guide did not skip a beat he went beyond our expectations.
October,4,2022,5.0,Must see in Athens,Once in a lifetime experience. It’s too bad Italians damaged the place badly  and lord Elgin robbed it. Be sure to get bottles of water before you get to the entrance to avoid paying 4.50 euro at the small stand by the entrance. Note that only water allowed; no colored liquids.
October,4,2022,5.0,No words can describe,With a view of the coast and city in addition to the spectacular ruins  this amazing historic site is a must see for travelers.
