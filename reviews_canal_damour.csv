"October 30, 2022",5.0,Beautiful place to swim,"A beautiful area to visit that is easily accessible by car with free parking. We started with a walk up the cliffs to see the stunning views on offer which was wonderful. We then pitched up on the small beach and dived into the sea. We swam through the ‘tunnel of love’ and spent some time jumping into the water. We then spent some time snorkelling further out to sea. It was truly a stunning place to swim with the beautiful coves and cliffs. However, I wouldn’t recommend if you are planning on sunbathing as the beach is small and I would imagine it would get very overcrowded during peak season."
"October 28, 2022",4.0,Popular and stunning attraction.,Take the cliff path route to Canel D'Amour past restaurants commanding beautiful views over the little beaches and bays below. Great place to sunbath and watch the braver ones jump and dive from small cliffs into the blue waters below but have to admit i didnt attempt it myself.....too my birthdays.There is also a sheltered sandy beach which can become very crowded at times and just above this is outdoor restaurant with panoramic views while enjoying a meal or a cool drink.
"October 6, 2022",4.0,Nice area,"Lovely area, nice scenery and plenty of shops, restaurants and bars to choose from. Some parts (i.e. the small beaches) can get a bit crowded but it's nice for a leisurely stroll."
"October 5, 2022",5.0,Canal D'Mour,"It is a beautiful place to visit with nice restaurants with beautiful views of the sea, some nice shops and bars, if you are fit you can go looking over the hill a lot easier as I have limited mobility I was unable to go there but it looked wonderful, we had some lovely meals at he Sea Garden and the Marie Beach Hotel, also if you go onto the beach you can hire a boat"
"September 27, 2022",5.0,Stunning views,"Definitely a must to visit. We stayed in Sidari and walked . Which was a pleasant walk even in the heat . I would recommend suitable footwear for the rocks and climbing even though lots had flip flops on. Stunning views and great atmosphere. It’s very busy which is expected as soon popular , it’s a must even if it’s just to take in the whole experience and get great photos. Beach was very busy but people coming and going so was easy to get a space . Sea was lovely and great for swimming the mud is great also to put on you write your name in the mud wall. People were jumping from high heights (not for us) good to watch swim through the caves . We didn’t eat or drink there but a few places to eat and drink near. Lovely part of Sidari. People were having a great time."
"September 24, 2022",2.0,Crowded and not sure what all the fuss is about,Pleasant enough beach but very small and was crowded. There are much nicer beaches available by car.
"September 22, 2022",5.0,Fagins bar and restaurant,"Loved the Canal D'Amour its lively but quieter than the main strip. A nice ammount of bars and taverna's and a couple of shops. Visited Fagins every day for breakfast which was lovely, plenty of options and service was fabulous. Sharon was very friendly and attentive, however we did go for our evening meal a couple of times and it was a different story. The food was perfect but the host Donna was very unorganised and often got ours and other orders wrong or mixed up. She just didnt listen to the customer so it all became a bit of a lucky bag. Nothing like the morning service Im sorry to say."
"September 20, 2022",2.0,Small crowded beach - lots of litter,"Small crowded beach - lots of litter, no sunbeds of umbrellas as shown on some photos & nowhere to clean the sand off your feat."
"September 18, 2022",3.0,Disappointed,"Very busy through the day, staying in the area so visited late when crowds disappeared. No where near as romantic as described probably because of crowds and rubbish left behind."
"September 7, 2022",5.0,Beautiful,"Worth to visit. The litle cave gives the best view if You aproach from the see, after You swimm trought the canal. Big parking lot at the entrance, costs 5 euro/day."

"August 31, 2022",3.0,Canal dmour,Nice spot to view out at sea or grab a drink/swim/snack .once you've seen it I don't think you need to go back.there were people sunbathe but why I don't know.id rather be on a sunbed than a hard rock .
"August 31, 2022",5.0,Marvellous,"Stunning views, warm water. You can swim into the Dionisos cave or jump from a cliff. The beach is easily accessible."
"August 19, 2022",5.0,Definitely worth a visit,"Beautiful, best in the early morning before the crowds. Good selection of restaurants nearby, and other sandy coves. Orange cake at Aquarius Restaurant (Kanali hotel) highly recommend."
"August 15, 2022",2.0,Overrated waste of time,"What marketing and some touristy ad words can do is best seen here - Canal D'Amour,...wooow A stretch of limestone cliffs which eroded due to sea currents and waves and made a small bay. First of all, don't expect it looks like on the headline pic. In reality the water is murky and the whole area smelly. The beach is very small and overcrowded. As many others said, there's a lot of litter from visitors bringing food and drinks. The cape stretching out to the sea is nice for a pic, yet dangerous to walk on it. Despite a heavy heat I had no desire to swim there. I'd rather consider it a quick photo op if you have nothing else to do. We were staying in a hotel few kms away, but I wouldn't bother coming here from more remote areas on Corfu."
"August 9, 2022",4.0,"Interesting rock formation, shame about the litter!","This is an unique beach with interesting clay rock formations. From a distance it looks fabulous. On closer inspection, not so! The amount of rubbish in the surrounding area above the beach on the cliffs, and piled at the bottom of the steps of the tiny beach area, was shocking! What is it with visitors? Can't they take their rubbish back to the hotel with them? The water was however lovely and swimming through the cave area was exciting, however strongish swimmers only."
"August 6, 2022",5.0,Beautiful beach,"If you stay in Sidari, you must go to Canal D'Amour. You will not regret it. Enjoy a fruit salad and a ice coffee (frapi)."
"August 6, 2022",5.0,Canal D'Amour August 2022,"A lovely natural little formation of rock and sea. Situated just outside the main strip of Sidari, approx 800m, this rock formation provides an inlet of about 100m from the main coast line inland. At the foot there is a small beach accessed via a sharp drop in rock formation and steps. Swimming out to sea there is a little cave to swim through which is a unique experience.  Well worth a visit, and will fill an hour or two of your day. Consider combining this with other points of interest in the area to make a great day out."
"August 5, 2022",5.0,Lovely place but only for strong swimmers,"Great place lots of surrounding bars if you want a drink or food, several different little inlets and good access for all."
"July 20, 2022",5.0,Unique beach,"Beautiful coast line, that includes several beaches and the unique Cabal no Al D’amour. Very nice views. You could also spend time on the beach or at one of near by bars."
"July 20, 2022",5.0,Breathtaking!!,Love this beautiful place. Outstanding natural beuty perfect spot for photos! Definitely stop here if you are visiting Sidari.
"July 18, 2022",1.0,Not as good as the pictures,"We were really disappointed with this. The water looked really dirty, the access was very uneven and there was loads of litter stacked up that had not been removed. Would not race back here!"
"July 14, 2022",3.0,"Nice at sunset, don’t bother during the day","Nice to visit at sunset, we were staying nearby and would walk along the tops some evenings as the sunset is lovely. Not sure how it can even be classed as a beach as the beach is barely even big enough for 2 or 3 towels is just really a way to get into the water.  Hot and hard work in the day, lots and lots of groups on tours who leave all their rubbish around the too small bins. Often very windy and big waves when we were there which was nice to look at but wouldn’t risk swimming. Really scruffy around it derelict land, abandoned sun beds, rubbish etc seems such a shame.  Nice place to walk to in the evening but I would have been disappointed to tAke a trip to specifically visit."
"July 6, 2022",2.0,Don’t bother!,"Very disappointed, the smell gets you first from the dirty stagnant water , worse on a windy day! Litter was everywhere. Tiny beach . Much nicer places to visit in Corfu."
"June 25, 2022",1.0,It is a very cheap tiny place,"There are so many people trying to scramble into this very tiny space, it is just a joke. There are nasty touristic spaces that surrounds this vile place with many dubious people around."
"June 23, 2022",5.0,Well worth visiting,"Great natural rock formation slowly being eaten away by gentle wave action. It wasn't too busy when we visited, so no need to plan your visit. Although the beach is tiny, most visitors tend to sit high up on the rocks at the side. Definitely take the opportunity to swim in the sea, making sure you swim though the tunnel through the rock which is only about 30 metres long. Look back at the rock formation when in the tunnel! It is possible to swim out to sea and round the headland to re-entre the bay. I was warned the tide was strong here, but that wasn't my experience. It is also a great place to watch sunset. It's a free visitor attraction which is rare, so make the most of it. Some layers in the rock are soft clay-like substance. I'm told rubbing it on your face and letting it dry, takes years off you - I'll let others judge if it has!"
"June 18, 2022",5.0,True beauty,Absolutely beautiful views and definitely worth a visit! I would recommend sensible footwear as the best views are achieved by a bit of climbing over rocks. There is a beach where you can swim and places to dive from as well
"June 14, 2022",4.0,Well worth seeing unlike its’ neighbour Cape Drastis!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Corfu and earlier today we went on a day trip to Ericusa and briefly stop to see both Cape Drastis and Canal D’Amour en route back to the Sidari.  Of the two, Canal D’Amour was by far the most impressive - and should, if at all possible, be seen from a boat - with Cape Drastis rather underwhelming! So much so, that I - for one - will be in no great hurry to see it again!"
"June 14, 2022",5.0,Would recommend visiting,"Really worth a visit, natural beauty and thrilling. Can relax on the rock edge and also really good area for rock jumping, if you know how to. Would definitely come back here."
"June 10, 2022",5.0,Absolutely beautiful,"If there is something to see in this area, this is it. The rock formations are beautiful and you can swim around them. If you are brave enough, you can try climbing out under the rocks and explore the little caves and tunnels."
"June 3, 2022",4.0,Europe 21st century?,"Canal d' Amour visit today, loved going through it but was horrified by the pile of rubbish at the top of the stairs."
"May 28, 2022",5.0,Amazing views,Canal D'Amour is the most beautiful place we have been too. There are bars there so you can eat/drink while looking at the stunning views.
"May 17, 2022",4.0,Amazing rock formation,"A place to visit in Corfu but especially for geological reasons. Beautiful rock formations, the erosion makes the rocks spectacular, the water is amazing. If you go to the Canal d'Amour to spend a day on the beach u could be disappointed because it's a crowded place and the beach is small and not sandy. We were amazed by the view but we left for a better sandy beach and there're a lot nearby."
"May 15, 2022",3.0,Such a shame,The canal is beautiful area in Sidari where the sand and limestone rocks have been eroded by sea and wind to form beautiful shapes.It is also famous for watching beautiful sunsets.however the steps that lead down to the beach are broken and dangerous and unless you are quite fit you cannot get down to swim.Considering this is a very busy area with hundreds of visitors a day it surprises me that the north Corfu council not only leave it open but make no effort to make it accessible and safe or clear the rubbish from the beach
"May 9, 2022",5.0,Beautiful place with beautiful people,"Gorgeous and well worth a look and spend the day. With plenty of good restaurants in the area. And loads of pools you can spend the day around, as long as you buy some drinks. We always had our lunches out"
"November 7, 2021",3.0,Go in the early morning to enjoy the views,"Some nice rock formations. The surrounding small beaches get crowded after breakfasts, so if you want to enjoy the unspoiled views, it's best to go there in the early morning."
"November 7, 2021",5.0,Well worth a visit,Recommend a visit here outstanding location breath taking views a few bars and restaurants nearby as well to try
"October 13, 2021",1.0,Overrated,"We had heard and read great reviews about the Canal d‘Amour, promising a romantic spot with amazing views and the opportunity for a swim in a unique and beautiful location. What you get instead is a small formation of mud and rocks right behind a bunch of cheap hotels and bars right in the middle of a busy, touristy village. It‘s absolutely crowded with people trying to take a photo or go swim at the incredibly tiny beach area that fits approx. 4 people. There is nothing remotely romantic about this place, don‘t be fooled. Unless you consider piles of rubbish on the grounds, crowds of people and loud music romantic. Don’t waste your time coming here when there are way more beautiful coves and beaches all over the island!"
"October 5, 2021",4.0,lovely spot,"great little place to visit and bathe, nice surroundings, cliff walks, plenty of bars ,cafes etc very laid back"
"September 28, 2021",2.0,Overrated doesn't even begin to describe it.,"People rave about this place as if it's a sight to behold. Sorry, but it just isn't. It's some jagged rocks, surrounded by tacky hotels and takes a grand total of two minutes to look around."
"September 28, 2021",4.0,A magical place,The place is beautiful as advertised definitely worth the trip and the dip. Hiring a kayak just next to the place and exploring the cave and tunnel is spectacular. Strong currents during tides be extra careful if you swim it. The Hotels around it make it a bit overcrowded at peak seasons besides that warmly recommended
"September 27, 2021",5.0,Lovely place to relax and enjoy,"After reading the previous reviews I felt I had to write my own as it was so unjust. The Canal D Amour is an area of natural beauty. There are various bays to look at with interesting rock formations in the sea. If you don’t take the time to explore then yes, you may only see the small strip of beach on which to sunbathe. Look to the local beach bar what a lovely place to eat reasonably priced food of very high quality then check out the area on the cliffs to sunbathe on and the other beaches and shallow caves, all with stunning views. Yes, there aren’t concrete pavements everywhere just normal pavement.  I honestly feel some people should stay in their built up cities and leave beautiful areas like the Canal D Amour for those of us who appreciate natural beauty. Oh and the nearby Sidari strip is only a 10 minute walk away for a lively night if that’s what you want to do all good in small measure."
"September 26, 2021",5.0,must see,"a little bit crowded, but a place with great water and the canal that everyone can swim through. It's interesting to experience."
"September 21, 2021",3.0,a little underwhelming,access not maintained and a bit scruffy but the views from local restaurants and bars very nice a smelly river nearby avoided
"September 13, 2021",5.0,Beautiful scenery,"I’m surprised at some of the negative views on this place, the sea was crystal clear and people were jumping off the cliffs into the sea. Stunning scenery and I so wish we had our swimming gear with us. We got some stunning photos and had one of the best days of our holiday. Would definitely return."
"September 12, 2021",1.0,Rubbish strewn dump,"I’m sure this was pretty once, but it is now a rubbish strewn dump (rubbish in the water and overflowing bins on the paths approaching the beach). Surrounded by nasty, half built hotels and bars. If this is one of the best things to do in Corfu, I’d hate to see the worst."
"September 4, 2021",5.0,Beautiful beach and surroundings,Really loved the Canal d'Amour beach and surroundings. It did get busy at times during the day but was nice and quiet in the evening. Beautiful spot for a nice family photo.
"August 31, 2021",3.0,Too crowded,"We went there by car, horrible to get there and not clearly instructed by road signs where to go. Parking spot was on the top of a hill with (luckily) just 1 spot left for our car. When we arrived at Canal d’ amour it was crowded like crazy, a lot of kids blasting all sorts of music through speakers. On the small beach part there were barely any spots to leave your stuff (definitely no lying down there) the canal itself was crowded with swimmers too, the waters were good and there was a nice little cave nearby which u could swim through. In my opinion it isn’t worth it to go there again. Just took the swim and got away as fast as possible."
"August 28, 2021",5.0,Amazing views and such a fun day,PLEASE visit Canal D'Amour whilst in Sidari!  One day during our holiday we just went for a stroll and came across this amazing beach. We were so happy to have found it and visited 2 times after that.  The views are breathtaking.  We hired a pedalo for an hour for €10 which we thought was so good for the location and it really did make the trip that whole lot better.  If you're looking for a spot for lunch whilst here definitely go to Canal D'Amour Beach Bar and Restaurant!
"August 19, 2021",4.0,Nice for a short visit,"Nice place, very romantic. We stopped there for about 45 minutes, just the time to get refreshed and swim. There was a beautiful passage under the cliff where swimmers can pass through and take some picts if they have a waterproof camera. Shame the water was a bit cloudy, but I guess it was because of the terrain which was kind of clayish and slippery."
"August 17, 2021",5.0,Great,"Idyllic beach and surprisingly not crowded, despite being a famous tourist spot. There are a few caves to explore a short swim away."
"August 16, 2021",2.0,Good for a nice walk around,"If you want to make a trip, plan to visit for 20 mins max and have other plans for the day too. Keep your expectations low and you will have great experience. Make a short walk, take some pics and move on.  Corfu has other great places worth to see!"
"August 15, 2021",4.0,Amazing scenery but?,"Location is beautiful. was very busy and with all the hotels above it, made it feel overcrowded and congested. Would recommend hiring a boat to view it from the seas"

Explore beyond that though and there are cliffs to sunbathe on and other beaches and shallow caves to explore in the sea, all with stunning views. Yes, there aren’t concrete pavements everywhere but this is an area of natural beauty!!! If you want a nice pavement, maybe try the prom at Benidorm. The comments about “typical hooligan British” is just ridiculous considering most British planes to the Island were grounded. I honestly feel some people should stay in their built up cities and leave beautiful areas like the Canal D Amour for those of us who appreciate natural beauty. Oh and prices are reasonable, similar to nearby Sidari."
"July 17, 2021",1.0,Terrible !! But great for Barbarians,"Worst place in corfu.  Super crowded with those typical britains that resemble hooligans and botox ladies.  I felt bad for the unlucky families that chosen that place to stay.  Beaches are dirty and lack infrastructures for proper sun bathing.  The place can be windy so prepare yourself to eat dirt. Yes , dirt! There is not even a proper side Walk there.  If you want to eat, enjoy yourself at the tastfulless restaurants with little or none quality in service and cuisine.  With that said, if you enjoy barbarian environments with terrible food, you just found paradise.  This is not greece , it stands way behind the other places corfu has to offer.  Oh, and ir ia not cheap so I would rasteje"

"June 28, 2021",4.0,"Amazing, with lots of trash","This area is stunning. I was very fortunate to arrive at a time when it wasn't terribly overrun by tourists (good for me, not good for businesses) but even with fewer tourists, so many people litter the beach and surrounding area. If you love it here so much, is it really that hard to carry out the garbage that you brought in?  The local people are lovely and you will never run out of landscape to explore along the trails. Just respect the place on your vacation, please."
"June 13, 2021",1.0,Avoid this place if you want to relax!!!,"A lot of bars, nightclubs... nothing authentic in this place. Drove the way from Kassiopi and regret it.

We went about five times
"November 14, 2020",5.0,Beautiful place,"A stunning place to visit when in Sidari. Beautiful and romantic. Lots of nice hidden coves to sunbathe and swim, definitely worth a visit, we visited twice. Stunning scenery, crystal blue waters, some lovely restaurants nearby to sit and admire the views."
"November 8, 2020",5.0,"Don't miss the beautiful water, swimming and view. Gorgeous any time of day!",Visited during the last week of October. It's hard to find your first time there. You can't access it from the main road in Sidari. You have to drive down a private looking road toward the Aquarius restaurant. You can park for free at the restaurant if you order something (which has a great view of the cliffs and water if you eat outside). Or you can just drive up past the restaurant to park in an unmarked field. It's free November-March in the off season.  The water is gorgeous and you can swim in the cave that goes under the cliff. We had a lot of fun in the water here. There is a very small rocky and sandy beach and some people lay on the cliff to sunbathe. There are many restaurants nearby but I think they all close Nov-March.

What we were met with was brilliant... a tiny high-sided cove, with a mini beach, but with cliff walls that you can jump off into to the water (varying heights to test your bravery). Great fun. Then we discovered the secret water tunnel which you can swim through. Lovers scratch their names into the sandstone walls. It is said you meet your soul mate if you swim here. Go for it."
"August 29, 2020",4.0,Nice,"Nice beach and sea gallery, but maybe nothing so special compared to others corfu interesting points."
"August 23, 2020",5.0,Simply stunning - well worth a day trip,Stunning place - Sidari was a bit too British for us to stay here for more than a day but none the less a great day out and the Canal D’Armor was a great sight and some real nice beach bars there as well.
"August 22, 2020",1.0,horrible,"The beach itself is beautiful. Unfortunately, we parked our bike close to a restaurant and when we came back the owner was shouting and being aggressive with customers from the nearby hotels and restaurants like a maniac. AVOID that restaurant at any cost, its called The Famous Canal D amour snack and pool bar. I guess it should be called the ""infamous"" canal d amour restaurant. We searched for details online about that place and there is absolutely nothing. In our hotel they told us the owner of THE FAMOUS CANAL D AMOUR is known all over the island for being a savage. We also noticed nobody was wearing a mask in the restaurant, including the owner."
"August 19, 2020",5.0,Stunning place to watch folk jump and dive into the water,"A stunning place especially at sunset, lots of people watching to be done here and with the added bonus of watching the younger people and occasionally not so young jumping and diving from the cliffs into the water below. It has the added bonus of using the natural clay to give you a free face and body scrub which most use. Beautiful spot and a must do attraction"
"August 18, 2020",5.0,Beautiful at sunset,Visited just after heavy rainfall so the canal was really quiet. The views are so lovely and the little cove round the back ideal for a visit with kids. You do have to be careful and it’s best to wear proper footwear and not flip flops. Some great photo opportunities and worth a visit.
"August 16, 2020",5.0,Gorgeous,"We have just returned from 4 nights in Sidari and visited this beach every day. The prettiest beach I’ve ever been too, lovely and spacious with comfy sun loungers belonging to bars along the beach for a small spend. Recommend going for a walk through the coves and paths to take you further along, we didn’t discover the hidden beaches until our last evening sadly!"
"August 14, 2020",5.0,Stayed at Kanali Apartments,"Visited everyday throughout our two week stay, gets very busy with tourists but lovely when quiet in the mornings and evenings."
"August 13, 2020",5.0,Our favorite place,This is indeed paradise !! Daybeds cost 5 euros. But the staff are wonderful and the atmosphere is fabulous!!! Cant wait to come back soon !
"August 13, 2020",2.0,"Avoid, especially in the afternoon","This is a tourist trap. Arrived mid afternoon and was thoroughly disappointed. sidari itself felt like a place where English tourists would go on a stag do (read, not nice), and to get.to the beach one option was to walk through a hotel. It was extremely crowded (no socia distancing during covod-19)  The beach was busy, overcrowded, the water just didn't even look as clear as other beaches . Took one look and went back to the car"
"August 12, 2020",4.0,Beautiful,This area is a must if you visit Sidari.The water was beautiful and plenty of people swimming.Lots of lovely reasonably priced bars in the area
"August 11, 2020",4.0,"Lovely sunset, good for jumping in to the sea from the rocks.",Beautiful views at sunset and a great place to swim and jump in during the day too! Would recommend and much nicer than sidari beach.
"August 8, 2020",5.0,Is it a canal ?,Leeds Liverpool canal !!!! Canal boats ! Venice canals !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gondolas ! I’m a big fan of canals and the varying floatation devices that go along canals . So me and my wife have seen this . “ canal of love “ and spent our life savings to come and see this ! We both expected big rideable swans or a heart shaped pedelo. But no . It’s just a bit of the sea with rocks either side . Maybe changing its name to bit of sea with rocks either side damour would be better .  Nice view though
"August 8, 2020",5.0,Beautiful!,"We spent a day and an evening here, and it made the holiday. Recommend getting a sun lounger through the D’amour Beach Bar and going to their Greek night."
"August 7, 2020",3.0,Arrive early morning,Arrive early morning for the best views. After 10 it’s so busy you can’t even stand up there without getting in the way of someone’s Instagram picture. I arrived at sunrise one morning and had a lovely time chilling by the sea.
"August 5, 2020",5.0,Great beaches,Due to covid we didn't want to spend too much time (none at all!) in the hotel pools and found that the beaches at Canal d'Amour were all lovely. Sea was warm and crystal clear and the beaches were mostly empty
"August 4, 2020",5.0,Beautiful place,"We were spoiled this year given the fact that they weren’t that many people due to corona. Canal d’Amour was able to shine in its beauty.  Given the popularity of the sport, there’s plenty of restaurants and accommodations very close to the beach which make it a bit overcrowded. Make sure to walk along the shoreline and watch the water and it’s amazing colors."
"August 2, 2020",5.0,Beautiful views,Beautiful views and coves for sunbathing and swimming. Lovely walk to this place from our hotel and lots of shops and places to eat along the way
"July 29, 2020",5.0,Fun nice views,Fun to go here. The Italian youngsters love to jump in The sea via the cliffs.. Such wonderful views and nice bars along the way
"July 5, 2020",5.0,Beatiful place,"Beatiful place, with warm sea. Entry free. There are beatiful views and small beach with sand. There are caves, but is there forbidden."
"February 13, 2020",5.0,Marvellous view,Lovely to walk on the cliffs round the cove also a lovely little beach where the sea is beautiful walk a bit further on you can eat and have a drink
"January 18, 2020",5.0,Beautiful at night,"I found the bed expensive but the views are breath taking especially if you love sun sets, unfortunately it gets a bit hard to swim when it’s windy as the sea gets choppy here but it really is a must see..  Don’t visit Corfu without watching a sunset here Just beautiful"
"December 30, 2019",5.0,Happy day,"Great place , you have to walk through hotel grounds to get there , good place for pit stop on the way. Can get very busy in summer months but some great views and great places to jump in if that’s your thing.id planned to jump but found it too busy and bottled it . My tip go early or late afternoon .we had a quad bike and went all over the north of the island, would go back ."
"December 28, 2019",5.0,Natural rock formation worth a visit,"It is a place worth a visit, due to spectacular views towards the sea. Unfortunately, most of the surrounding area is occupied by large hotels with eating and drinking people. Difficult to park nearby, lots of tourists on the rocks all the time. Nevertheless, worth a visit when in Corfu."
"December 12, 2019",5.0,Canal d’mor,"This is the most beautiful and tranquil spot I’ve visited on Corfu. As you walk over the bridge and up the dusty road, at the end is an entrance. Continue over the luscious grassy area and wow the scenery is breathtaking. A quaint cove with gentle lapping waves it can be quite busy but it really worth a visit to experience this for yourself."
"December 6, 2019",3.0,Not what it was (but what is?),"Last visited Canal D'Amour over 30 years ago when there were no buildings up close, but naturally over time everything changes. We were going to have a swim, but it was way too windy and rough. The canal itself has also changed, but to be expected as the surrounds/edges are quite soft and erosion does the rest. Still worth a visit."
"November 17, 2019",5.0,Beautiful canal,The canal and its surroundings are a great place for beautiful pictures. Located right next to Sidari beach.
"November 10, 2019",4.0,Over all a nice place,Stayed in Sidari for a week holiday. We enjoyed our stay because we lived close to canal d'Amour and could take some nice evening walks as there is a path a long the Beach cliffs. Unfortunately there are lots of trash around and during the day many loud tourists screaming and jumping from the cliffs..
"November 6, 2019",5.0,Pretty place,Had a lovely walk around here it has very pretty views.there are a lot of nice chilling seating areas didn't eat or drink hers but worth a visit for the viww
"November 3, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Enjoyed our visit here. After a day in the next cove on the beach we spent a good time here. Spend some time to sit and watch the water lapping, it is very peaceful in a lovely setting. People do swim between the rocks too. The formation of the rocks is quite fascinating. Worth a visit."
"October 29, 2019",5.0,Magical place,Place is easy to reach. It's full of fair rocks and blue water. It's nice to chill there and swimm if you are not affraid of deep water.
"October 24, 2019",5.0,Great Rock formations and crystal clear water,Great Rock formations and crystal clear water. The actual beach is quite small and in the shade today but there are other nice coves and beaches to also go to. A number of restaurants line the cliff tops. A very pleasant and relaxing area.
"October 22, 2019",5.0,Beauty Spot,"A really nice place to walk around during the day or simply relax at the beach. Fantastic views and natural stone landscape make for a good wander round or dip in the sea. There are various restaurants and bars to visit in the area for a bite to eat, a beer or a cocktail (all reasonably priced too). We found Canal D'amour Beach Bar great for free sunbeds, nice food and good service."
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Stunning,What a natural beauty post. Easily reached on foot. Well worth a visit.The sea is a lovely shade of blue. A photographers delight.
"October 18, 2019",5.0,Beautiful Place,"Beautiful Place to visit, must see for amazing views and to get that special picture. Small beach so need to get there early, but plenty of space on the cliff to put your towel. Lovely little cove to swim, and some days like a mill pond, loved it as it wasn't too deep and water clear."
"October 15, 2019",4.0,Sidrai,"Nice place beaches are small but realy nice to sit and relax ,plenty of bars to get a drink and food very friendly"
"October 15, 2019",5.0,Everybody is called spiros!,Excellent Everybody is friendly and there's loads to do do would recommend getting a quad and touring the island .
"October 14, 2019",5.0,lovely area,very nice area the only thing was there were lots of rubbish around seams to lack bin wagons on a regular basis
"October 13, 2019",2.0,"Too many folk, not enough room","Wanted to see this as it’s in all the sidari postcards. Glad I did, so I don’t need to see it again. Over populated, very little beach space. Never again."
"October 10, 2019",5.0,Visited canal D'Amore,"Beautiful place, worth a visit , very picturesque. not suitable for wheelchairs and reduced mobility ."
"October 10, 2019",5.0,THE BEST PART OF SIDARI,A must visit in Sidari...great for a lovely swim. Please wear sensible shoes it would be easy to slip on the rocks...lovely to watch the sun setting over the rocks and great to see them from the sea xx
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Lovely,"While staying in Sidari most nights we walked about even during the day time and the area was nice, clean and plenty of pubs and bars.  Really nice."
"October 9, 2019",5.0,Little piece of heaven,"Small but so beautiful place in Corfu. Upon arrival, you have car park available and various restaurants. My recommendation is to walk straight until you reach the canal d'amour and go down the steps for a nice swimming and relaxing. We haven't had any meal in the local restaurants."
"October 8, 2019",3.0,Nothing special,Sandy rocks and very smsll beach. I was there in october and it was full with people. I can imagine how there is during hot season.
"October 8, 2019",4.0,Sidari's only attraction,Canal D'Amour is worth visiting however Sidari is full of brits and chavs on tour. I came to corfu for the culture great Mediterranean food and landscape. Sidari is like Blackpool Barry island and benidorm combined. A forest of satellite dishes showing sport English breakfast everywhere tattoo artists bingo and book early to avoid disappointment and not getting Sunday lunch. It was such a relief to drive away. The saddest and most chav resort on corfu. Please build a trump type wall to keep the chavs in
"October 7, 2019",2.0,Very scenic … but filthy,"We walked on the cliff paths and took some nice photos of the views and the clear blue sea. But step a few feet off the paved path and the area is a litter-strewn toilet (complete with discarded bog roll). Views elsewhere on Corfu are just as nice, and considerably cleaner. I agree with other reviewers: come on bar, restaurant and hotel operators of Sidari - sort out this mess."
"October 6, 2019",5.0,Awesome views,"This is a great viewing area to take photos during the day, and at sunset, but I can only imagine how busy it gets in the summer, it was busy when we went end Sept. worth a visit if your in the area there is also a restaurant and a bar if you need refreshments. Also great if you fancy a dip in the sea or sunbathe."
"October 5, 2019",4.0,Picturesque,"A great area for taking photos,and watching the swimmers..and plenty of tavernas near by with a sea view to have a nice cool drink"
"October 4, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Not much to say accept it's a beautiful place with amazing views and scenery with nice bars/restaurants near by.
"October 3, 2019",5.0,Canal De Amour,It was very beautiful to see in person. The picture depicts the water from high above. It doesn’t look quite that blue up close. But it’s still worth a visit!
"October 3, 2019",5.0,The jewel of corfu,Absolutely stunning.after seeing it once I just kept going back.the water is turquoise blue and there are little sandy coves for sunbathing.if you want peace and quiet and stunning views try this place.
"October 2, 2019",3.0,Overrated IMHO,"Visited on a day trip to Sidari from Roda. Yes, potentially stunning but alas spoilt by its popularity. A small picturesque cove teeming with bodies! We visited in September, would only wonder what it would be like in high season. Better to use the main beach I would think 🤔"
"October 1, 2019",5.0,Well worth a visit,"We got the bus to Sidari to see this. Sidari is a dump, but don’t let that put you off. The Canal d'amour is well worth seeing."
"October 1, 2019",5.0,Holiday,"Beautiful place, we were based on the main strip last year but opted for canal damour this year and hardly left this area, its beautiful, lovely restaurants nice shops and the beaches are beautifil. Great value for money and such a mixture of people, young and older, romantic as well especially for younger couples, cant wait to go back in june"
"September 30, 2019",1.0,Waste of time,"I don't recommend this place. At first - too many people. There's tiny beach near this place so people lies on the rocks as seals... Then the rocks around this place consist of the clay and water is muddy. Maybe, sunset at this place is beautiful, but if you don't live near Sidari - don't waste your time, there are a lot of other nice places on Corfu"
"September 29, 2019",3.0,Too many people,"This is a beautiful location but there are just too many people. I've never seen such a densely packed beach. Because of all the clay, the water is cloudy so snorkelling was hopeless. We much preferred the nearby Apotripiti Beach."
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Nice views,"It’s a lovely place to have a walk round taking in the sun, far away from the strip area where things were a little different. Plenty of sun bathing and swimming around the area"
"September 29, 2019",5.0,Superb,Superb restaurant right next to Sidari Beach.We had breakfast there nearly every day before going to the beach. Sun loungers are free if you have a drink or a meal there.
"September 29, 2019",4.0,Nice,Different and glad we've seen it but to be honest it's a bit overrated in my opion. The area is dirty but that's the fault of visitors not the scenery. It's a shame that some humans feel it's ok to leave the rubbish and cigarette butts as a parting gift to future visitors
"September 28, 2019",4.0,Beautiful and relaxing,Beautiful beach with stunning views. Very busy so probably worth visiting early.  Downside was the amount of discarded rubbish and bottles and the way to Canal D'amour.
"September 28, 2019",4.0,Beach holiday,Great place to come and visit and enjoy the panoramic views . The weather helped enormously and the company of course
"September 26, 2019",5.0,Gorgeous,I think canal d’amour makes Sidari. I found some parts of Sidari quite scruffy and lacking attention yet the view from this area of the beach was really pretty.  The water so clear and blue - lovely for a swim :-)
"September 26, 2019",4.0,something different,Short walk round Sidari's beach to the headland which is almost split into two by the sea. The first inlet creates a wave-machine effect when the tide is right. The second crashes over the rocks onto the beach catching walkers unaware. A walk up through the bushes takes you to the top where the views are breath taking. Sandstone layers create wonderful photo opportunities.
"September 25, 2019",2.0,Meh,"If you are in Sidari center you can look it up, but any other time it will be a waste of time. Small beach, common views, lot of tourists and some kind of weird smell :/"
"September 25, 2019",5.0,Amazing!,Fantastic to see how the sea has eroded the rock in this area to create a deep channel with the water gushing in and out.
"September 25, 2019",5.0,site seeing,"Beautyful views and great place for swimming, take a picnic at night and sit on the rocks, not realy good if your dodgy on your legs , can be a bit slippy due to the rock formation and slopes"
"September 24, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place,Definitely recommend this place it’s so beautiful and with its beautiful beaches and restaurants.👌🏻👌🏻🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
"September 21, 2019",3.0,Canal d’amour,A good place to come to look at the sea views the canal d’amour it’s self is a bit underwhelming but it’s good to watch all the people jumping from the high rocks. And to have a refreshing swim .There is a small beach nearby and some bars and restaurants.worth a look
"September 21, 2019",5.0,amazing rock formation,"You can swim in the lovely blue warm sea, and if brave enough you can swim through the tunnel. If not you can sis on the beach and admire the view of others swimming."
"September 20, 2019",5.0,an outstanding natural landscape,"This place is only beautiful,and a must if you visit Sidari.The white cliffs,the numerous small bays with its little beaches,the color of the sea... It is worth to walk all the way around,along the coast,and also to take a boat from Cap Drastes which brings you also to the canal."
"September 19, 2019",5.0,Must see the view,"Beautiful evening views, well worth a trip, get a nice dessert from the bars and watch the sea and views. Nice desserts"

"September 16, 2019",3.0,Full of tourists,"The view is espectacular, but.... you have to cross a hotel’s pool bar to reach the place. On the beach there are a loads of dirty sunbed, the water is also dirty. We couldn’t enjoy the landscape because of the tourists. Just take a picture and go to another beach."
"September 15, 2019",5.0,Romantic at night,Very Romantic place only after 7 pm. Earlier there is a lot of people and restaurants just behind rocks. Not deep water with beatiful color.
"September 15, 2019",3.0,It's not about love,"If you've read a lot of stories about using this place to improve the quality of a relationship - be careful, swimming here is next to impossible. The water is rough and slopes are steep. It's hard to get in and even harder to get out. There is an alternative canal a little bit to the left, with a small island you can swim to."
"September 15, 2019",4.0,"Went for a morning walk here daily..small beach,very busy late morning. Went for a morning walk here daily..small beach,","Went for a morning walk here daily..small beach,very busy late morning. Preferred the main beach in sidari"
"September 14, 2019",4.0,beautiful but...,"beautiful place, but unfortunately overcrowded..... too many people, too much rubbish and noise around that it is difficult to feel the beauty of this unique place"
"September 14, 2019",2.0,Interesting to see but wouldn’t stay for longer than 10 mins,"The rock formations themselves were interesting to see for ten minutes, but the beach itself was tiny and littered. The water looked pretty dirty too."
"September 14, 2019",5.0,Nice area,Stay for 2 weeks with family and friends the area is so nice we was all jumping into the sea from the rocks which was all good fun some nice restaurants with great sea view everything close at hand bars/shops will definitely return
"September 14, 2019",5.0,Sheltered beach,A must visit lovely warm water and very shallow great for kids and adults to swim to the caves. Plenty of bars on the way and don’t forget to take your cameras .
"September 13, 2019",3.0,Beautiful but littered.,"It's such a shame to see such a wonderful part of the world covered in plastic bottles, rab ends and just piles of litter. Think about what you leave around when you leave or places like this will drown under the sh1te you leave behind."
"September 13, 2019",4.0,Very popular place to visit,"Absolutely worth a visit as is the surrounding area. Lots of bathing freely available but honestly disappointed in the quality of the sand. But it is sandy, only dark."
"September 12, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Picturesque, relaxing, clean and lovely to explore. Not advised for anyone with walking difficulties."
"September 12, 2019",3.0,Way too small,"Although the place itself looks nice, you can barely find free sunbeds or areas to put your towel down. All that in September. I'd suggest avoiding it in season."
"September 12, 2019",5.0,Romantic Beach,"Have visited the beach on the 20th of August. We wanted to swim but due to cold wind from the Alps the water was ice cold. The naming of Channel of Love comes from the tradition that all couples swimming there remain in love forever. Access to the Channel of Love is easy, by car you can get very close to the beach. Many tourists were already there when we arrived, therefore it is wise to get there early in the morning in order to find some space and you must also be very patient because it is very crowded. Definitely suggested."
"September 11, 2019",5.0,Evening Visit,Decided to visit early evening . Glad we did as virtually deserted . Lovely picturesque inlet . Worth a look .
"September 11, 2019",5.0,beautiful,"this is a beautiful area to come and explore, views are spectacular especially if you come to watch the sunset. Lots of beach bars surrounding it which let you use their sunbeds for free, or you can use the ones on the beach and there are a few private alcoves to. sea is blue and lots of people able to dive from some good heights. def worth a walk up both sides of it"
"September 11, 2019",5.0,Amazing swimming and diving area,A beautiful place. You must visit . It's a traditional Greek swimming hole with many historic myths of fertility and live when you swim here.
"September 10, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Just like the name this place is a real love. Its such a beautiful sea and nature. Easy to find peace and relax.
"September 10, 2019",5.0,Canal d'amour,"I nice little beach, great tarrace, beautifull view, lovely to swimm through the canal a nice place for a day at the beach"
"September 10, 2019",5.0,A Must See Beach,"After twisting and turning through the mountainside, one arrives.  If you are driving by car, follow google maps directions to the end point. We were lucky to find a few open parking spots.  The beach is much smaller than the photos portray but intimate indeed. Beautiful spot to take photos."
"September 9, 2019",3.0,Interesting but crowded,"It is an interesting piece of nature to see, but there are so many people, buildings and restaurants that it is an absolute chaos. I'm ok that we saw it but I don't really recommend the place. If you go be sure to swim through the little cave. It was interesting."
"September 8, 2019",4.0,Cool,Cool place for few hours by the seaside. The place is quite famous so it's almost always crowded. Nice view all around and clean water!
"September 8, 2019",2.0,Interesting but Overrated,One of the most overrated tourist attractions in Corfu. A V shaped canal ending in a narrow crowded beach. Didn't get to test the superstition though. They say that couples that kiss in the love canal will get married in a years turn :)
"September 8, 2019",4.0,Slightly disappointed,Had a rather over-priced and very disappointing Greek salad overlooking the bay - beautiful view though although it felt a little too commercialised for me.
"September 8, 2019",4.0,Nicr beach,It is a very nice beach with very good spots to jump from a high place. The disadvantage is that the places for putting your beach towel are not that good because you do not have sand. The main beach it is only for clients of a restaurant nearby.
"September 8, 2019",1.0,"Boom boxes, crowded, cloudy water, litter everywhere","If you have a car, skip this beach and ignore positive reviews. You walk past 6 stinking garbage dumpsters to get to the beach and pass kids with boom boxes going to and from the beach on your way. That should be warning enough. Beach is small and crowded and water cloudy. Can’t see the appeal on an island that has so much more to offer."
"September 7, 2019",3.0,Pretty,Pathways need renewing as dangerous especially for young children - no safety.  Views are beautiful. Some lovely restaurants overlooking sea and views.
"September 7, 2019",1.0,Swimming amongst the litter - canal de poubelle,"Similar to my review of the Sidari area, the Canal d'amour area needs a major clean up. The photos I have seen do not represent the reality, that this area is very polluted and leaking litter into the ocean. We went expecting to swim, but I didn't want to because of all the litter and the stinking stagnant river nearby. I understand that tourists are likely the cause of the problem, but tourists can be encouraged to leave areas clean if there are rubbish bins available but also obviously emptied, and if the litter is removed (as per broken windows theory). The council really needs to clean it up, or the local proprietors should take it upon themselves to improve the canal area and the main beach. The beaches are their business partners. If things do not improve I think the tourists will stop coming and the businesses will lose their livelihoods."
"September 7, 2019",5.0,Wow,"This is the best beach in sidari, clear waters, clay rocks and very warm! It is a little bit of a walk from main sidari but it is totally worth it!"
"September 6, 2019",1.0,Avoid,"Drove over from the other end of Sidari. Parking we found was 10 Euros! Husband drove back out and we parked some way away for free and walked in. The approach to the beach is cheap and tacky imo. I kept saying the beach would be lovely but when we got there and saw the packed out beach with no space (far too many loungers), we turned around and left. It looked awful, ugly and tacky and you couldn't pay me to stay there. We headed to the other end of Sidari and a lovely time on a beautiful, quiet, spacious beach! My advice... avoid Canal d'Amour end of Sidari."
"September 6, 2019",3.0,Busy and chavy,"Arrived and it was already heaving, overcrowded with loud people .  Recommend attending early for a swim or not at all . Many nicer spots"
"September 6, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place to visit and take pictures .,"When we googled Sidari and found this gem we just knew we had to visit it.  The scenery is beautiful, the water is incredibly blue. They also did a good job in setting up a pathway so that you are able to walk around and enjoy the scenery.  There are also pathways on top of the rocks so you can take kick-ass photos.  Not recommended to wear slippers (it's slippery) go for sandals.  What really bummed me up is the fact that the forestry on top of the rocks it was full of plastic bottles... that kind of triggered me a bit."
"September 4, 2019",5.0,great place to swim but be careful its hard getting back out,"great beach but buy a float as its hard getting out once you have swam round the rock... theres a rope but please only go with a strong swimmer , beautiful setting and loved watching the brace 1s just in off the rocks.. again please be careful"
"September 3, 2019",5.0,Beautiful day out!,"Spent the whole day out in the lovely beach of Canal D’amour. In the morning able to swim around the beach and take out a pedalo for 10 euros per hour. The restaurants have a lovely swimming pool, bar, tables, sun beds and kind people. Able to have lovely seafood lunch and walk around the little shops of Sidari. Have a lovely entertaining evening with dancing and singing at the restaurant with three main course for 20 euros per person depending on the event. Definitely recommend for family, friends and couples."
"September 3, 2019",4.0,Beautiful and worth a visit,"We were staying at the hotel right on the Canal D’Amour, so it was like a minute walk from us. We visited a few times during our holiday and it is very pretty. Great place to take photos, but it can get busy. The actual beach part is not great, and is very small and full of sun beds that you have to pay for. I went into the sea and swam into the cave type things and it was really lovely. Quite warm once you’re in there."
"September 2, 2019",5.0,Great for beach holiday,"Lovely clean warm sea, stays shallow quite far out so can swim to rocks out at sea, different little coves. Took the sunset cruise fantastic views of the cliffs. Plenty of beach bars with lovely views."
"September 1, 2019",4.0,Stunning coves caves,"Beautiful breathe taken views we went on the Pedro so we could explore €10 for an hour , 2 restaurants very near I recommend Aquarius lovely food drinks, definitely worth visiting."
"September 1, 2019",4.0,Kinda cool,"First impressions were not that well. The beach is big and sandy, which is nice, but the water is pretty shallow long way and full of sea grass and little stones. There are some pretty cool rocks on which you can climb, sit and enjoy the waves. Could be interesting if you like diving, but it's really not my type. When it comes to the Canal D'Amour it's a different story. Great for jumping into the water and the view is amazing. There is a solid rock you can climb on. It's nice for couples and those who travel alone or with friends, but not very good for little children because of the height."
"August 31, 2019",4.0,Great fun!,"Went for a day trip to Sidari from nearby Roda, after reading reviews we opted to take the green bus from Roda town which cost €7.60 and took about 30mins!! The town has many restaurants, clubs and souvenir shops. The canal d’amour is beautiful if your a swimmer and our kids loved the opportunity to cliff jump.theres a remote large rock out about 50m which is ideal to swim to and jump off and a large rock just a bit further that’s just out the water so you can swim out and sit on it and enjoy the view. When we arrived here there’s plenty of sun beds to use but there owned by hotels who charge €5 per person but you can use all there facilities which is pretty good. Overall it’s a lovely place to visit and a worthy day out! Or place to holiday. Bad points were the bus didn’t return with enough seats then the next one 10 mins after also had the same problem and the one 11/2 hrs later also didn’t arrive! So taxi it was HaHa joke that is as it also took 45mins to get one after numerous phone calls!! So if going to Sidari for a day be warned!!"
"August 30, 2019",5.0,Dive in and relax,"Traveling alone so visited this place after a few locals said it's a beautiful place, they were right. It's relaxing to go to even when it's busy it's not a loud or congested busy it's just people enjoying themselves and the view."
"August 30, 2019",5.0,Great Place to be at,"This is Really Postcard picturesque !!! We Swam in the Sea & it was Great Wish i was There Right Now !! If you Go to Sidari, You Must Go to this Little Gem of a Beach, Wow !!"
"August 29, 2019",4.0,Nice beach,Pictures make it look better than it really is. The sea is not Turquoise blue as they suggest. Still a nice beach though with small inlets and ledges the less adventurous of us to jump from
"August 29, 2019",4.0,Perfect sunset swim,"We arrived after most people had left for the day.. absolutely gorgeous! Parking is tricky, but free if you use the tavernas. Best to swim round and from the Albania side back in!"
"August 29, 2019",4.0,Great beach but very busy,Lovely views and great water but I would suggest getting there early as it does get very busy.  If you have kids I would suggest you also get there early as there is not much beach here and I am sure you would not want them sunbathing on the cliff side
"August 29, 2019",2.0,Too busy,Small beach reached by walking over a bridge over stagnant stinking water full of rubbish. Could barely see the beach or rocks as it was so packed with sun beds and umbrellas. Wouldn’t visit again.
"August 26, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place,"Fabulous place, stunning scenery! Well worth taking a boat trip as seeing it from the coast is amazing!"
"August 25, 2019",5.0,Canal D' Amour,"Lovely view, nice cove to go snorkelling from. Can get very busy during the day as a major sightseeing spot for tourist."
"August 23, 2019",5.0,Beautiful scenic place to visit,"We have walked into canal d'amour twice so far and it is beautiful. A short walk from our hotel in sidari. The restaurants are great. If you buy a drink or food you from them, you can use your sunbeds and pools free. It is beautiful and a great place to go and chill."
"August 22, 2019",5.0,Fabulous view,"Didnt really swim here as quite crowded. Fab photos taken. Easy to get to and from, bar nearby to get a few moments out of the sun."
"August 21, 2019",5.0,Day at the beach,Lovely place to visit and the kids enjoyed climbing all over the rocks and taking lots of selfies with all the different rock behind them! Defiantly worth a visit.
"August 20, 2019",5.0,Fabulous,Fabulous beaches for swimming cliff jumping. Great restaurants to eat at with sun loungers for the daytime free of charge if you purchase a drink Lovely sunsets in the evening
"August 20, 2019",5.0,Amazing caves,"This is a must visit place when you are staying in Sidari, Corfu. If you go there in the evening at around 8pm you can watch the amazing sunset. During the day, there are a few different coves with beaches with crystal clear water, rock faces to each side and you can swim out easily out of the coves and round into caves. All the beaches have sun beds, umbrellas, but not sure as to the set up for all the beaches. Some may charge & some may let you use them for free, as long as you buy drinks etc."
"August 19, 2019",3.0,Not impressed really,"I think the hype works against this place and it may be that its better form a boat but its a bit of a dissappointing walk in, the canal feeding it is dirty and smells of toilet and there was a lot of litter in the water. The sea part looks nice and its nice at night when its lit up but a bit overrated i thinkthis looks very average."
"August 18, 2019",4.0,Lovely scenery,Kids loved jumping off the rocks into the water. The climb back up is a bit tricky though! A rope ladder would be a great addition. Views lovely and plenty of restaurants and sun beds close by.
"August 17, 2019",1.0,An overrated piece of tourist garbage,"We have visisted the Canal D’Amour promised a beautiful quiet place with clear water and an astonishing view . Instead What we got was an overrated small cliff (one of the smallest ones at that. If you want to see a beautiful beach with cliffs visit the Long Beach) near giant hotels. The view was... average. The cliff was small and honestly nothing special compared to places like the previously mentioned Long Beach. Not only that, but the water was mostly dirty. Perhaps the place is apears pretty if you go there by boat, but if you did not- you cannot even swim there! Overall I would not recommend visiting Canal D’Amour as it is an overrated and unpleasant place"
"August 17, 2019",4.0,Clean place,"Lovely clean place, there is a lot of bars restaurants and cafes around. Nice place to take photos and chill out."
"August 17, 2019",5.0,A must see,A nice place where you may spend about 30 minutes.You will see the amazing shapes the see crafted from the cliffs.
"August 16, 2019",5.0,Nice place,Excellent and clean place to visit plenty of bars and beaches and free sun beds Great in the day and at night
"August 15, 2019",4.0,Rocks,Checked out location a few times wanting to take advantage of jumping into the sea. On a couple of occasions the exit point looked a bit dicey with people being washed off steps leading from the sea. So decision made check out swimming back round to Sidari beach which was pretty straightforward. So now to the jump son went straight for it I however had a long think about it before taking the plunge. Exit straightforward up steps cut into rocks the up onto top & yes jump again. Good fun. The coves are great. Locals say to be careful & check what’s beneath the water before jumping
"August 13, 2019",5.0,Hreat trip,Brilliant. Very beautiful im glad i went there! Fantastic views and food. It was on my list tp go amd see it.and i was mpre than happu to actually see it live! Please go and see it. Loved it
"August 12, 2019",5.0,beautiful views,Went to Canal D'Amour with my family and what a place to see.. a certain must see! we spent the day in the restaurant/cafe that over looks the sea which if you stay there and purchase your drinks and food you can park and lay on thier loungers for free. They have thier own pool and very clean facilities. They have thier own private beech too! You can take a stroll across the edge of the island with plenty of spectacular views... and if your gutsy many were junping off the cliffs into the sea! Must see!!!
"August 11, 2019",5.0,Mr and Mrs Burton,"What an amazing place, it has everything to offer, great restaurants, bars and hotels for great food and drinks. The scenery is breathtaking and the sea is to die for. You can do many water sports and boat trips all priced very reasonably. Not to be missed."
"August 11, 2019",1.0,what a deception!,"The Corfu Island guides recommended this visit and after several trips to the beautiful Corfu beaches, city and cosy corners we were expecting something similar. However it looks as a bar with paella and plenty of beers. I didn't even was suggested to take a photo, more people than drops of sea water"
"August 10, 2019",5.0,Very pretty,Lots of beautiful restaurants and lovely views Ate here a few times Although shame about the smelly bridge But don't let that put you of
"August 10, 2019",5.0,Awesome,Awesome place . We stay like 10 hours there and the rock are beautifull. The resorts are super nice from what we saw there. And the canal have a nice view.
"August 8, 2019",4.0,Deserved to be seen,There are many lovely spots in there that deserve a memorable picture. Unfortunately not enough room for everyone as the beach is quite small.
"August 8, 2019",5.0,Stunning location,"Take a walk around the rocks from the main beach in Sidari, you will come to several small coves where you can sit on the beach or swim in the clear blue waters. The canal is particularly stunning, with caves to swim through and a stunning view."
"August 6, 2019",5.0,Great beach,"Beautiful beaches recommended! A cliff that is relatively safe to jump from, that also has a rope from which you can get up again. Beach bars restaurants and shops all around for every taste."
"August 6, 2019",4.0,Pretty Coastline,"The canal and coastline are very pretty, with a lovely cove. The canal is also lovely and a great place to swim and BASE jump into the water. The nearby town is a little like Blackpool - full of hotels, souvenir shops and restaurants. Great place to visit but not sure I would want to stay there for a holiday."
"August 6, 2019",5.0,Stunning!,A beautiful stunning area of corfu.. The stunning views of the turquoise sea surrounding the cliffs is a must.
"August 5, 2019",5.0,Lovely natural rock formation,"Interesting and unique rock formation but far too crowded in high season, waters in the area are quite murky as too is the shallow adjoining beach due to being overpopulated in the busy months, otherwise lovely place."
"August 4, 2019",2.0,Ruined by a massive hotel and ridiculous crowds,"The most striking view in Corfu that is talked up in all the day trips has been ruined with a massive hotel on top, covered in sun beds, rammed with pedaloes, and thronging with jeering crowds urging each other to jump off the rocks. Such a shame that it’s treated so poorly. They really spoiled this natural beauty spot."
"August 4, 2019",5.0,great views,"Great views, there is a little cove were you can have a clay body mask for free, your skin will feel so good after washing it off. If you look at the rocks you will see a gray line, just wet with sea water and rub the gray strip,the clay will then be easy for you to rub all over your skin!!"
"August 4, 2019",4.0,"Nice beaches, great views, but too many people","This is well known tourist attraction, so you have to go there early or off-season. These beautiful views are really magical and romantic. There are sandy beaches and nice sea. You can pay for sunbeds or you can stay on the rocks for free. It's up to you."
"August 4, 2019",3.0,Beautifull place but too full of tourists,"The canal is located in the middle of a very touristic village. In fact it is at the back yard of hotels. The canal is full of sun loungers and many tourists jumping to water etc. If you want to enjoy the beauty, come here early in the morning!"
"August 3, 2019",5.0,Lovely place,Certainly worth a short walk from the main strip to see this. Great views and some really nice beaches.
"August 2, 2019",3.0,Beautiful place but ......,"This is a beautiful place but good luck finding a sun bed ! The sun beds take up most of the space but fill up quickly, very picturesque setting though."
"August 2, 2019",4.0,Lovely if you pick your time!,"A great place to visit if you’re in the area. We stayed at Akron seascape that was on the doorstep so visited here a few times. If you visit earlier morning or late evening the scenery is lovely with great photo opportunities, however middays and early evening it gets you packed."
"July 31, 2019",1.0,Canal d' Odour,"Stinks to high heaven, I'm no forensic expert but I trust my nose and know the stink of raw sewage when it hits me."
"July 30, 2019",4.0,Nice view,"Canal was our last stop during trip along north-west coast. Whole area around Canal is private, I had impression, that we were walking through Hotel area to get there. Rocks and small bays looks very nice, whole place is surely scenic and worth at least short visit. You can jump into water or just swim surrounded by walls of Canal, which is interesting experience. Because of large number of people and noise, after short swimming and taking some photos, we went further."
"July 28, 2019",4.0,Pictureque,"Nice place to visit with nice beaches either side. If you are gutsy enough try jumping in to the channel, the hard part is climbing out. Suitable for all ages, couples, groups and families. The usual traditional Greek taverns, all of a good standard serving good food and very reasonably priced. Just returned after 1 week stay with friends, enjoyed evet minute."
"July 28, 2019",1.0,Tired ... come on Sidari clean it up !,"With so many tourists to the area you would think the local hotels and restaurants would want to look after this attraction.  No... filthy with overflowing litter bins, broken pathways and overgrown bushes.  Come on residents and business or Sidari sort it out !"
"July 28, 2019",4.0,In parts very beautiful,"Part of the Sidari resort of Corfu, the quieter end. Some lovely hotels right in the canal edge and a lot of basic rooms to rent. Although the area is beautiful looking out to sea, the main street is looking a little run down. There is a major problem with refuse on Corfu as the landfill is full and it can sit in the street for days and attracts vermin and cats. If you have always stayed in basic, value for money rooms, you will find a lot have not been updated in a while and some even not maintained. In general, I think unless a mass effort is made by owners to tidy up and maintain, people will choose other areas. It still is a friendly island with good tavernas to be found."
"July 27, 2019",5.0,Picturesque and beautiful,"Stunning place, well worth a trip to even if you are not staying in Sidari. Try and visit at sunset - one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen!"

"July 27, 2019",5.0,Breathtaking,"One of the most beautiful places on earth. If you go to Corfu, you have to swim in its canals. It is a must."
"July 27, 2019",4.0,Drunk teenagers,It was beautifull but full with drunk tourists. They literally can broke your time there. If u like to snorkeling don't go there. Never the less you should visit the beach.
"July 26, 2019",5.0,30 years and still coming back.,"A long time visitor here and what can you say..... lovely. Plenty of family Tavern's , Cafe's for light snacks /main meals. Lovely safe beaches with easy access...Great views.."
"July 26, 2019",5.0,Stop at Taverna Canal D'Amour,"As you walk onto the end part of the main sidari beach , towards the cliffs and the Canal , there is a bar with great sunbeds & pool just on the beach . The Taverna has shade under a wonderful tree and an excellent menu . Pay 10 Euro for a sunbed & brolly and they give you 10 Euro credit in the bar and restaurant .... Free sunbed . Use of their toilet and pool is also allowed . We used this for 3 days and enjoyed evry visit . Use this as your base to explore the Canal and the cliff walks or pedalos and boats ."
"July 26, 2019",4.0,Lovely area shame about the litter.,"A really fantastic place to catch the sunset and take in the views, somewhat spoilt by lazy visitors not taking their rubbish away."
"July 26, 2019",3.0,Very nice but super-crowded,"Not a single bad thing to put on the location, it is clean and stunning. We went in PEAK-week though and the place was VERY crowded."

"July 22, 2019",4.0,Boat visit,We took a boat here from Arillas and saw this from the water perspective. It was fun to watch all the people jumping off the cliffs nearby.
"July 21, 2019",5.0,A Must Experience!,This was a fun place to swim and hang out. They do charge for the sun beds but we opted not to pay and just put our stuff on the rocks and enjoyed the space anyway. We swam out through the canal. The waters were so beautifully green and blue swimming back and there’s a shelf inside where you can get out and walk around the cave or sit for a few minutes. Overall fun and great experience.
"July 21, 2019",5.0,Stunning,"Stuning location. Full of natural beauty, very rustic and takes your breath away. Well worth a visit."
"July 19, 2019",5.0,Nice formation,"It was an interesting place to visit ,we spent there about an hour mainly for taking photos because we visited in the evening.Some people were still swimming."
"July 18, 2019",3.0,Over crowded and a lot of seaweed,Not up to expectation the sea seemed very murky and the beach was overcrowded with sunbeds. The rubbish tips near by did not enhance my experience.
"July 17, 2019",5.0,fantastic waves in the wind,One of the best place in Corfu Island; if are some wind it is more spectacular; must be seen and walk around; real beach life and feeling
"July 16, 2019",5.0,Aberdeen Couple,"A lovely view and the sunset is ace - spend the day there, swim in the sea and swim through the Love Tunnel - Try the resturant at the very top of the path - Kahula it's brill with very good friendly staff - have a drink at the bar in the complex all staff are very friendly. A great day adventure."
"July 16, 2019",4.0,Gorgeous view,"Nature has made its job - you can admire beautiful view, but you will meet a lot of people there as well."
"July 15, 2019",5.0,Lovely area of natural beauty,"Stayed in Sidari so a nice stroll to this area. Lots of bars and restaurants too. Explored in the evening a few times, watching the sun go down. Nice place to wonder around. Lovely colours. Went in the day to swim through the canal and explore the cave. Great experience! A must thing to do if in the area."
"July 14, 2019",4.0,Half an hour of something different to see,"Well, it’s free and a bit different. Quite a windy and rough day when we were there but that made it more interesting. Not a destination in itself, but good when also visiting Longas Beach if you’ve got a car"
"July 14, 2019",3.0,Lovely Views,"Came here to see the views and the lovely bay. Was a very hot day and looked so tmpting to take the plunge and jump in however after seeing one girl do it and unable to get back out without the assistance of 3 folk I decided against it. Worth a visit to see the place however, as like the rest of Sidari, over commercialised. Had some drinks in the local bar and enjoyed the lovely surroundings. Been there, however having done it, in hindsight wouldnt have been too disappointed if we never had the time to go."
"July 14, 2019",5.0,Wonderful views,"An area of breathtaking beauty, and was well worth the short walk from the beach. I was on my own, but felt like a romantic spot to visit"
"July 14, 2019",5.0,Sunset!,"We stayed in the centre of Sidari so this was only a 15min walk away. It was so beautiful we came back multiple times over our week stay, it looks amazing at sunset!"
"July 12, 2019",5.0,beautiful,what a beautiful part of Sidari the actual resort is like Blackpool but behind it all is this hidden gem stunning views beach side bars and restaurants to idle the sunny days away.
"July 11, 2019",5.0,Amazing sea,Arround the Canal d’Amour is an beautiful sea ...so clean ! Just have a look at my photos. I spent here amazing day.
"July 10, 2019",5.0,Absolutely stunning SUNRISE!,"If you want to experience something really beautiful and deep, wake up early and visit the canal before the sunrise and watch how the day wakes up. There are no people in the morning so the views plus water splashes and birds singing make it a surreal exprience.  At the same time i guess that in the afternoon it’s an absolutely different place with the crowds of tourists, high temperatures and the harsh light."
"July 9, 2019",5.0,Out of this world,An amazing place to visit Clean and tidy Clear water and a great place to jump into the sea and swim Would return in a heartbeat
"July 7, 2019",5.0,Pool and Canal,"We visited Sidari, and on the whole, it was lovely to visit for the day - we could probably do two days at a push but as a Brit, I do my upmost to stay away from expats on holiday (sorry not sorry) it is a nice area, there’s a few hidden gems inside the town although there is a few Brit bars en route to the canal and on the main strip, which we avoided and preferred to go to a taverna or beach bar.  We did find a bar/pool bar located right next to the canal which featured a pool and shower, so if you went in the sea you could wash off the sand and dip in and treat yourself to a cocktail on a sun lounger while basking in the Greek sun."
"July 7, 2019",5.0,great place and wonderfull water,lovely water but the bay is little so be there early if you want to find car park and space on the beach
"July 6, 2019",4.0,Better in the photos,"The beach it s small and it has some sunbeds for 8euro/2. It s kinda crowded, it is worth visiting for a quick bath, but not spending a hole day here."
"July 6, 2019",4.0,Beautiful Scenery,This was off the beaten track so to speak but it was a nice surprise to find. The views was brilliant. Not taking away from canal d’amour the only thing that annoyed me was the skips of over flowing rubbish in sidari itself and at the entrance to this beauty spot . It really has so much potential but this litter problem needs sorting.
"July 5, 2019",5.0,Very beautiful,Evening sunsets were fabulous. There are a number of bars to enjoy the sunset or just sit on thd rocks to enjoy the views which are beautiful.
"July 4, 2019",2.0,Disappointed,Was hoping for a really special unique place that you could not find anywhere else . It’s ok but if I was not actually staying in Sidari I wouldn’t have bothered going . It’s not like the cliffs are particularly high or the sea is crystal clear or the near by beach is really beautiful. It’s just ok to take a look if your nearby .
"July 4, 2019",5.0,Pretty,Lovely coves and small beaches. Fantastic restaurants to enjoy a seafront view and drinks. You can walk along the pathway and climb onto the rocks. Sidari jetty run short boat trips around theCanal D'Amour for about 40 mins or so.
"July 3, 2019",4.0,Lovely place,Just a perfect place beautiful setting beach not so good but views and clear blue water and so warm.
"July 2, 2019",5.0,A beautiful hidden cove. Fantastic sunset.,The water is so clear and the sand so white it is just a beautiful place. We visited to watch the sun set and it was fantastic. There were loads of other people there all fixated on watching the sun go down and all the wonderful colours that lot the sky before slowly disappearing. The cove is enclosed by layers of cliffs and ledges and people can jump off the cliff ledges into the water and then swim back to the sand. There are small caves that you can swim under and the place is well worth a visit. We were lucky enough to be staying at the Akron Seascapes Resort situated on the cliff above the beach so felt spoilt by having this view all week. There are limited sunloungers on the beach so it's worth making an early start. Parking is just inside the hotel entrance and is at a premium so again an early start is advantageous.
"July 2, 2019",1.0,Not that great,"Save your time and effort to go there 🙄 Was absolutely waste of time to drive to the north, very chaotic city and the canal was very crowded and had dirty water."
"July 1, 2019",4.0,Perfect for Sunday morning Breakfast,"We drove over here around 8:30AM on a Sunday. This was the perfect time to see the beach and canal without a crowd. Breakfast was also delightful and inexpensive, less than €8 for a “Greek Breakfast”"
"July 1, 2019",5.0,Fantastic view,Beautifull views on the cliff. Not far from main city street. I think the most beautifull place around Sidari
"June 30, 2019",5.0,Beautiful place!,"Well it’s definitely a must-see if you are on the island. It’s very picturesque and the legend around it is very sweet ❤️ I’d say it’s great for all types of travelers- couples, friends and familied with kids. The water is a bit cold though (or at lest it was when I was there)"

"June 28, 2019",5.0,Beautiful & Private,"Corfu canal d amore is intertwined with Sidari rocks so essentially the same place. My husband and I drove in from the city and surprised to see everything closed from restaurants and bars to hotels while we were there in November, clearly the off season. We knew it would be too cold to get in the water at this time of the year but would still recommend the visit as the views are beautiful and very private with no other tourist at this time of year. My only recommendation would be to pack a picnic lunch, otherwise you will be very hungry until you are back in the city."
"June 28, 2019",5.0,Wonderful place for the swimming,Sidari is very beautiful place with many shops.Canal d’amour is the best place and most beautiful for the swimming.I adore this place and enjoy my swimming.
"June 24, 2019",5.0,Great little beach,"Lovely little beach at the back of our hotel “Akron seascape resort” can go walking over the rocks, cliff and there’s access down to the beach and sea. Can swim up to the little cave too"
"June 22, 2019",5.0,Very pretty,"It’s pretty busy, but well worth the visit, as the place is beautiful and the views are stunning. There is a small beach which looked brilliant for families with young children, but it would get busy quickly, so I’d advise arriving early. We walked from sidari and there are plenty of cliff bars and places to eat with views from the cliffs"
"June 20, 2019",5.0,Perfect.,"The apartments are perfectly adequate self catering apartments that are well serviced, clean and roomy. The complex though is in the perfect position, it is at the centre of everything. Classy old tavernas, 50 yards away, fantastic beach, 50 yards away, great pools, 50 yards away, shops, bank machine, bars..yes 50 yards away. If you wanted to go down the main street in Sidari thats about a 20 minute stroll, and that is perfect, because it means you can get peace and quiet here also. The staff cannot do enough for you, the pool bar/cafe perfectly adequate and reasonably priced...I could go on and on, I was here with my wife the first two weeks of June and I will definitely be returning again and again."
"June 20, 2019",5.0,To visit old friends,"Had a meal in restaurant and see old friends ,we’ve not been in 10 years and they still remembered us all as we went as a group of 6 .It is still as beautiful as we remembered at canal da mour"
"June 19, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,A lovely location on a warm sunny day and easily accessible. Several tavernas at the location where you could enjoy a drink or meal and enjoy the view.
"June 19, 2019",5.0,Sunset,"Beautiful place to visit. The sunset is beautiful, amazing views, nice places to eat and have a drink."
"June 19, 2019",4.0,A “must see” near Sidari,Wonderful sandstone cove with small beach and refreshing deep water bathing. Gets fairly busy but plenty of parking nearby. I’d recommend taking the coastal footpath at the end of Sidari beach as this is much prettier than the direct walk along the road.
"June 19, 2019",1.0,Bit of a dump!,"Visited last week whilst here in Sidari, didn’t think much of it at all. Beach had litter & rubbish floating at the shore edge, not very inspiring at all. I really don’t think it’s a pretty place!"
"June 18, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,Absolutely stunning and beautiful views. You can get down on to a small beach one side and swim under the cave that is called the tunnel of love. If your tall enough you can almost walk out to it. You can walk up the rocks and see some stunning views although it is quite dangerous and you need to be careful under foot. Not good if you don't have very good use of your legs. You can walk over the other side to a few nice restaurants but can still get access to them from the road side and see the stunning views. There are no barriers to stop you falling over the end of the cliffs just need your wits about you. Definitely worth a visit.
"June 18, 2019",5.0,Holiday,The canal d'amour is stunning if u get chance swim under the tunnel off love the sea is crystal clear
"June 18, 2019",5.0,Honeymoon 2019,"This was a beautiful destination for our honeymoon, the scenery was just outstanding. The perfect place for newlyweds and couples ❤"
"June 17, 2019",3.0,Ok place,The name of the place is given from a small channel that binds the bathing bay with open sea. In the channel there are a ledge where you can sit and scribble your love notes on the wall. A bit overhyped all in all since the beach is small with little space for sunbathing
"June 17, 2019",5.0,Lovely setting,Hired a boat to come here by the sea. You can walk to it by land. Caves you can swim through. Cliffs you can jump off into the sea. Also big rocks further along you can dive sunbathe on.
"June 16, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Love a walk down to the canal. Stunning scenery,fabulous bars and restaurants. Always takes your breath away"
"June 16, 2019",5.0,Cool place!!,"As the title says its cool water is actually the perfect place to dive. Its far from the main town kerkyra , if you stay north is easy to visit. It was worth to see that place. Is better to park your car in Sidari 11 minutes away on foot rather than there because its difficult to find a place, go early in the morning if you want to park near the beach."
"June 16, 2019",5.0,Scenic Place with Interesting Rock Formations,"A very interesting and scenic place to visit for good photo opportunities due to the unusual rock formations. There's actually two Canal d'Amour's (the main one and a smaller one) which are right next to each other. If you are staying in or near Sidari, this is definitely worth a visit."
"June 15, 2019",5.0,Lovely stop off,We were touring the Northern Tip of Corfu and were receommended to stop off here and find the location of the Canal D'amour. Glad we did. Tucked off the main road from Sidari is this little treasure. Sadly getting a bit too commercialised but well worth a stop
"June 15, 2019",4.0,Beautiful spot,Its worth the short walkon the paved pathway from Sidari to Canal D'Amour beach. Great rocks carved by the sea. A bench in the shade with Jasmine and bourgainvilleas . There are 3 beaches with shallow water to paddle or swim. The restaurants provide sunbeds in the hope of your custom but there is plenty of sand for your towel. Or sandcastle.
"June 13, 2019",5.0,Vivian,"Love this place, amazing scenery with lots of sea view restaurants around, the sea was clear with golden sand there are some walk way around the canal to get to cliffs and sea. Love this place"
"June 12, 2019",4.0,Great Place,"We went up to this place a few times whilst we were in Sidari and it has great views several bar/restaurants to keep you entertained each place we visited we found the staff,food,and drinks all top drawer with excellent service very attentive indeed. Please bare in mind if you have walking problems you my find some area's hard to reach but to be fair all try their very best to accommodate all comer's. It is a must see place if your in or around the resort of Sidari."
"June 10, 2019",5.0,Beautiful beach,This beach is very beautiful with magnificent rock formations. The area is also a walkers paradise. It’s not suitable for people with physical impairment due to the steep access.
"June 9, 2019",5.0,beautiful,"what ever you do don't leave Sidari without taking a walk up the side of the canal d,amour. beautiful scenery and clear blue seas."
"June 7, 2019",4.0,Beautiful location,"We were lucky enough to stay overlooking the Canal D’Amour, it is a beautiful sight that is a must see if you are in the area. It does get quite busy at peak times. A good spot to watch the sunset."
"June 7, 2019",2.0,Wasted walk,"Felt disappointed having walked from the opposite end of sidari. The beach at canal damour is barely accessible, no sunbeds, seaweed ridden beach, left disappointed"
"June 6, 2019",4.0,Hidden gem,Really nice little beach. Spent an afternoon here in May with family. Water is shallow enough for kids to paddle in and for adults to walk quite far out too. Really picturesque and has a bar right next to it for refreshments and food which is reasonably priced too
"June 6, 2019",3.0,"Beautiful Palace, but needs investment to protect it","This is the second time we have visited the Palace, with a gap of around 11 years in between visits. While it is unquestionably beautiful it is now starting to show signs of neglect and the building needs some serious work to enable future visitors to continue to use it. On our last visit the statues were much cleaner but have been been left to the elements and are dirty and sad. The gardens are beautiful and the history is very interesting, this is enhanced by the audio guide which is available in several languages and will enhance your experience. Toilet facilities are very limited so expect a wait if it’s busy.  Entrance is reasonably priced and it makes a good stop off for an hour or two. Be aware that there is not a huge amount of parking available and that very large coaches use the roads so expect to have to give way or reverse.  Worth a visit if you are interested in history"
"June 5, 2019",1.0,Horibble,"The view,rocks and see in this point are wonderful. But the hotels,bars are to close to this treasute of natire and it spoils everything. Loud music,many drinking tourists, the full pools of the hotels surounding this place makes it the worst place in Corfu that we visited. The government shoudn't allow to bild hotels so near to this nature's pearl"
"June 5, 2019",5.0,Beautiful,"Beautiful place, different than others and worth having coffee break at least. One of top 3 places in corfu for us."
"June 4, 2019",5.0,Great views,We took a boat tour which was about 45 minutes and were happy about this decision as the views of the coast were really spectacular.
"June 3, 2019",3.0,"Nice, possibly slightly overrated","It's a lovely walk up and around the coastal path from Sidari to the Canal D'Amour - as for the Canal itself well... its nice and worth visiting but arguably a little overrated and not quite as good as the photos make it seem in my opinion.  Stil worth visiting, if ever so slightly underwhelming"
"June 3, 2019",2.0,Scruffy and congested,"Went to the Canal D'Amour, where there are three small bays that the sea comes into set against sandstone cliffs and relatively clear water. Very commercialised, and overdeveloped, felt more like a Benidorm feel to the whole place, heaving with burnt Brits mainly, either eating or sunbathing in and around the hotel pools and the myriad of cheap apartments overlooking the once beautiful secluded bays.We found the place quite 'pikey' and run down. However on a good note we did find a nice table overlooking one of the bays where the food was good (as is usual in Greece) and not too expensive. Local Tourist department need to get a grip here I feel as I can imagine it must have been beautiful once. i won't be returning personally not my cup of tea thanks."
"June 2, 2019",5.0,Great location,Canal D’Amour is the best side of Sidari and a really friendly part of Corfu. It is well worth the drive to the north of the island. Sidari we will be back.
"May 31, 2019",5.0,Stunning location,Second time here to Sidari. Every time we come here we visit Canal D’Amour. Breathtaking views and lovely place to walk around and spend the morning just watching the water hit to rocks.
"May 31, 2019",3.0,Dont go thinking that you are going to be amazed,"I don't know if it was due to the time of year (May) that we went. The beaches could be so much more inviting if they were cleaned up of rubbish and more importantly the seaweed covering a lot of the sand. For me Sidari just needs a general tidying up. We saw numerous bins overflowing with rubbish with loads on the floor. Even when the bins were emptied, the rubbish around it on the floor was just left. The water is clean and clear so if you like a dip in the sea its ok."
"May 30, 2019",1.0,Pretty Island shame about rubbish!,"There are some pretty spots around Sidari, this being one of them however with bins overflowing, it ruins the area."
"May 28, 2019",1.0,tiny alcove beach,"this is quite a nice alcove but the beach on it is tiny and the tide comes in quickly so watch out if your sun bathing and do'nt keep an eye on the sea, it may catch you by surprise."
"May 27, 2019",4.0,Great view,Although a small beach the walk is very pleasant. Be aware that there are a few scary paths and bridges that have no handrails.  When we were there the beach empty as the weather was not to good however the sea was very clear and blue.
"May 25, 2019",4.0,Well worth a visit if you are staying locally in Sidari,"Wear suitable footwear as some of the climbs are slippy plus you’ll get to enjoy the views. There is a very nice restaurant with special views to sit and people watch and chill out, very nice and worth a quick visit."
"May 21, 2019",4.0,Just away from the noise of the Strip,Far better to stay in the Canal D'Amour area unless you wish to party all night. Fabulous views of the cliffs coastline and sunset and plenty of good restaurants and bars without loud disco's although some venues to have entertainment on.
"May 19, 2019",3.0,Attractive geographical feature,"Head up to the NW coast to Sidari where you will find the Canal D'Amour Tunnel, about a 15-minute walk from town. You will have to go along some open resort properties and a few sketchy wood bridges to get there. Remarkable geographic feature that can be explored all the way up to some sheer cliffs on either side without any safety railings or warnings of sudden drops. The east side has the better views. The west side is a little hard to get to and the views are mostly blocked by vegetation. We spent about an hour there, if you include the 15 minute walk from town, where there is plenty of parking. We were practically the only ones there although I understand in the summer it is standing room only and a party atmosphere with all the pool bars surrounding it. Worth the trip if you happen to be in the area but would not make this a focus of your time on Corfu. Skip if pressed for time and definitely less attractive if rainy weather."
"May 18, 2019",5.0,"Fantastic, Amazing,Beautiful",I absolutely love this place it is amazing there is such an a beautiful veiw from the top and the bays are fantastic to swim in . You have to see it.
"May 16, 2019",5.0,Canal D'amour,A loverly spot to visit. Found in the north of Corfu Island at Siddari. It is a really good spot to get stunning pictures.  I highly recommend a visit.
"May 14, 2019",4.0,Worth a visit for a photo,A pretty spot for a short photo stop. It was quite hard to find the right access road as some entry points were via hotel property. One of the main bars with the same name does not give you a view of the actual tourist spot instead its just a small beach. We walked and eventually found it.
"May 12, 2019",4.0,Nice but not the best place in the island.,"Nice place for taking a few picture or eat dinner in nice scenery...but if you do not like crowded and typical touristic places with hotels and apartaments around, you should not spend there more than few hours. However, worth to be seen because of the pics."
"May 12, 2019",5.0,Stunning views! And lots of lizards!,The walk to canal d'amour (via the beach) from sidari is great!  Plenty of smaller canals to explore and we saw lots of wildlife including a few lizards! It's a fairly easy walk just the ground can sometimes be a little uneven.  Well worth the visit we went back for a second day of exploring this area as it was so beautiful!!
"May 12, 2019",5.0,Wonderful,This is amazing following a trail of rock and greenery up and up with some of the most beautiful scenery. A photographer's dream. Lots of tavernas on the way to stop and have a drink and something to eat . If going to sidari it is a must see place you won't be disappointed
"May 12, 2019",5.0,What a place,"We went for a all and found this place. It was marvellous, a path leading up and up over a massive rock formation which goes up and across with some of the most beautiful views possible several tavernas on the way to stop and stare. This is a must see place in sidari. Wonderful"
"May 11, 2019",3.0,"It’s lovely, can be busy, uneven paths","Parking is tricky, nice views and took the obligatory photos.  If you are unsteady on your feet then take care, especially at the top which has a shear drop with no warning or fence etc.  Just wasn’t for me, perhaps it had been oversold on how beautiful it was and my expectations were too high."
"May 10, 2019",5.0,Cliff diving for the brave of heart,Watch brave young men jump and dive off unusual rock formations. Easy to jump off the rocks & not so easy to get back out.
"May 9, 2019",5.0,Worth a visit,Stunning views amazing walks wataching people jump from the cliffs absolutely amazing place would definitely recommend a visit
"May 7, 2019",4.0,"Pretty but it's pretty all round the island, not just here","It's not necessary to come here to see this - it is pretty, but the whole island is lovely. Beautiful even if the weather isn't great, fairly peaceful but touristy and plenty to eat and drink 10 mins walk away, some restaurants even have seats on the beach, very close to canal d'amour."
"May 6, 2019",3.0,take a photo,Been there last spring the view is spectacular i don't know about the beach a lot of places to eat or have a drink or coffee
"April 23, 2019",5.0,Canal D’ Amour,"Maybe the best place on the island. With the long tiny sand beach full of tavernas with musics and every kind of different foods, salads greeks or any other. There is a plenty of apartments and if you like it you can stay fore some days.!!!"
"April 22, 2019",5.0,Great views,Nice place.great views.good beach bar and wicked seating made from pallets and hanging chairs.good service
"April 14, 2019",5.0,Holiday,Beautiful place worth a walk along the beach stopping for a cold drink and something to eat there is plenty of places to sun bath and to climb if you in to that on holiday
"February 21, 2019",5.0,Sidari beach,We visited sidari for the day its a long drive but its full of scenery ...it was a beautiful day so we visited beach its sandy and very beautiful place.
"February 20, 2019",5.0,"Canal D'Amour Sidari, Greece","Visited Canal D'Amour last August with my 2 sons and my ex husband on a day out while on holiday in Corfu. I swam the length of the canal backwards and forwards - it was like being in a mineral spa! The water was so clear, deep green, and the darkest night blue. I closed my eyes and wished, 'let me find my new true love' as I swam. Well, two months later I met my present partner in my local post office and we are very happy. So, you never know what could happen if you swim in this canal. It is a stunning place to visit. If you are brave enough, jump off the cliff not the water below. If not, just let yourself down into the water using the rope attached to a rock. Well worth the effort."
"February 10, 2019",5.0,B E A U T I F U L,"Lovely place to visit when in Corfu! It is located on the north side of the island! The rocky formations make the perfect scenery to dive in the blue waters, enjoy the natural beauty and the breathtaking view!"
"December 27, 2018",4.0,Lonely and stunning,We felt privileged to have come to canal d’amour in winter as we were the only visitors and had the beautiful views to ourselves. We drove in a rented car from the hotel as the city bus wasn’t operating this day. Unfortunately the restaurant was closed and the car park semi abandoned but otherwise the area was very relaxing and worth the trip.
"December 6, 2018",5.0,realy lovely natural diving area very fun for youngsters ;;;;,"it was a really diffrent experience to swim in such a beach front , amazing high spots for diving made my kids bring out the dare in them :;;unforgetable //"
"November 17, 2018",5.0,Be careful when climbing and taking selfies,"A major attraction not only for Corfu but also for Greece, this place is equally interesting to visit on foot and to watch from a boat. Be careful when climbing it and taking selfies, there have been many accidents with tourists falling into the sea from a height throughout the years."
"November 16, 2018",5.0,Enjoy and unwind,"The Canal D,About is on the edge of Ducati a place where you can just relax and unwind,plenty of walks,lovely beaches and some wonderful and inexpensive Taverns, l would say it's more for the middle aged and older generation. However if you want the disco bars and live music a 5minute walk will take you into the heart of Sidari, something for all."
"November 7, 2018",3.0,Good to see,Staying in Sidari it is an easy walk. Good to see. Many diving and jumping from this area. Plenty of places en route to eat or have a drink.
"November 7, 2018",3.0,First time in Sidari,"First time in Sidari and we loved it, can't wait to return next year. We explored the Canal D'Amour area a few times and went over to the cliff area and beach, however at the time of us being there it appeared there was a strike taking place with the refuse collection. This made the area very unpleasant to walk through. We ate at a lovely British pub, food was great. Definitely recommend"
"October 31, 2018",5.0,view to die for,This view is incredible it alone is well worth your stay here. We got this view from the hotel bar and enjoyed in morning and night while eating our meals
"October 31, 2018",5.0,Beautiful,Worth visiting and has stunning views and lovely places surrounding to eat and drink. We hired a pedalo which was for an hour. Definitely worth doing as great fun.

"October 25, 2018",5.0,Amazing Views!,"Honestly the most beautiful views of the sea and rocks. Me and my best friend heard many legends of this place, apparently if you meet somebody there, they'll be your one true love. The canal is supposed to be the ""canal of love"". It was definitely worth the visit. A lovely walk in the sun and some of the best restaurants, they really don't play when it comes to the food!"
"October 23, 2018",3.0,Better viewed from the sea,This is a little cove with a cave/tunnel. Legend say's if you swim it's length you will meet your one true love. It's hard to get near with all the youngsters jumping from the rocks.

"October 5, 2018",5.0,Beautiful and peaceful place!,"This was an amazing find, we has the sun blazing and it just light up the rocks making them look beautiful with the blue sea. We decided to climb some of the rocks and get to different heights and over look the beach and can see the country Albania from here as well. We will return before the end of her holiday with better footwear so we can explore more of the rocks , there is a rope which goes into the water which I'm guessing is for people who like to cliff jump into the sea but I'm not sure if it's safe to do so or not. Either way it's a beautiful spot."

"October 4, 2018",4.0,Romantic backdrop,"Visually everything it says in the brochure, however in October we had strong winds making the sea a bit uninviting, had to be there early to get a place on the beach. Ample bars restruants around to have a rest, coffee or a beer."
"October 3, 2018",5.0,Hoilday,Truly breathtaking. You will definitely need your camera for this piece of paradise. Fabulous beaches and amazing view. It's worth heading down in the evening too see the most amazing sunset and catch the warm sea breeze. My partner and I will definitely be returning next Sep.
"October 3, 2018",5.0,Beautiful local land mark,"We came here when the sea was rough and when it was calm, great place to be both times! Would recommend the shirt walk from sidari to see it!"
"October 3, 2018",2.0,BUSY BEYOND BELIEF,"Totally and utterly heaving. No room anywhere, on any of its beaches  Water looked particularly murky. Definitely not for us, perhaps because coming from the Gower, we have some of the world's best beaches on our doorstep. Therefore I wouldn't necessarily put anyone off from visiting  If like us you don't like it, then you can use the large swimming pool of the Zafiris hotel, provided you're buying drinks, as we did"
"October 3, 2018",5.0,A surprise.,"The Canal D'Amour is at the end of Sidari, a busy, lively resort. A surprise for such a resort. A must for people visiting Corfu."

"October 2, 2018",3.0,Morning visit,"Lovely views lovely little cove could get busy at peak seasons,very close to sidari walking distance."
"September 30, 2018",3.0,Average,"Was a little disappointed on visiting this location advised by many guides, the weather wasnt great for our visit so perhaps this was the cause. All around the location is built up including the area very close to it which detracts from the beauty and means parking and access is not easy to navigate. This would not be on my list of places which you must see on Corfu."
"September 30, 2018",3.0,Stunning area but let go. ?,A beautiful area of Sidari walking through the rock formations and following the tiny paths on the edge of cliffs it works so you have to pass through cafes and restaurants on the way with then stunning views out to see. ! I know they have political problems with refuge collection at this time but please don't let the area become shabby with small amounts of rubbish on view. (I picked some of it up as passing) Also the path through getting a little tricky in places ? apart from that a lovely place and worth a visit.
"September 29, 2018",4.0,Breath taking,"we walked up to have a look at canal D,Amour and its breath taking would recommend the hour long boat trip as this shows the other side and for ten euros not to be missed"
"September 29, 2018",5.0,Stunning,Everyone that visits sidari should have a walk and visit this beautiful place. We were lucky our hotel was actually on this beauty spot so we got to see it everday
"September 27, 2018",4.0,Beautiful spot - must see in Corfu Island,If going by bus you need to catch a green bus from the station in Corfu Town – follow the signs to it. The beach and rock scenery are amazing. You can use a sunbed so long as you buy something to eat / drink and at the time we went (mid Sept) it was not too busy. Not sure if there is enough happening in the area to warrant staying there as a base and it was a bit too ‘touristy’ but it was definitely worth a visit.
"September 27, 2018",5.0,Beautiful Views,"We visited here whilst in Corfu and the views are beautiful, The water near the beach was abit murky because the bottom and side of the rocks are clay, once you swim out abit the water is very blue and clear, we swam through the cave and jumped off the rocks, we also rented a paddle board which was a really nice experience, if you’re in the area I would recommend you visit here."
"September 26, 2018",5.0,Beautiful!,What a magical place! Mother nature at her finest. It's very easy to find. We took the bus from Acharavi. It's a 5 minute walk from where the bus stops. There's a path that you can walk round the cliffs are the views are spectacular. Not particularly suitable if you are unsteady on your feet. Well worth a visit.
"September 25, 2018",5.0,Magic place,"Amazing place! I was surprised how beautiful view I saw. Nice and warm water, jumping into water from cliff. Love it!"
"September 24, 2018",5.0,Highlight of your stay,A must to go and see and swim in the channel of love. It is beautiful with some wonderful scenery. Theres plenty to do here in Sidari with lots of bars and restaurants and shopping. We stayed in Kanoni but hired a car to see this place and we are so glad we did. Cedar is definitely the place to be

"September 22, 2018",5.0,Fantastic place,"Visited Sidari in September 2018 and stayed in Canal D^Amour area. It is a spectacular area, unique rock formations, sheltered coves, crystal clear water, very shallow in parts. Lots of sunbathing space on the rocks. Great for diving. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area to relax and enjoy the wonderful views. Aquarius restaurant has lots of seating where you can have a drink or snack by day and candlelight meal at night and enjoy the fantastic sunrises and sunsets. Canal D^Amour is a very special place."
"September 21, 2018",2.0,Not impressed,Went for a walk by the Canal D'Amour and was not impressed. Had to cross a foul smelling canal to get there. Nothing really there. A few shops and restaurants but nothing worth going there for.

"September 18, 2018",5.0,Besutiful area,Beautiful area with little coves and bays with amazing views. Some nice little restaurants to enjoy lunch or a cocktail or two. Lovely part of Corfu.
"September 18, 2018",2.0,Nice landescape...for not too stay,"The place is a jewell of the nature, but ...absolutelly full with tourist, shouting microphons telling you about offers and dances. If you look for grat land scapes, you can go to many others in the island no so spoiled. If you look for lots of british tourist and cheap food...this is your place"
"September 18, 2018",3.0,The place stinks and is full of wasps,Don’t know what all the fuss is about with this place.  Yes there is a nice view from here but that is it.  There is a horrible stench coming from loads of dead fish under the bridge.  If you sit for a drink you’ll be sharing it With countless wasps  Worth a look but that’s it. On the plus side there are some nice restaurants nearby offering quality food at reasonable prices
"September 17, 2018",5.0,Wonderful,Ive been there with my boyfriend it is such a romantic place that every one have to visit .i suggest it..
"September 17, 2018",5.0,Stunning,"Glad we saw this as spent a few hours watching the younger ones jump off the cliffs into the water, not for me but great to watch"
"September 17, 2018",3.0,Not a Canal of Love,Beach is very narrow and the people are on the beac crowded together like sardines far too busy some bars close by but parking a nightmare I would not recommend a visit
"September 17, 2018",3.0,Nice to see,"You will see some nice views from this place. Unfortunately the place became a too big of a tourist attraction, which causes it loosing its charm. Nevertheless if you are in the North of corfu, you should visit it."
"September 17, 2018",5.0,Excellent beach with lovely views,Loads of areas to swim with lovely views plenty of sea activity’s and plenty of bars and shops close by
"September 17, 2018",3.0,Disappointed,It was ok nice to look at but I was expecting a canal to swim along. Beware of people on boats and canoes!
"September 16, 2018",5.0,Breathtaking natural beauty,"This is a truly natural beauty spot. Just a 15 min walk from Sidari this is definitely a must see. Great place to eat and drink and swim. Photographers dream. Well worth a look, you will not be disappointed."
"September 16, 2018",5.0,Beautiful little beach,Lovely little beach. Perfect for the kids. Lovely bar and restaurant next to it. Definitely recommended
"September 16, 2018",5.0,Beautiful,"A great place to visit and even better to stay, so many great restaurants and views. One of the prettiest and most accessible places on the island. Within 15 minutes walking at least 100 bars and tavernas, beautiful beaches, clear waters. Everything from full English breakfasts for €3 euros to fine dining."
"September 16, 2018",5.0,Beautiful place,Love this beach so beautiful the rock formations are stunning definitely worth a visit. The big canal damour beach sign is a nice touch to the scene
"September 15, 2018",5.0,Idyllic,"Beautiful place to visit, we loved it, sandstone rocks with a beautiful sunset. Good clean beaches, plenty of sun beds too"
"September 15, 2018",5.0,Lunch,"Went here for lunch on 2 separate occasions, both times very good, had longer wait second time and was given free soft drinks. Can use sunbeds and beach free of charge. Really lovely. Its round the back of other part of Canel D'Amour, have lovely garden,s to lay on beds, pool area."
"September 14, 2018",4.0,Lovely views,"Had a walk up here with my wife plus my brother in law & my sister in law, when you walk up to the top through the bushes the views are amazing you can see all the resort, we spent about an hour here & we all enjoyed it, if you have the chance to go I would recommend."
"September 13, 2018",3.0,"Crowded, cheap and nasty",Compared with so many other lovely inlets and bays this is done to death and overrun with package holiday tourists on a deal. You won't find many Greek people here despite the fact that the sea is lovely but there are strong currents so it isn't suitable to all. Don't plan on having a nice lunch here as the restaurants are pretty poor.
"September 12, 2018",3.0,"Overcrowded, unenjoyable",This is a short piece of sandy beach with about 20 sun beds (lady turns up very quickly for €10). It would probably be nice if it wasn’t so little and thus so overcrowded. You can swim and certainly see the Albanian mountains which are pretty but overall I think the place doesn’t do justice to its name. You won’t miss anything if you don’t visit this place.
"September 12, 2018",5.0,Honeymoon,"Lovely place, worth the visit, Sidari is full of nice places but very quiet. Great for couples. Glad we decided to visit."
"September 12, 2018",5.0,ROCK DIVEING,would recommend you takeing dive of the rock. blue sea amazing followed by a icecream in many cafes close by.
"September 11, 2018",4.0,Swimming,Jumping from the cliff tops to the clear blue waters kept us entertained and was really genuine fun.
"September 10, 2018",5.0,Beautiful,"Worth a visit but only if your nearby, beautiful clear water, popular for swimming and jumping off the cliff."
"September 9, 2018",5.0,Fantastic views,Probably over commercialised a little. Would have been better if not over-run by sunbeds. There was literally no beach left uncovered. Still worth a visit.
"September 9, 2018",5.0,Amazing view,If you desire to see some rocks in a special shape as s carstic phenomenon then you have to visit Canal d'Amour. You have a complete view over the whole bay. The beach is small so you might go a few meters to the left until Sidari beach.
"September 8, 2018",4.0,Spectacular views,"Amazing views, you can see Albania as well! The cliffs are wonderful, but it can get quite windy and dusty. It's worth a visit however!"
"September 8, 2018",5.0,Nice stopover dtring North Corfu visit,"Beautiful bay, worth to visit and swimm in the sea. Friendly small bars, hotel around, Nice view around tha area"
"September 5, 2018",4.0,Unique place,"Canal D’Amour We were staying at Roda and called at Sidari for the day and thought we had better check out the Canal D’Amour. Access by car is easy enough with plenty of parking near the top of the cliffs, which is free. Access to the cliffs and then into the sea is more difficult for those less than fully able bodied. It’s quite a beautiful spot and the geology and caves are interesting. The sea is funnelled into the bays that are created and is akin to a giant wave pool. Not much of a beach area, especially with the tide in. Didn’t use what sun loungers were there (pay). If you are near Sidari it’s a must see even if you don’t stay there for too long."
"September 4, 2018",1.0,What a Dump!,"Do you like crystal clear water, clean beaches, and tranquillity? Then better not go to Canal D'Amour. We actually started laughing when we arrived - it was utterly grotesque."
"September 2, 2018",4.0,Beautiful spot,"Beautiful spot to visit,if you decide to jump in the water,be ready for cold water. But the beach near Canal is not great,dark sand mucky water and to many tourist.No beautiful views around the Channel."
"September 2, 2018",4.0,pretty place to walk,"A beautiful view, especially at sunset. So many people walking around during August and some of the pathways around the area were falling into the sea. I found it incredibly sad that there was so much litter in the area. I don't understand how humans can spoil such an amazing place :("
"September 2, 2018",3.0,Interesting but too many people.,"To stay on the beach was too crowded and to have a beach lounger, it was 10 Euro each. Ridiculous because who does that money go to? Who OWNS that beach?"
"September 2, 2018",5.0,Wonderful views,"Canal D'Amour cove is absolutely wonderful. We visited while on holiday, There is plenty of bars and restaurants, Some with sea views"
"September 1, 2018",5.0,Best mud mask I’ve ever had,"Sidari beach is awful but canal d amour I liked, yes it too could do with a bit of a clean up as there are bits of junk on the beaches broken loungers and brollies etc but the water is amazing and the natural mud on the rocks makes for thee best ever body and face mud mask you’ll ever try, sit and let it bake on in the sun then jump in the water to remove WOW our skin was awesome. Some bars there too serving cocktails etc, as a bit of a hippie I loved it and so did my wife and 12 year old daughter."
"September 1, 2018",4.0,Beautiful Place to visit,"We stayed at Canal Damour for our 2 week holiday with two children 11:13. It was prefect for us , beautiful beautiful views on the morning of awakening.  Watching the brave people cliff diving all around was spectacular.  It was a 5 minute walk to a bigger beach , where all the water sport amenities were available .  Perfect location - fantastic tavernas and little souvenir shops . Not tacky and a supermarket at the end of our road .  For us a family of four , our first ever visit , we LOVED it and were glad we chose the quieter area of Canal D’amour .  Beautiful place"
"August 31, 2018",3.0,not for kids,The view is beautiful but is ok just to cross by. It is not enough space for relax just for take a bath and move on.
"August 30, 2018",4.0,Little walk around sidari,Nice little place to visit esp if tide is coming in and the surge of water is quite a sight. Nice hour or two to pass the early evening
"August 29, 2018",1.0,What is all the fuss about?,As attractions go this has to be one of the worst I have ever been to. A scruffy piece of beach surrounded by tavernas. Allow 5 minutes for your visit including travel.
"August 29, 2018",4.0,Ok,"Visited canal damour in August for a week....it’s ok but not much to write home about , it’s very scenic and it’s nice to jump off the rocks but it’s a small beach and gets packed quickly"
"August 29, 2018",5.0,"this place is lovely, with fantastic views",think this may well be one of the more expensive places to stay but if you have the money to do it. why not.
"August 29, 2018",5.0,What an experience!!!,"My hubby and I spent a good few hours here, swimming in the warm sea, covering ourselves with the clay mask! The swim through the cave was amazing and well worth the effort!"
"August 29, 2018",4.0,Nice few,Nice location to visit in Sidari. In Sidari otherwise there is not much to see. Easy to park nearby. And plenty of restaurants to have a drink or something to eat.
"August 29, 2018",3.0,Looks better on the pics,"This place looks better on the pics. There were waste in bushes, beach was a bit dirty and the water was cloudy. Not wanted to go to swim."
"August 29, 2018",5.0,Lovely area,"Great panoramic views amazing beach. Best beach bar in the area is the Mojito where you get great service from Dimitris and another young girl, which I am sorry I forgot her name. Dimitris makes you feel so welcome that you want to keep going back every day!"
"August 29, 2018",4.0,Nice morning walk,Great walk along the beach to Canal D'Amour. Beautiful location and views. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Corfu
"August 29, 2018",5.0,Great place!!!!!,With my wife we spent a day in Sidari and enjoyed the place. The water is warm and clean and you can climb onto those cliffs and jump from there. The beach is small therefore I would suggest to take long chairs near a pool. The only condition is to drink something as the chairs are free. We took one drink and enjoy the place for the whole day
"August 28, 2018",3.0,Interesting but just the once,"The rock formations are fascinating and the swim through the tunnel was a great experience. However water v murky due to clay material. Beach is tiny and as ever charged for loungers. Have seen it, enjoyed it but wouldn't rush back again as other beaches on island nicer to spend day. The main town is one of those British friendly strips eg bars with sky, fried breakfast, Guinness on tap and endless souvenir shops- horrible not what I come on holiday for but suits many compatriots"
"August 28, 2018",5.0,Beautiful place to stay,Stayed here in early August and had a great time some lovely beaches to visit and some good night life too only a 5 minute walk into so dark where there are plenty of bars and restaurants will go here again
"August 27, 2018",5.0,fantastic,"if u go sidari u hav too go here it is breath taking watching the waves crash though the gauge, u can watch people jump and dive in they have some balls"
"August 27, 2018",3.0,"Beautiful location, too much people","It was way too much people, probably better in June or September. Felt like having an uncomfortable, lukewarm bath with 500 people . Water was unclear, mostly to do with natural clay that people kept smearing their bodies with. Cool small cave you can swim through."
"August 27, 2018",2.0,"Ugly, dirty, crowded place.","This place, like Sidari, is overrun with tourists (mostly families with kids), crowded to the point of bumping into people and really quite ugly. Dirty, pedestrian and boring, don't bother."
"August 26, 2018",5.0,Holiday,"Brilliant experience, rubbing rock all over body like mud bath, water shallow n as warm as a bath, u can walk out rather far out in sea , fabulous time"
"August 26, 2018",5.0,The Best Beach in Sidari,"This little cove is great, you can swim out to the end of the cove and climb out on tho the rocks and sunbathe"
"August 25, 2018",3.0,Not missing much - better from boat,"Its very crowded - some nice bays, but mainly all hotels and bars. You wouldn't be missing much if you went. Get a better view from a boat as you can see all the cliff formation etc"
"August 24, 2018",4.0,Go early,"It's gorgeous and lovely to walk around, it gets busy very early so if you want photos with less random people in go early!  Really lovely geological structures."
"August 23, 2018",5.0,Well worth seeing from both land and sea.,"You dont really get the full apreciation of this feature without seeing it from the sea. It is within easy reach of the Pedalo, Kayak and obviously then the power boats you can hire. Its a beautiful rugged landscape and worth the effort to reach it by sea too. Access by land will also give you stunning views of the bay and be sure to go to all penisula tips."
"August 22, 2018",4.0,Lovely place to visit,A must when staying at the canal d amour area. I swam through the cave it was a little choppy at the other end but glad I had a go. The water is shallow at first no good for children that can’t swim. The clay from the walls is a must. We did this twice and enjoyed it. Didn’t try the beach but beautiful views as our hotel was right behind this place. Great sunset from here too.
"August 22, 2018",3.0,Nice but crowdy,Probably high season it's the reason. So you get the idea... My girls like better the almiros beach.
"August 22, 2018",5.0,Beautiful,We've been here many times and it's perfect. Beaches are nice and the sea is shallow for quite a distance. There are two rocks to swim to and the water is clear. It's a must to visit in Sidari!
"August 21, 2018",4.0,Good but average,"Nice clean beach, very kids friendly as the water is shallow. We really liked it, did not have the feeling that is overcrowded or too loud. Yes there are many families as everywhere else. Quite mainstream but still good."
"August 20, 2018",5.0,Holiday,We visited this outstanding area and we were completely blown away with the beauty of it. All I can say is it is well worth the walk there and there is several photo opportunities on route.
"August 20, 2018",4.0,Beautiful,We went here 18months ago in May and it rained nearly all of the week we were there. And enjoyed the canal so much we wanted to see it in the sunshine and it was amazing didn't let us down
"August 18, 2018",4.0,You've got to do it,"If your in Sidari then you have to swim through the Canal d'amour don't you. Access to the beach isn't really suitable for anyone with any sort of limited walking ability as steep steps are part of the route down. The water is relatively shallow (I could stand up and I'm 5'9"") right up to the entrance and 3/4 of the way through the tunnel. Once through you are in to the clear deeper waters of the med. Like I've said your in Sidari, you have to do it, it's traditional."
"August 18, 2018",5.0,Impressive spot,One of the nicest places at northern Corfu ! It definitely deserves a visit. There are lovely beach bars and restaurants all over and you it is also easily reachable by car.
"August 16, 2018",4.0,reasonable priced beer,"there is a coastal type path that runs along most of the coast that covers this area well, the area is good for wheelchair users but there is also a few hard to reach more better for able bodied. there is many areas to jump into the sea below and there is two cafes/pubs beer at 2 euro a pint , ideal for the sunset which is very good to watch. the ground does have a paved path for the not so abled but limited areas this runs to. there is no charge to the cliff"
"August 16, 2018",5.0,"Good beach, views and sea swims","This area has little rocky outcrops and small beaches. You can walk most of the clifftop, swim round, through a cave etc. Very popular with Greeks as well as tourists. Water is shallow so good for swimming a fair distance. Not good for snorkeling as there is no visibility near the beaches and very few fish."
"August 16, 2018",3.0,Small cove,This is a small cove where the water is mirky due to the clay in the area the sun beds are expensive at 4 Euros each and its not a full day excursion but its worth a visit
"August 15, 2018",4.0,Cliff jumping,Interesting place for swimming through the caves and jumping from the cliffs if you are brave enough
"August 15, 2018",5.0,Canal D'amour at sunrise was amazing,We stayed at the Canal D'amour for 2 weeks and the sunrise was amazing. It has stunning views and is by far the better place to stay in Sidari
"August 15, 2018",3.0,Worth a quick visit,"Decided on a quick stop at this spot to see what all the fuss was about. It was easy to find and easy access. The area was heaving with plenty of rude Europeans. Stayed for about an hour and half whilst the boys jumped off the 20ft rocks. The rocks are covered in clay and it was fun to cover ourselves , let dry and wash off for a smooth exfoliation. It’s worth a quick visit just for the experience but beware it’s super busy. There are no showers to wash as well"
"August 15, 2018",2.0,Not a great place,"Looks great on pictures, but is extremely small, very difficult to walk in the water as the bottom is clay like substance. Beach is tiny and very overcrowded, do not pay extortionate day trip prices from other resorts to go here, as it does not pose value for money. We went in our hire car and stayed just a couple of hours."
"August 15, 2018",4.0,Beautiful,"Amazing views well worth a visit, great picture opportunities, great atmosphere and lovely tavernas situated around the Canal D'Amour"
"August 14, 2018",5.0,Paradise in Corfu,"Wow it's simply a beautiful amazing bar & restaurant. Stunning view's, and a drinks list to die for , catering for all ages and tastes.. It's just a dreamy place to chill out and be totally relaxed and entertained. And the added bonus if your a thrill seaker there is a cliff to jump off in to the crystal clear waters, no joke it brilliant and it right next to the Canal D'amour. Once you've been, I'm sure you will return. Enjoy."
"August 14, 2018",5.0,Cliff diving,This is a spot for people to dive off the cliffs and swim in the caves. The beaches are rubbish here and the sun beds have to be paid for.
"August 13, 2018",3.0,Interesting experience 🤪,"Having visited the place with my family, I can say that it is an interesting experience, but not to be repeated. The place was overcrowded and the rental of sunbeds was overpriced. We stayed there for one hour or so, we have covered ourselves with clay, swam a little bit and left. Nothing great, but still a good experience to remember 👍"
"August 13, 2018",4.0,wonderful views,"You can get a wonderful view of the canal from the mountain. I liked swimming in the canal but there were too many people for my liking. A bit too commercial, but definitely worth visiting"
"August 11, 2018",5.0,Lovely place.,"My wife and I are staying at Christos Apartments on the Canal D'amour and we love it. There's a great mix of things to do and places to go locally. The cliffs and scenery, the various beaches, the traditional Greek tavernas and restaurants as well as Sidari being a 10min walk away for pubs and clubs and great night life!"
"August 11, 2018",3.0,A long drive for little reward,"Apart from some interesting cliffs, Canal D’Amour was disappointing. There were so many tourists and snack bars and so much musak that the natural beauty was somewhat swamped. If you want real beauty without all the tourist tat, head for Porto Timoni beach. It’s a bit of a trek, but well worth the effort."
"August 10, 2018",5.0,Clayton Family Holiday,Amazing views and great swimming and the most amazing sunset 🌅 an amazing restaurant to give you all the views a most visit in Corfu
"August 10, 2018",5.0,Stunning,"Visited here last week with my family, absolutely beautiful area and great views , has a few sunbathing areas and restaurant/bars . Definitely worth a visit in staying in the area ."
"August 9, 2018",3.0,Much better coves elsewhere on the island,Only stayed for an hour despite only staying 10 minutes away.  Far to busy and water had lost it's lovely colouring- probably due to the mounds of people in the water.  Shame really.  Much nicer small beaches in Corfu.  Worth a short visit perhaps if you're in the area
"August 8, 2018",5.0,Still Beautiful,"3 rd time back to Sidari, 2nd to Canal D’Amour and the Kanali apartments.. stunning weather and views x great hospitality x absolutely love the place x kids did too"
"August 7, 2018",4.0,Stunning views,Stunning views and a good place for cliff jumping and easy access to local restaurants and bars and other close by beaches.
"August 7, 2018",3.0,Don't bother,During the summer season the tiny beach is full of people and the water loses its great turquoise colour. It looks much better in the pictures!!
"August 5, 2018",5.0,Canal d'amour Sadari,Stunning beach area and lovely lively town. Lots of live entertainment bars and restaurants Free use of sunbeds in beach bars if you eat or drink in there
"August 5, 2018",5.0,Amazing views,I walked here with my friend from Legends Apartments on a very sunny day and I could say it had a breath taking view
"August 5, 2018",5.0,Natural beauty,Nice place to spend a few hours. Natural rock formations. Wonderful views. Nice place to go for a swim.. cliff jumping in a couple of places if your brave enough. Plenty of food refreshments available nearby. A little busy and people should respect the area by taking their litter home.
"August 4, 2018",3.0,Chalk and Cheese,"As the title suggests Canal D'Amour is a game of two halves. The opening gambit is a thoughly embarrassing affair which shames me for being part of the human race. The litter and detritus from badly managed tourist influx and our own individual lack of responsibility to our planet is a total embarrasment... It really is shameful. So for this bit I give a zero rating and beseech all those that visit this area of natural beauty to take home their rubbish and also one or two bits of horrendous plastic waste that will be sprinkled about the place.  The second half is pure natural beauty which only intensifies the embarrassment of the first half performance.  Beautiful sandstone strata constantly eroded by the persistence of the ocean beautifully illustrates the consistent eloquent force of nature. Such a shame therefore that this is within the context of short sighted, selfish and crude irresponsibility for our natural environment and that of our children."
"August 3, 2018",4.0,Stunning,Sidari is very touristy but the Canal D'Amour is very beautiful and well worth a visit. You can also do some water sport activities while you are there from the main beach
"August 3, 2018",5.0,Fantastic,"Canal D’Amour is so perfect! It’s about a 15 minute walk from Sidari right up to the rock at the top of the Canal! The sights at the top are perfect - definitely take your camera!! The water is a beautiful aqua blue/green colour - try to avoid a windy day though, we ended up absolutely covered in sand because the wind was so strong."
"August 3, 2018",5.0,We just got engaged here! 😁,Beautiful place although very busy at mid day im unsure about other times. Now a place close to my heart as my partner proposed to me on top of the cliff overlooking the beautiful scenery!
"August 2, 2018",5.0,Amazing view and beautiful nature,You cannot be in Corfu without visiting this beautiful place. if you are young and not afraid from heights it is possible to jump to the sea and it's not so scary.
"August 2, 2018",5.0,Amazing sea erosion of sandstone,"On the outskirts of Sidari, the area is well worth visiting both by day and for the sunsets. It consists of a number of channels where the sea has cut through the sandstone, with a path which offers great views. There are a number of excellent restaurants nearby."
"August 1, 2018",5.0,Simply stunning!,Nature at its most splendid! Walk along the cliff top paths to see the crevices & caves - also lots of opportunities for adrenaline junkies to leap into the sea below.
"August 1, 2018",5.0,Great swim,Nice swim and interesting attraction to do with kids. Good sea and it’s accessible from the land and water (by boat)
"August 1, 2018",5.0,amazing location,nice beach very close to Zafiris hotel. the views are breath taking and the weather is amazing. it was a small cove near our hotel but had a cave that you could swim through
"July 31, 2018",5.0,"Unique, impressive natural feature","Canal d'Amour is a natural channel that has been created by wave action. It lies within a headland that is equally impressive. Great geology, lovely views over Sidari and well worth a visit."
"July 31, 2018",5.0,Lovely location well worth a visit,"Gorgeous views at canal d amour and well worth a visit but naturally it is very popular so very busy. We paid for sunbeds and spent an afternoon enjoying the calm water, the tunnel and the cliff jumping. The pictures make it look secluded but it actually has restaurant's around it so not very peaceful."
