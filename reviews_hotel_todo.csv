1/1/1111,50,Just amazing,"Just can not fault this hotel, itâ€™s hard to know where to start!    The view is incredible, you can see for miles across the ocean from the infinity pool, we swam early every morning and it was truly breathtaking.    We chose breakfast only so walked into Benitses most evenings, about a 20 minute walk downhill and then called the hotel to pick us up when we were ready (â‚¬20), one evening we went to Corfu Town, it cost us â‚¬210 return for 9 of us.    We ate at the hotel in Koh, it was amazing, quite possibly the best meal of the holiday.    Breakfast is fantastic, so much choice.    There is a small private beach which we went to once as there were no loungers and the bar wasnâ€™t open but this was because itâ€™s late October.    The turndown service was excellent, burning incense, chocolates, new towels & slippers.    It was my birthday whilst there and I returned to a beautiful cake in the room.    We travelled as a group of adults and children in school holidays, unfortunately some couples werenâ€™t happy with our children being in the pool and complained but the staff dealt with this very well explaining to the complainants that it is a family friendly hotel.    All in all an awesome holiday."
1/1/1111,50,Corfu's Absolute Best,"The service, food, amenities, views, and drinks, were beyond incredible. We hit the resort lottery for our first trip to Corfu. We also did a private dining birthday experience that was bananas (in a great way)! The restaurant manager, Alexander, treated us like royalty and made great wine recommendations. I would come back in a heartbeat."
1/1/1111,50,Perfect stay in Corfu,Our stay in Angsana was delightful. We enjoyed absolutely everything. Attentive stuff. Thank you Aleksandra and all othersðŸ’› for warm hosting and care. Amazing experience in SPA and great time in yoga classes.  Very friendly for families with kids.
1/1/1111,10,Terrible customer services.,"The first day to stay, they provided a disabled room for us. The point is we are not disable. And the bathroom after shower is whole wet!!! I need to put all the towel to floor and make it dry and safe.    After that we contact the reservations and let them know. They change my room as what I booked before and said it was very full that why last night we provided a disabled room for you. I think it was ridiculous for this organization.    Secondly is room service came wrong room when we were sleep and wake us up. The room service is delivery the duvet to another room and came wrong to my room. The staff was apologize truly. So not big deal for us.    ============================================    Terrible customer services. Holding my deposit and didn't refund so far. However, the staff said nothing to paid when I check out.    While I realize the deposit didn't refund, I email them twice last week. Also nothing respond so far.    Finally I contact their live chat, ''I am sorry to inform that as our chat service is not operated in hotel, we do not have information for refund process in our hand'',''May I request to kindly forward the email to the same address'' As 5 stars hotel respond like that  I feel very un-responsibility and disappointed."
1/1/1111,50,Paradise,"Stayed at Villa in Angsana Corfu. It was an amazing holiday. Everything in the Villa is thought out to the smallest detail: a clean warm pool, room cleaning 2 times a day, a comfortable bed, a luxurious bathroom, all the necessary bath accessories, a coffee machine and capsules of delicious coffee, water was constantly added, they also lit candles for us, every morning they left us candies. The room is incredibly comfortable. And besides that, it's just a fantastic view. The hotel itself has a very tasty breakfast, a huge selection for every taste. Excellent service. Friendly staff. If you want to see what heaven looks like?! Visit Angsana Corfu!"
1/1/1111,50,Very nice lunch,"We popped in a for a late lunch before flying out and it was a good choice. The staff are all very friendly and service is top notch. Lunch was excellent. Even as lunch guets, our car was valet parked."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing stay,"Amazing experience. Absolutely gorgeous property. Rooms are well equiped and full of little touches. The infinity pool overlooking the mediteranean is an absolute wonder. The SPA is huge, the food amazing. I just regret having only had time to try out one of the restaurants. But the best part of the stay was definitely the staff. Uniformly pleasant, engaged and present."
1/1/1111,50,"Thank you Angsana, see you soon!!!",We stayed in junior suite. The view was breathtaking and the suite was amazing and super clean. The personnel were absolutely professional and super helpful. The infinity swimming pool was even more beautiful than the photos. The breakfast and the restaurant were absolutely delicious no needed to leave from the hotel. At last but not least many thanks to the manager Mr. Karabelias for making us feel unique.
1/1/1111,50,Amazing stay,"From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were on love with the hotel. The staff were excellent, knowledgeable and professional.  The kids club was much appreciated too by my 4 year old son. He couldnâ€™t wait to go back every day.  Breathtaking views, excellent food and friendly people, canâ€™t wait to go back."
1/1/1111,50,Amazing holidays in Angsana,"From the first step in the hotel you can feel the 5-star atmosphere. Everything is amazing, the spa, the pool, the food and of course the kids area.
