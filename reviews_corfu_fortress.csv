"November 7, 2022",4.0,Did not tour the inside but walked the grounds,"We were part of a tour and did not go in to the rooms of the fortress. But the walk of the grounds was enough for us. It is impressive and little treasures (like the emblem of St. Mark's Venetian Lion), the wooden gates with all their battle scars, and the cannon (circa 1788, French, King Louis XVI) were rewards enough.  Perhaps the greatest appreciation we had for the fortress was how important a role it played in the lives and defense of Corfu Old Town. Construction began 486 years ago and it took 31 years to complete.  There was a little beach at the base of the fortress. Looks to be a major draw for the locals!"
"October 17, 2022",4.0,Great place to visit and excellent value for money,"Great place to visit and excellent value for money. Fabulous views from the top, over Corfu town and the strait towards the Greece mainland and Albania. An enjoyable walk around, it is worth reading the fortress's history beforehand to bring it into context. The onsite restaurant is very expensive, so suggest eat before our after. The gift shop has limited stock. There are toilets onsite. Recommend having good footwear / shoes as the steps to the top can be slippery."
"October 11, 2022",5.0,amazing fortress,"to start its 6 euro,s to get in .consesions for over 60,s is 3 euro,s worth every penny as we say ,if you are disabled you are going to struggle with all the steps in there ,old english garrison barracks inside ,wher you will find old cannons and amazing views of all around there ,lovely cafe serving lovely food on the plateus grounds .then onward walking up steep paths and the many steps to get to the top ,fabolous views from up there of corfu town and right across to the albanian coastline ,and all the bays around it .the fortess is surrounded by a old moat which now houses boats ,and a small beach down there .really enjoyed it there and worth the visit just to see the culture of previous tenants who occupied it ."
"October 10, 2022",4.0,"Must see in Corfu town, but try getting there…","Nice open-air museum with excellent viewpoint at the top. There is a museum shop, bar and toilets are also available. The way up is mostly stairs, and i didnt see any possibility for disabled persons to reach the top, so check at the gate, entrance fee is six euro. You can take guided tours as well if you want to get more background. But: and this goes for the WHOLE of Corfu: parking a car is hell. Even in october (low season) almost every parking space available is occupied. Either be prepared for some search&park, or take public transport into town. Or rent scooters in the areas where the busses dont serve."
"September 25, 2022",3.0,Very interesting,A large former fortress worthwhile to visit. Access was free when we visited. Elf & safety hardly present with plenty of unprotected sheer drops although unlikely to happen but….. However probably the most interesting building/ complex
"September 19, 2022",4.0,Great views,"Extensive views of Corfu old town and Albanian coast from the Old Fort however there was no guide available just a map to refer to by the entrance and lighthouse. There are exhibitions within the Old Fort that provide a focus. Worth reading up about the history of the venetian fort, moat and the Ottoman siege repulsions before visiting."
"September 15, 2022",4.0,A must visit for Corfu,"It costs €6 to enter. Less for concessions or students etc.  There are many exhibits inside that detail the history of Corfu under its many different rulers influence. A fabulous glimpse into the past.  Inside there are toilets and a cafe which has fantastic views. Very very limited vegan options for those that concerns.  The view from the top is fantastic. Really worth the climb. There is shade to rest on the way up, but once you’re up there there is no shade. Take sunscreen, plenty of water and a hat.  It is just a brilliant sight to explore and you can get a sense of how big and imposing it is. I would love to see more of it opened in the future, and there were signs to suggest investment to improve the sight. So fingers crossed for this."
"September 12, 2022",1.0,"Nice view, very bad service","We entered at 19:00 (and payed the 6 euro ticket) and after 10 minutes a man told us in a very rude way that they are closing in 5 minutes. He started to push everybody out in an angry and violent way, although the closing time was 19:30. Although the view from the top is nice, it was a stressful experience, and didn’t worth the time and money. Also, the toilet was dirty, with no toilet paper and no soap. :("
"August 28, 2022",4.0,Great Fortress,"Interesting fortress Venetian and British architecture. Not too strenuous and there are 2 cafes within the fortress selling drinks and ice creams. great view from the top, can be slippery as the rocks in the path have been highly polished by the foot traffic. Several interesting cannons, British, Venetians and Russian."
"August 18, 2022",3.0,20 min walk through the location,"Must see attraction in Corfu, but no care about the tourists, other than sell them tickets. Inside nothing happen, no curator, no audio guide, no map of the location as ticket complementary, just to visit the ruins yourself."
"July 17, 2022",3.0,Fantastic view but otherwise not much to see.,"The old fortress offers a fantastic view of the city otherwise there is not much not see. It is interesting though to see the influence from the different periods (Venetian and British). Visit the fortress if you are in the vicinity, but don’t waste time traveling to see it."
"July 8, 2022",5.0,Absolutely beautiful!,Do not miss this part of Corfu. The place is beautiful and very romantic. I recommend visiting as the sun sets or at night.
"July 5, 2022",2.0,"phantastic view, very bad cafeteria","Nice visit, fantastic view, two bad points: - buildings are decadent - the lady at the cafeteria inside the fortress forced me to pay 2,50€ for 0,25 l take away bottle of water, even if the price list near the cashier shows 0,25€ and when I claimed she just said the price list is not for customers (for whom is it then?)"
"June 20, 2022",4.0,worth a visit,The fortress was free to enter after around 5pm but some of the best parts (including the highest point- the acropolis) were closed during this period. So we went back next day and a standard ticket is 6 Euros per person. Good view from the top.
"June 14, 2022",2.0,Seems like they could do so much more,"You basically pay to go up to the lookout for a view of Old Corfu town, and to see inside the British church. All the other buildings were closed off or in a state of disrepair.  There were a lot of people paying to enter and if it’s like that all the time it makes you wonder if they could afford to do restoration work on some of the old buildings or have some historic artifacts from the fortress periods on display.  You leave with not very much information of what it was like as a fortress or to be there in the past when it was built and used."
"June 14, 2022",5.0,Would recommend to anyone,"Really enjoyed the visit to the old fortress, really interesting history, not preserved the best but can be expected knowing the history, really informative and lovely views from the top too. Make sure to have a lot of water with you as gets really humid."
"June 13, 2022",5.0,Historic,"really interesting and lovely old Fort, with a working church still on site - you need goat legs to make it to the top, or you can just stop for a drink in the little bar and take in the views"
"June 6, 2022",4.0,Great Views,"Inexpensive, interesting and with a series of fantastic views across the town and out to sea in multiple directions. Quite steep in places so the best viewing spots are not for the less mobile"
"May 31, 2022",1.0,Nothing to see,"A whole 6 euros worth of nothing. Nothing to see, very badly maintained. All you can get is a view of the town from the top."
"May 30, 2022",4.0,Impressive area,This huge impressive area sticks out from the Old Town. You can stroll about the various parts. There is an old fortress and an old British hospital (closed).
"May 18, 2022",5.0,A must see,"We parked in the seafront and we walked to the fortress. The ticket is 6€, it's worth a visit. It's well preserved, we spent a few hours walking inside the walls, stopping at the bar on the top. Lively place to take some pictures, interesting to visit the church as well."
"May 12, 2022",4.0,Walking visit of old fortress,"Amazing fortress , that still allows you free reign to walk about for most of it. In good condition for the most part. Just watch your footing coming down from the highest point as the stones are smooth and slippy. Well worth the 6 euro entrance fee.  But beware the toilets."
"May 1, 2022",5.0,Sunset could be spectacular from there,"We were unfortunately a few minutes late to buy tickets, climb there 40 minutes and see the sunset. Please start abot 1.5 before sunset time to manage."
"April 13, 2022",3.0,"Worth it for the views, not a lot else to see",My husband and I stumbled across the Old Fortress on our first day in Corfu. Decided to go in and see what it was about.  6 euros full price and 3 for students - wasn't a bad price considering the size of the place. There really wasn't much there though. A few boards about some buildings but other than that it's just a nice place to talk around. Get to the top and you'll be rewarded with some amazing views of Corfu Town.
"April 3, 2022",1.0,Terrible l.,"Very bad experience, paid 12 euros to get into the old fortress and then when we tried to get into the chapel we were ushered out very rudely and told there was nothing there for us and we was not allowed in. Very disrespectful considering it was a chapel and definitely would not recommend going there as how disrespectful the people there were towards us as tourists."
"December 26, 2021",4.0,Massive,"This Venetian fortress dates back t the 15th century. Unfortunately, on our tour with Holland America there was no time or opportunity for a tour."
"November 7, 2021",4.0,"Massive structure, good views","Old Venetian fortress dating back to early 15th century and rebuilt through the ages. It's massive, built on the hill overlooking the Corfu town. Some exhibitions are held in the interiors of the area but it's the walls, old barracks, buildings, tower and the view from the top (just next to the lighthouse - be prepared for the way up) that really remain in the memory. Definitely worth a visit. Entrance price was EUR 6."
"October 29, 2021",5.0,Wonderful sights,Amazing sights as you drive into Old Corfu town to see the fortress taking pride of place. a beautiful setting - a lovely town .Spend the day there!!
"October 21, 2021",4.0,Great view over the city and Harbour,"Dates back more than 500years giving you a splendid, amazing view over the city. Quite nice to walk around and get impressed by the huge walls and the fortress layout. The 6euro is a worthy contribution for preservation and maintenance."
"October 8, 2021",5.0,Best Fort in Corfu,This Venetian fortress was the best attraction in Old Corfu Town. From the thick steep walls to the moats and the keep as well as the lighthouse it was a great exploratory tour. Be sure to go to the top for the best views. Don't miss the old prison and views of Corfu Town.
"September 30, 2021",4.0,Old fort climb in Corfu,We visited here on a brief stop from our cruise ship. Took about 2 hours to walk the site and it was a bargain at 6 euro for entrance fee. Many high school-aged visitors on our trip. The climb to the top of the light house rewards you with 360 degree views that are worth the admission.  We walked back to the cruise port and it was a reasonable walk of about 30-40 minutes.
"September 28, 2021",4.0,Superb Venetian Defense Architecture,This fort is a place I’ve been longing to visit for along long time. No disappointments there just as expected- well preserved fortress with plenty of cannons and structures from different periods. A masterpiece of Italian (Venetian) defense architecture. Unfortunately not fully restored and many areas are off limits. One can hire a boat and sail around the fort for view of the excluded areas. Only one thing bothered me - it’s the nearly complete lack of commemoration and honors to the people who built this place and died there. Warmly recommended for history buffs and for the whole family.
"September 26, 2021",4.0,Worth a visit,"We visited Corfu Town one day and had a wee trek around the old fortress, it was a decent outing and the views at the top were great. We booked the trip to Corfu through an events company in Sidari and were told it was free to enter but it is actually €6 per person.  Worth a visit."
"September 24, 2021",5.0,Beautiful views and space to explore,"We had a lovely time - the history's really interesting, but the opportunity to scramble up and down on the ruins (on and off the beaten path) is a great change of pace from the Old Town. Worth setting aside about 2 hours to get a bit lost and take your time."
"September 12, 2021",1.0,Rude people at the entrance were screaming 6€ Tickets,"Our last day in Corfu we wanted to visit the Old fortress of Corfu Town. At the entrance was a very rude Man screaming ,,Tickets Tickes''.We thought about buying them but the man he was looking at us in very angry way and discussing about us with an another man in Greek. He literally attacked us and also told us to go and visit an another Place. They charge €6 per adult and we could saw from up the trash down near the see unbelievable. With so many people visiting it on daily basis they should bring enough money to at least clean the trash out."
"September 8, 2021",4.0,Morning at the old fortress,"Visited the fortress on a Tuesday 10AM no que but this does seem to happen as the tour coaches arrive on the hour .  6 Euros and your free to roam the vast fort Many rooms are limiting numbers to 4 or 6 at a time and masks must be worn inside .  Head right out of the first corridor of buildings and head to the church great views of the harbour, before heading up the ten minutes walk to the very top point of the fortress the lighthouse ,tread carefully the cobles have been worn smooth and very slippy and the hand rails in the sun a bit hot to touch .great views worth the climb.  Definitely worth a visit if spending a day in Corfu town ,parking well can be difficult the parking by the fort was full by early morning so a 1km walk from the port side parking lots"
"August 24, 2021",3.0,Beautiful,"The fortress itself is a wonderful experience and superb value at 6 euros’s per person. We walked to the top and experienced the incredible views. A top tip would be wear sensible shoes, it can be slippery in Haviana’s coming down. However, our experience was slightly ruined by the rude lady in the cafe there. We ordered drinks and food. One bill was 10.60 and the other 9.40. In my calculation that totals 20 euros which we left on the table. Embarrassingly she called us back demanding another 30 cents. When I questioned her why she told me not to worry and dismissed me, but it was hugely humiliating and I still don’t understand where I needed to pay anything additional?"
"August 24, 2021",5.0,A lot of walking - amazing experience,"Sunday 22nd August and we visited this ancient Fortress an iconic landmark in Corfu Town.  It was constructed in the 15th century by the Venetians. The Fortress sits on an artificial island which was made by creating a canal linking the Gulf of Kerkyra and the Bay of Garitsa.  We paid the entrance fee of €6 each, card payments accepted. We proceeded over the small bridge spanning the canal and entered the Fortress through its mighty entrance gate.  There is so much see here which makes walking around such an interesting and enjoyable experience.  The clock tower was something that could not be missed as it stands tall. It was not telling the correct time.  The Saint George Church sits majestically in the corner of a large courtyard.  The former Chapel Latin (The Latin Chapel Madonna of the Karmelitae) which is now home to a Byzantine exhibition.  We also visited an exhibition of contemporary Greek art.  The challenge when visiting this old Fortress is to reach the dizzy heights and climb up to the top and see the old lighthouse. There is also a rusting metal cross up there. Definitely worth the climb for the panoramic views. Do take care, going up and down as the well worn stones are shiny and slippery underfoot in places.  Dotted around the Fortress were a number of old canons used in its defence. In 1994 the EU leaders visited the Fortress, a summit was being held in Corfu during the Greek Presidency of the EU.  So much restoration work has been completed and very evident.  It was not possible to access all areas of Fortress as some places were being renovated and restored or waiting to be done.  There is a restaurant within the old Fortress, €4.50 for a small bottle of beer, ouch, captive market.  The entrance fee into the Fortress is worth every cent of the €6, we enjoyed every minute and step.  It was very hot and large areas were exposed with no shade, so would recommend wearing some head covering and sun screen.  Face masks had to be worn in enclosed areas of the Fortress."
"August 8, 2021",5.0,Quite a climb,Even if you don’t go to the top it’s a very interesting place to visit especially for the history buffs amongst us especially for €6 older people over 65 get in for €3 plenty of interesting stuff and views it is a fair climb to the top due to uneven pathways and possibly slippery in places but excellent view all round from the top
"August 7, 2021",5.0,Beautiful,Don’t miss this when you are in Corfu! Gorgeous views and great history! The Walk is not bad at all and definitely worth it!
"August 1, 2021",5.0,Strategic Location,"The Old Fortress is at a strategic location guarding the old town, where most of the people lives in old times. You'll find a little beach there that is popular with locals and a couple places to eat and drink. Plus the history of the fortress."
"July 18, 2021",4.0,The Old Fortress in Corfu Town: well worth a visit.,"Really worth a visit. From the ramparts, and especially from the lighthouse, for those intrepid enough to make the uphill trek, one gets the finest views of Corfu harbor, and the waterfront. About the lighthouse, the walk up is both steep, and the cobblestone a bit slick, so be forewarned. The Church of St. George is lovely in its simplicity. In the Latin Chapel, there is currently an exhibition on the history of Jewish life in Corfu, Which is both fascinating and sobering. There is also a room with amazing early church frescoes, some going back to the 5th / 6th c AD. I would allow 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Big tip: the Fortress opens at 8 AM. Go then. Once it gets past 9-9.30, the heat gets intense, and it gets packed. If you get there when it opens, you have it yourself, and it’s not yet hot. Admission is 6 euros, 3 for those over 65."
"July 13, 2021",5.0,One of Corfu Town’s top Attractions!,"My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Benitses (staying at the new Angsana Corfu Hotel - Review to follow) and this morning we visited the Old Fortress of Corfu Town which is not only hard to miss but should feature on all visitors’ attraction visit lists!  The 3 Euro Entrance Fee for senior citizens (65+) such as us represents excellent value for money) for an extensive site that, with the help of EU Funding, has not only been refurbished but - together with both the New Fortress and Corfu Old Town - has UNESCO World Heritage Monument status.  Whether you decide to climb to the top of the Fortress or not (we didn’t as it was already over 30 degrees this morning), there is plenty to see as well as a nice Cafe/Restaurant to visit before you move onto your next Attraction!  All in all, well worth a visit and it would certainly be a shame to depart Corfu without having visited one of the two Fortresses!"
"June 24, 2021",1.0,Not worth the trouble,The view from the top was really not worth the time (and heat stroke) to get there. Stone stairs were slippery from wear and not a single shade to hide from the heat. The whole structure seemed abandoned and uncared for. Better stick to old town.
"June 24, 2021",5.0,old fortress,wonderful view at the top point to old town and mainland. There are canons at the frontyard still in good condition.

"October 21, 2020",4.0,Brilliant views,As we are a couple of oldies we only paid €3 to visit this attraction. We had been to Corfu several times before but there were always queues. Not this time!! Although it is quite a slog to reach the summit of the fort it is well worth it for the views. Not much else in there of major interest but its a large site to wander round for a few hours

"October 12, 2020",5.0,Magnificent,Huge fortress which must have been one of the biggest in Greece. Wonderful views from the top are well worth the climb up but care is needed on the worn stones which may be slippery. There is a cafe and a church too.
"October 9, 2020",5.0,Unmissable,"Any visit to Corfu town should take in the old fortress, its only 6 Euro to get in ( adult fee) and the place is much bigger than it looks and we easily spent nearly 2 hours walking around. There are numerous photo musts and the view from the top by the lighthouse is just amazing. Not only that the cafe and restaurant toilets are very clean and well maintained so its worth a visit just to use the loo's. Great for views, great for historians and great for photographers, so recommended for all."

"October 30, 2022",5.0,Beautiful place to swim,"A beautiful area to visit that is easily accessible by car with free parking. We started with a walk up the cliffs to see the stunning views on offer which was wonderful. We then pitched up on the small beach and dived into the sea. We swam through the ‘tunnel of love’ and spent some time jumping into the water. We then spent some time snorkelling further out to sea. It was truly a stunning place to swim with the beautiful coves and cliffs. However, I wouldn’t recommend if you are planning on sunbathing as the beach is small and I would imagine it would get very overcrowded during peak season."
"October 28, 2022",4.0,Popular and stunning attraction.,Take the cliff path route to Canel D'Amour past restaurants commanding beautiful views over the little beaches and bays below. Great place to sunbath and watch the braver ones jump and dive from small cliffs into the blue waters below but have to admit i didnt attempt it myself.....too my birthdays.There is also a sheltered sandy beach which can become very crowded at times and just above this is outdoor restaurant with panoramic views while enjoying a meal or a cool drink.
"October 6, 2022",4.0,Nice area,"Lovely area, nice scenery and plenty of shops, restaurants and bars to choose from. Some parts (i.e. the small beaches) can get a bit crowded but it's nice for a leisurely stroll."
"October 5, 2022",5.0,Canal D'Mour,"It is a beautiful place to visit with nice restaurants with beautiful views of the sea, some nice shops and bars, if you are fit you can go looking over the hill a lot easier as I have limited mobility I was unable to go there but it looked wonderful, we had some lovely meals at he Sea Garden and the Marie Beach Hotel, also if you go onto the beach you can hire a boat"
"September 27, 2022",5.0,Stunning views,"Definitely a must to visit. We stayed in Sidari and walked . Which was a pleasant walk even in the heat . I would recommend suitable footwear for the rocks and climbing even though lots had flip flops on. Stunning views and great atmosphere. It’s very busy which is expected as soon popular , it’s a must even if it’s just to take in the whole experience and get great photos. Beach was very busy but people coming and going so was easy to get a space . Sea was lovely and great for swimming the mud is great also to put on you write your name in the mud wall. People were jumping from high heights (not for us) good to watch swim through the caves . We didn’t eat or drink there but a few places to eat and drink near. Lovely part of Sidari. People were having a great time."
"September 24, 2022",2.0,Crowded and not sure what all the fuss is about,Pleasant enough beach but very small and was crowded. There are much nicer beaches available by car.
"September 22, 2022",5.0,Fagins bar and restaurant,"Loved the Canal D'Amour its lively but quieter than the main strip. A nice ammount of bars and taverna's and a couple of shops. Visited Fagins every day for breakfast which was lovely, plenty of options and service was fabulous. Sharon was very friendly and attentive, however we did go for our evening meal a couple of times and it was a different story. The food was perfect but the host Donna was very unorganised and often got ours and other orders wrong or mixed up. She just didnt listen to the customer so it all became a bit of a lucky bag. Nothing like the morning service Im sorry to say."
"September 20, 2022",2.0,Small crowded beach - lots of litter,"Small crowded beach - lots of litter, no sunbeds of umbrellas as shown on some photos & nowhere to clean the sand off your feat."
"September 18, 2022",3.0,Disappointed,"Very busy through the day, staying in the area so visited late when crowds disappeared. No where near as romantic as described probably because of crowds and rubbish left behind."
"September 7, 2022",5.0,Beautiful,"Worth to visit. The litle cave gives the best view if You aproach from the see, after You swimm trought the canal. Big parking lot at the entrance, costs 5 euro/day."
